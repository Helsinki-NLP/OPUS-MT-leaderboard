It is a matter of concern for Welsh Times ‘to have the appearance of clues’
There is some confusion among some TIMEs before the recommendation that their title should be changed to MPWs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The confusion arose as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Times around the political spectrum are feared that they would be a mockery.
One time with the Labour Party said his group was worried that “he rhymes with Twp and Pwp”
Tip for readers from outside Wales: Twp means silly and pwp shit in Welsh.
AM told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was “not more than satisfied, and alternative recommendations have been made.
One member of the Conservative Party said his group was broadly receptive to the change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet in English.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced the same as the pronunciation of the letter u in the English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the changes, said: "It is of course up to MEPs to make the final decision on any reporters under the name to be called Assembly Members."
The Welsh Assembly was given the power in the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published results with a public consultation in June on the proposals for widespread support for the Assembly's nomination as the Parliament of Wales.
In terms of the title of the AMs, Members of the Parliament of Wales (WMP - Welsh Parliament Members) were the Commission's choice, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation.
Time seems to be proposing alternative options, but the effort to come up with any opinion could be a heartache to the Commanding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation under the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the design of the system of committees.
The final vote on the question is when they will vote on the bill.
We have a polling day for the people of Macedonia in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the “Republic of North Macedonia."
A pact on the referendum was reached as part of an effort to resolve the many years with Greece on the border, in which a province with the name Macedonia is also found.
The government has long argued in Athens that the name of its northern neighbours is a demand for its territory, and successive objections to their application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the polls about the change of the name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid if there is to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Clock comes to silence and Chapels are failing in Harlem
Historically, the ancients I spoke to say there was a bar and a church around every corner," Mr Adams said.
They are not today."
He said he understood the process.
People go out in different ways today," he said.
The bars are no longer sitting rooms for the public where people go on a regular basis.
As for the churches, it is a concern that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and they will just be back where they started sooner or later."
The church could be replaced by apartment buildings, full of the kind of people who don't help the remainder of the refuge in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be people with bright healing," he said, "and accordingly they will speed up the day on which those churches will be completely closed because most of the people who move into those apartments are unlikely to be members of those churches.
The two churches were built with bright healing communities before Harlem became a major city for people with blue healing - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The original methodical community moved with bright healing out in the 1930s.
The title of the building was adopted by a community of blue healing, a community who used to worship close hands.
The Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against 125th Street retailers, a large shopping street in Harlem, opposed the recruitment of people with a blue spell, took over from St. Martin's under the Respect.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parishioners commissioned the bell when they proposed reconstruction plans.
The bell tower was baptised by the Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's.
An expert who played the bell in July called it something else: "Cultural treasure" and "a historical musical instrument whose counterpart could not be found."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first blue-curved musician, Dionio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said he was not represented by St. Martin's.
It has been a complicated story between architects and contractors who have been seen by St. Martin's in recent months, some of whom have introduced the secular leaders of the church, and others have been the episcopal diocese.
It was the beers - the parish's own governing body - who wrote to the diocese in July about their concerns “that the diocese would look forward to bringing the costs to the berths, even though the berths were not involved in the recruitment of the architects and contractors to whom the diocese sent them.
Some of the people of the parish complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark is diving in front of a lobster in California
A 13-year-old boy's shark attacked and attacked Saturday when he was diving in search of lobster in California on the first day of the lobster diet, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chadmel said he was diving with his friends for about half an hour about Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he was then tortured to help his removal from the heel.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a excitement from catching a lobster, and that he understood then “it was a shout ‘We were gripped!
We've been spoiled!"
It's all about each other," Hamel said.
I let everyone go from the heel, 'There's a shark under the heel!'" said Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is classified as having trouble.
It is not known which shark species were responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that shark appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but he was considered not to be a shark dangerous species.
Giles told him that traumatic injuries were removed for the victim of his body's cream.
The officials closed an entrance on the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for inquiries and for safety purposes.
Giles pointed out that there were more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to land on the UK's scheme market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their department store-style scheme passages and a team of special assistants on them.
The UK's £2.8bn scheme market is part of the considerable £2.8bn campaign, and continues to grow while fashion sales and household items are declining, the larger scheme passages will be tested in 11 stores around the country, and brought to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in scenic goods forms part of the supermarkets' effort to fill a space in the shelves where televisions, microwaves and household items were acquired at a time.
Sainsbury's said they would double the number of their scheme items offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup field, so that vegans will have the majority of usable products - which requires more young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will be testing concessions in both stores with Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out the year.
The trends of online shopping and to buy small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to make more to attract people in.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that multi-disciplinary stores will gradually look like the venues with the series of stores trying to get back against the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put Argos centers in hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitats since they bought those two series of stores two years ago, which they say has boosted grocery sales and contributed to the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate its scheme and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's joint venture with western Boots was tested at the beginning of the 2000s, but the connection was terminated after a confrontation about how to share proceeds from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
That new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business to 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy suite, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would perform a role in the plan, but adding a range of additions to the luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have radically changed the look and look of scenic passageways to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in expert colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands have been designed to fit all demands, and the attractive environment and convenient settings mean that we are now an excellent scheme target that sets a challenge to the old shopping route."
Peter Jones ‘were' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal
The star Peter Jones of Dragons was left crazy after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million deal with his business in the lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time available for his brand of household items and real accessories.
The pair's business and Goop brand have been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow..
It was on Instagram that the 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced that she is going to leave.
Holly Willoughby has put the star Peter Jones from Dragons Den on red when she withdrew from her profitable lifestyle brand business at the end - to focus on their new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Our sources of information said that Jones was ‘red in red’ when the white TV girl admitted during a Tuesday's meeting full of tension at the headquarters of her inner business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - worth up to £1.5 million - to focus on her household goods brands and True accessories.
The business was compared to Goop's brand with Gwyneth Paltrow, and was forecast to double Willoughby's wealth which is estimated to be equivalent to £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that she was going to depart from Real, Jones went on a jet plane out of Britain with one of his holiday homes as his goal.
The source said: "Really was at the head of priorities for Holly.
It would be a long-term future for her to pursue her life for decades.
Everyone involved was removed from their decision to leave the market.
No one believed in God's plan, but He did believe in God.
There is a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's Headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the event of the This Morning presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the business millions due to the significant investment in the products between cushions and candles and between clothing and household items, and further delays in its launch.
And it could end friendship that lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, having three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
It was founded in 2016 by Willoughby along with Capp and Jones, aged 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones holds 40 percent in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and take part as a representative of Ant McPartlin as host I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source of information close to Jones said last night, “We would not comment on matters relating to his business.
We fell in love and then we fell in love.
He laughed at the criticism he would receive from the news media for the “non-presidential” traffic to the eyes of some people, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why do you think President Trump has done so much?
Trump said as he pretended to be a “principal news presenter”.
I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim expressed interest in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
There have been more than three months since the Singapore summit in June when North Korea's leading diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea does not see a “responsive” response from the US to North Korea's initial efforts towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the U.S. is still implementing sanctions with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump wasn't very happy with his decision.
We're doing a great job with the North Koreans," he said.
We were going to fight with the North Koreans.
Millions of people would be killed if they did so.
And now we have a great relationship."
He said positive results from his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim - the rocket tests were eliminated, helped release kidnappings and bring home the bodies of members of the American armed forces.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about the relationship with Kim.
It's easy to be that presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get admission in this crowded spot, 200 people would be standing there," Trump said, referring to the crowd just in front of him.
Hundreds of people are killed on an island with a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, the foreign organizations were told that they did not need to be on the spot.
While more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population have been displaced from their areas, no national disaster has been announced, which is a pre-commitment to generate international aid.
In many cases unfortunately they say flawlessly they don't want international assistance, so it's a good challenge," said Mr. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is teaming up to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether the foreign team can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesperson with the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In view of the earthquake seen in Indonesia on an ongoing basis, the preparations before nature's misery are terrible.
Although shelters were built against tsunamis in Aceh, they are not a typical practice seen on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a warning base before a tsunami in Palu, although caution was in place, was probably a contribution to the number of lives lost.
Travel between the islands of Indonesia is challenging when it is done.
Natural disasters are much more complicated.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palau, and it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has improved Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and has spent a huge amount of money on roads and railways.
But Joko's administration experienced funding deficits as he embarked on his re-election the next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where some people from the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their towns when clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs took place on the streets, and masses, bows and arrows, and other rough weapons.
Daniel Sturridge finds Liverpool's final score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge secured Liverpool from losing the match against Chelsea in the Premier League with his score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri with about 30 yards away from Chelsea and his team back 1-0.
He took the ball on his left foot before trying to get the longest pole off him.
The attempt flew high above the box as it approached the top right corner of the net.
The ball went straight over the jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the end and fell into the grid.
I just wanted to get to that place, get the ball, and players like Shaq progress with as much as possible, so I just tried to prove as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante and I gave the ball a little bit of a blow and I didn't think so much about it and tried it on the back.
Chelsea was 1-0 ahead at halftime after scoring in the 25th minute with the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The center front with his brine for the team in the blue field crossed west as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from the midfield and taking a sprint about half Liverpool of the field.
Kovacic gave a pass and quickly disappeared in the middle of the park.
He then released a beautiful pass through it, led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and brought the final blow into the net of his longest pole with his left foot over Alison Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Naples at the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe Series at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of dead in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people have been reported to be stranded under the debris of the buildings laid by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit last Friday, and waves were generated as high as 20 feet, as the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press event.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was full of debris from buildings that fell into each other.
A 32-year-old man was arrested by police following a woman's death.
An investigation into a murder has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was discovered at 7:55 a.m. with wounds stranded on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
Police urged people in the area who heard or saw nothing to come to them.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are early in the investigation but I would appeal to anyone close to John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who thought anything with their right cameras could help us to contact us because they could have information that would be vital to our investigation.
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local woman in Birkenhead, and that she was found within property.
A friend of the lady who believed they knew her had come to the scene this evening to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing because police said they are informing the immediate relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left dumb when he learned of what happened.
Residents are now being told that there will be a number of times before they can re-enter.
One policeman was heard telling one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene and spilled the tears.
She says "this is terrible."
There were two vans with the police within the defensive line at 2pm, with one other van just outside her.
Several policemen were standing within the line of defense monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and mention log 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell's statue inside Parliament is the latest memorial to be the subject of controversy over the ‘rewrite of history'.
His destruction would be compensated for his full destruction such as the Taliban on many of England's religious cultural casualties under the hands of his fanatics or the Pilgrims as they were baptized.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as “mads” and as “an attempt to rewrite history”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate on the removal of the statues would be expected to result in the real Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace.
It wasn't Cromwell himself who ordered or made the idolaters in English civil wars.
A sacrifice of the Crumlin may be wrong for the actions of Thomas' ancestors in the first place.
The beautiful fact that William Hamo Thorneycroft invented Cromwell is evidence of speculation in the 19th century, and it is part of the historyology of a person many people believe to be worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people, perhaps more in the 19th century than in the present day, would consider Cromwell to be the parliament's defender against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
This is still an important debate on the subject.
It is absolutely certain that the conflict since the mid 17th century has shaped the development of our nation since then, and is an identifiable individual who serves as the representative of one half of that split.
It is also worth celebrating and commemorating his achievements as a Protector Lord."
Chinese farmer's killer pig attacks fiercely to death
A farmer's pig was attacked and killed within the southwestern market of Sine, according to local media reports.
The man with the dead surname ‘Yuan’ was discovered with his cut artery, drenched with blood near a pig's foot at the market in Liupanshui province of Guizhou, which the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
Pig farmer preparing to inject vaccines in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
It was reported that he traveled with his cousin from the neighbor Yunnan province last Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin came to him the next morning as he was dead, and found that a door valve with a nearby pig's aperture was spreading.
He said that there was a large male pig inside the chest with blood in his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the pig had either attacked the farmer or died, according to the report itself.
My cousin's legs were bloody and spoiled," said the cousin to the surname ‘Wu,' as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The film from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found around once more.
Neither Yuan nor his cousin was the animal that killed the man.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked in such a way that it would not attack anyone else, with the police gathering evidence at the scene.
It is reported that the Yuan people and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
There are records in the annals of cases where pigs have been made to humans although rare.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and suffered critical injuries.
A decade earlier, a pig of 650 pounds of Welsh farmerweight was entangled against his tractor or his wife scared the animal off.
After eating their farmer's pigs over in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normal, but a taste of the blood can act as ‘chicken.'
They're just trying to get away.
They belong to you, they are truly curious as animals... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to respect them," he said.
Heavy rain will come to the southwest of the U.S. from the remains with Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving it beyond the colder heel off the north coast of Mexico.
The floods with Rosa will come from a rainstorm across northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the next few days.
Rosa, which is a Category 1 hurricane, was hit by 85 miles an hour, as at 5 a.m. Eastern Sunday time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move from the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a pit is gathering over the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical humidity deep northward into the southwest of the United States.
Up to 10 hours of rain will come with Rosa to parts of Mexico next Monday.
Heavy rain will then be created with the tropical humidity interacting with the pit approaching into the Southwest for a few days.
There will be between 1 inch and 4 inches of rain causing dangerous turks, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates coming to 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the Southwest are expected to fall between 2 and 4 inches of rain, especially over most of Arizona.
Tullies may occur with the rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It became a decision to go out into the desert on foot with the risk of tropical storms there.
The heavy rain may cause terrible flooding on the rivers in the plains, and local wind and dust gusts will come with the thunderstorms.
Some heavy rains will come along with the pit approaching parts of the southern coast of California.
The number of rains may be above half-soil, which may generate minor debris flows and slippery roads accordingly.
This was the first rain of its wet season at the region.
Some tropical rain showers will start slowly approaching Arizona on Sunday and early Monday, before the rain slowly spreads over Monday and Tuesday next.
A heavy rain will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last for Wednesday.
Severe temperatures in the temperature can be seen in October throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, with the hot zone staying relatively warm.
As a result, changes occur over time.
A great example of the amazing temperature variations will be seen throughout the middle of the Sam's Sunday.
The temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa will vary by nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the final heat of the summer will try to grow again.
It is predicted that a warm start for October will be seen for many of the mid and east U.S., with the temperature in the 80s being widespread over the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
80 degrees could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and 10 degrees would be in and out over the average temperature.
We are indicative of a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the fascinating evidence from the nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and the woman who accused her of sexual assault, with the allegation that the attack occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, with the broadcasters breaking into regular registration for the final episode of Friday: an agreement negotiated with Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake to lead an investigation into the changes that will happen one week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she is one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had hobbled her while intoxicated, and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his southern testimony, claimed that he is one hundred percent certain that it did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were likely to have seen more than 20.4 million people.
That business included the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks on display, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
There are a lot of people who don't understand the number of people who come into the office.
As a comparable measure rod for that, the same number of viewers represents the same number of your qualified match in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was a breakthrough among the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The appeal was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the last Friday play.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would be voting in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested with CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning receiving a meal depletion from demonstrators as he sought to take an elevator to the Judicial Committee hearing.
He was standing with his eyes about him for a few minutes while they were throwing him down, which was broadcast live on CNN.
I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
Someone told him, "You have the power and many women have very little power."
Blake said his office had issued a statement and said that, before the lift was closed, he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All of the cable and broadcasting networks were sometimes covering matters later, when the Judicial Committee was to put forward a vote to pass Kavanaugh's nomination for the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic elite wanted.
His conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, argued on Flake.
It was after a conversation with Coons and several senators later, that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice of power, because it became clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accuses his critics of engaging in political matches on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused taxpayers of her plans to leave the European Union of engaging in "political games" about Britain's future and taking national interest in interviewing the newspaper the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to the head of the leash on the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pushed forward his attack on his so-called Brexit plan, or Chequers' plan, saying the proposal would gather Britain and the European Union's tariffs as a “absolutely nonsense" proposal.
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrests the suspect Dyteon Simpson about the death of a LSU player
The police arrested suspiciously about the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested, and enrolled in prison for a second-grade murder cause, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fighting.
Police discovered the glasses from the scene and said they had received Simpson's DNA, as reported by WaFB, an affiliate of CBS.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said he confessed the fatal shooting of Wayde.
The bond was fixed to him at $350,000, reported by the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, in which it was said that a wound was shot in the head and into the neck of the cause of death.
The department is recognising the Louisiana State Police task force for refugees, the state police crime laboratory, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area for assistance with the investigation coming to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for “his commitment and determination to bring justice to justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot boot grew 6 inches up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne also played basketball with LSU.
Last season was an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that the team was “disturbed” and “disturbed” with the death of Wayne.
That's an issue," Wade said.
Ashes from a volcano are pushed past Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano has plummeted over southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexican people on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased into the crater, and registered 183 gas emissions and ashes over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring multiple motors and vibrations.
The images on social media showed that there were thin layers of ash coverage of the automotive windscreens in the areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics noted an increase in activity at the 45-mile (72-kilometre) volcano south-east of the capital since a 7.1-mile earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
There were clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between demonstrators for independence and riot police, with thousands taking part in competitive demonstrations to mark the one-year anniversary of Catalonia's split vote.
A group of pickpockets caught eggs and cast a powdered paint on the riot police behind them, creating dark shadows in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
There were also skimmings out in the day, with the police using their discipline to restrain the fight.
There were many people in favour of independence chanting “Forgotten, Forgiveness of any" just in front of unionist demonstrators shouting “Forgotten Spain."
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries in the demonstrations, reported by the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region where independence is found there is one year after the October 1 referendum which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose to be independent with a high majority, although the percentage that came out with a boycott was low among the majority against the split.
According to Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the vote at polling stations across the region with violent clashes.
They were in favour of independence following a demonstration on Friday night to support the national police.
The demonstration went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68-year-old, said an electrician attending the demonstration of separatists with his wife who no longer had the hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
We've seen one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying with wonder they could vote, but we're stuck now," he said.
Despite the fact that Catalan parties found in favour of independence a crucial victory if it were forced in last December's regional elections, they failed to maintain that continuity this year with many of their well-known leaders in exile either on their own or have been remanded in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the proclamation of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on the demonstration to support the police on his phone, said the conflict was curated by politicians from both sides.
The tension is rising endlessly," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders put in the car before his trial from the end of last year, announced that he would be competing in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
Compete as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the reversal of democratic values and the oppression of the Spanish government," he said.
City of Derry: Men were arrested after their home was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car accident in Derry City.
The event took place on the Corncrake of Ballytrades on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
A crossbow may also have been released with the car at some point.
Menga's score gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston was to save the win.
Livingston had an amazing and unexpected win over Rangers, and Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games was the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end with Gary Holt's team coming equal to Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's team without a win-win in the Premier League season as they face Hearts, and they have eight points to back them, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home against Rapid Wien in the Europa League next Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime adds his number of games to six games, while Holt's head coach still unbeaten since succeeding Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston doesn't score odds against bald visitors
Holt's team should be advanced long before they scored, and their method directly affected many difficulties for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the back but his attempt across the back's mouth, and then Alan Lithgow could only put his effort into getting after he slipped in to meet Craig Halkett's head across the back.
The home team was happy to allow Rangers to play in front of them, with the knowledge that they would damage the visitors away with the fixed items.
And that was how the back was scored.
Rangers gave a free kick and created Livingston a half chance, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga an opportunity, which removed the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in charge of the ball by that time, but failed to break the home team's defenders and Liam Kelly's barber,
That story continued in the second half, though Kelly had to save from Alfredo Morelos.
The door to Scott Pittman was closed by Alan Rangers McGregor's barber and Lithgow gave him a spot in the distance from another fixed item by Livingston.
Passes across the Livingston box have been continuously disrupted and cleaned up, and two ice chic claims have been rejected - after Halkett's challenge to substitute Glenn Middleton, and one on handle.
Unmistakable proof" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent proof and result for Livingston.
All of them had improved, overcoming their expectations that way upward.
Their playing style and personnel have changed little since they came back to the main section, but Holt has to be commended for how he has inspired the team since his arrival.
He had so much power.
The captain Halkett was excellent, overseeing the highly organized defenders, and Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have kept their records from beginning to end.
There was a shortage of motivation by Rangers.
Although they gave great proofs at times about Gerrard, they came back to a great extent to those standards.
The last pass was missing - they broke through the home team only once - and it's a kind of eye opener for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdogan's visit to Cologne.
A smile and blue skies were seen on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - designed to repair relations between NATO allies.
There have been a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then addressed Cologne to open a new massive mosque.
The largest Turkish population is found outside Turkey itself in that city.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the crowd from gathering 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The voice of hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan was also heard - many of them in Kurdish - as they sharply criticized Erdogan's policies and decided to welcome him to the country.
The objections are a reflection of the visitor's separation, being worshiped as a hero by some German Turquoise and being criticized harshly as autistic by others.
Road Crash in Deptford: Wheels die with a collision with a car
Wheels have died in a collision with an interior car in London.
The crash occurred close to the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a busy road in Deptford, south-west of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics attended the scene, but the man died there.
The crash comes several months after the death of another cyclist in an accident and flees on Childers Street, about one mile away from the foreseeable end of Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and get to know his immediate relatives.
There are closed roads and bus referrals, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Martin Prison: Six injured officers during an anarchist
Six prison officers have been injured during a confrontation at the men's high security car, the Prison Office said.
The anarchism took place at HMP Long Larkin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The "Tornado" specialist officers were introduced to combat the confrontation, involving eight prisoners and limited to one lateral.
The officers were treated for minor injuries against them at the scene.
The Prison Service spokesperson said: "The team of expert prisons has been deployed to tackle an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not accept the violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be put in front of the police and that they can put another distance into the car."
Long Lartin HMP has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the governor of the prison received medical treatment in the hospital after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And riot officials were called in last October to tackle a serious confrontation in which the team was attacked with pulverized balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood aims (which could be a benefit for under-drying areas)
A tropical depression rarely confronts Arizona, but that's likely to happen early next week with the remainder of Rosa's Hurricane energy pointing over the Southwest Desert, and flood-prone risks.
The National Weather Service issued tug-of-war watchdogs for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Pheonix on Tuesday, and will be heading towards Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix stated in a tweet that there were only “ten tropical cyclones that kept their tropical storm status or weakened within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center are projected to be 2 inches to 4 inches long, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogillon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the South West Desert will appear to be 1 to 2 inches including Central Rockies and The Great Basin, and may contain a cut-off total of up to 4 inches.
For those who are now out of the risk of tula, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing because there is drought in the region.
While flooding is a serious concern, some of that rain may be beneficial as some of the South West is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dryer Monitor, there is an intense drought in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second-highest category, "said weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa passes across the peninsula of Baja California of Mexico.
Rosa, which still has plenty of hurricanes on Sunday morning with maximum winds 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving northwards at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is reaching colder waters in the Pacific Ocean so it is losing power.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico at plenty of tropical storms in the evenings or Monday nights.
The rain across parts of Mexico may be severe, and there is a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California is expected to enter the northwest of Sonora, and it may have been 10 inches,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross northern Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main hazard expected from Rosa or its very heavy grave remains in California, Sonora north-east, and the South-West U.S. Desert, is “says the National Hurricane Centre.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening tugs and debris flows, and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted suicide
Three teenage boys were arrested and a 20-year-old suspected of murder following the discovery of a 16-year-old boy who had been stabbed several times in Somerset.
The boy was found in the teens injured in the Excelsior Terrace district of Midsomer Norton, about 4:00 BST Saturday.
It was taken to the hospital where it has a ‘consistent’ condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police say Avon and Somerset.
Officials are appealing to anyone who may have a mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that he ‘suffered, granularity, anger’ the Democratic Party
Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and scandalous tactics," Trump said.
Trump said Kavanaugh “has suffered the uglyness, and anger of the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his allegation.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw highs and quality and bravery" Kavanaugh that day.
A vote to certify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most capable legal intentions of our time, a jurist with a record of excellent public service," he told a crowd of West Virginia followers.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of voting in the mid-term elections.
• Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, and I'm really running," he said.
That's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates."
Trump has claimed that democrats are on a mission to “reject and block matters."
The first vote of procedure on the Seanad floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, GOP senior leadership consultant told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by the earthquake, Indonesian tsunamis and the number killed is increasing
At least 384 people were killed, and many people and large waves were swept by the crash of the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island, Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves crashed up to six metres (18 feet) on the shore falling by night, sweeping a lot of them to their death and destroying anything in their way.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the threat of the tsunami arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately and so they were killed,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, in a briefing session in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come by itself, it drew with cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” said Nugroho, saying that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the edgeboard.
Some people went up on trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palau.
Airports issued by the disaster agency show a lot of buildings and shops destroyed, complex bridges and broken bridges and a mosque and water around it.
They continued to follow God's commands.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday amounted to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb thrown on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long narrow harbour, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels fell.
Some victims were found stuck under the debris of fallen buildings, he said, and said 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palau, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake epidemic.
Nugroho said “there was absolutely no information in the messages” from Donggala.
There are about 300, 000 people living there,” said the Red Cross in a statement, saying her team and volunteers were on the way to the hit places.
“This is a tragedy already, but it could get bigger,” she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday because they did not give the information that the tsunami struck Palo, although officials said waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur piece on social media a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard as he was tormented warning them of the tsunami approaching the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes a water wall plugs into the shore, bringing with it buildings and cars.
The driver was not immediately able to open the door.
A major power cut was caused by the earthquake and tsunami that cut the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began to launch a cargo plane with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuations still require food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pale on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
It's all bad.
While the World Vision team from Donggala arrived safely to the city of Palau, where employees are sheltered in tarpaulin shelters created in the courtyard of their office, they went over destruction along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
“They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's all bad.
Even as aid groups began the relief work, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being blocked from travelling to Palu.
According to the Palu regulations, regulations, funding, procurement and staffing from abroad will not flow until a disaster location is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“But it remains a provincial level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “O.K is a national disaster,” we can open for international assistance but there is still no status.
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those who were still missing had the hope that their loved ones would become miracles that make natural disasters worse.
A small boy was taken out of the house.
On Sunday, rescuers released a free woman who had been stuck in debris for two days and her mother's body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national parallaring team coach, trained two of the parallarists missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi also said that some of his students were students of some of the others who were stranded at the Roa Hotel.
As a junior in the paraphylactic field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, in the hours following the spread of the news of the collapse of the Roa Hotel among the paraphylactic community, he sent a WhatsApp message to the competitors of Palu, who were taking part in the beach festival, as he stepped out of his power tree with concern.
But his messages resulted in only one grey tick, rather than a pair of blue ticks.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
A thief steals $26, 750 during an ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
A thief stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink worker who was refilling the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying ATMs in the entertainment centre and ready to deliver more money, written by Detective Dennis McCarthy in the issue.
When he was busy, another man ran from the back of Brink's employee and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw some suspicious leaving the immediate, according to the issue, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with knowledge of who they are should contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rap musician changes his name to Ye
It's called Kanye West.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
Ye's nickname on West, 41, has been for some time now and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
It will be on the show instead of Ariana Grande who canceled his arrival on the show for “emotional reasons,” the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West previously said the word was of religious importance to him.
I believe that "yes" is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year, when he was discussing the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
So I am you, I am you, I am we are.
It changed from Kayne, meaning the only person, to Ye - which is a direct reflection of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are."
It's one of a number of rap musicians to change their name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-worker, Jay-Z performed without a hyphen and without big letters as well.
The U.S. military is not allowed to use civilian weapons
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that he will never use a military force against a civilian as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
Troops released a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooting across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said it was due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities that young people are attracted to criminals.
A.I. funding should be increased.
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double what it spends on research in this field, said researcher and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make AI ads, even if the U.S. does not have a complete formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be ranked 1st in AI innovation by 2030.
It would be a good start to double-up an AI research budget, taking into account that every other country is far beyond the US, and we are looking for the next AI discovery," Lee said.
By doubling the funding the chances for the next major AI discovery in the US would also be increased twice, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face+.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that was won by the highest ranking American Othello player, and later served as the executive of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Defence Projects Agency Robotic Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visions.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants," Lee said.
China is not taking away the academic leaders; but the corporate companies,” Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years are employed by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. to boost AI efforts as well.
I think a green card should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," Lee said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Science provides funding to people at academic institutions such as how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department established an Artificial Intelligence Joint Centre, which has partners from industry and academia to participate in, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, he is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
In the meantime, no action has been seen in the past months in U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
The Macedonian vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether or not to change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia,” a deal that would settle a dispute that has been going on for decades with Greece that banned their bids for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbours represents a demand for its territory and banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
Both governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not be voting in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the number of people voting will reach the 50 percent required so that the referendum is valid.
The question of the referendum was as follows: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership to accept the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is well worth it to watch entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that have come from the fall of Yugoslavia.
I came today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union as it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijeska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not binding to the law, many members of the parliament said they will adhere to the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, voting reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
I came out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote for the Macedonian referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September, 2018 to change the country's name to pave the way for her to take part in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and was drawing up chairs in front of a tent built by the people who boycott the referendum.
We are not in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with pride, and not through the service door" Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO's membership will provide a much-needed investment for Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I believe that a very large majority will favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a vote would be “in favour of” as a “declaration of our future.
In a poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters took part in the referendum - below the voter turnout required.
In another poll, conducted by the Macedonian Telma Television, 57 of the respondents were found to vote on Sunday.
At the same time, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, one vote must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The referendum would be the first serious blow to Western government policy since it took over in May last year.
Sergio Aguero Manchester City makes his way through all of Brighton's defenders for the back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling put Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win in Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy to get around in 65 minutes.
The car was parked at the front of the park.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open field.
There were four green shirts around Augero then.
He pushed about one defender before running over a few other defenders on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then turned to his side, reaching for Sterling.
The English front used his first touch in the box to bring the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to win the Brighton goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan to beat in on the right side of the grid.
Augero has some problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about putting it playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have scored a goal at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Main League's clamp.
This was completed in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's land on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before leading Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues's boot hit the ball into the grid before it crashed across a border.
City against Hoffenheim will play in the Champions League group at 1255 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer spoiler wants to play for Rockies
With the nationalists out of the competition of the casting game, there was little reason to force another start.
But Scherzer who constantly has a competitive desire to take the tumult on Sunday against Colorado Rockies hopes, but if there's a casting match implications for the Rockies alone, which is ahead of one game over WL West.
The Rockies won a special place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to win a title in the first division.
While we are playing unwarranted, at least we will be able to put our foot in the three-game series knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I would be facing this year.
Why wouldn't we want to take part in that?"
The Nazis still have a starter to announce for Saturday, but it is said that they allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation normally.
Scherzer, who would be doing his 34th, would have spent a week on Thursday's practice-place session and would be pitching on his usual Sunday break.
The Washington dew is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 endings in 220 2/3 acents this season.
Trump in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the case for his choice in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of a ballot in the mid-term elections.
• Everything we have done will be at risk in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things - I'm not running but I'm really running and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump then said, “You see this ugly, ugly radical group, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to return the power by using all necessary means, you see the granularity, the aura.
They do not mind who they will hurt, who they will lay down to gain power and control, that is what they want, power and control, we will not give them that."
The Democrats have a mission to “reject and block matters."
And you see that in the last four days,' he said, “the Democrats are angry and angry and detestable and false.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee classifying Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Democrats with his name, which led to a high level of surveillance by the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you get the document?
Oh, uh, what is it.
No, no, I'm waiting for one - that body signaling was all bad - the worst body signaling I've ever seen."
The Labour Party and the Church are no more.
They don't accept those who speak out.
While the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in the line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome - that's all because we spoke out.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated almost the same because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the resolution criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, questions, ironically, that Jeremy had previously disagreed with leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that was exactly how the CG held its Friday meetings.
Sad today, that is not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the promise of a “more kind, gentler” has long since been forgotten if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of a different perspective in the Labour party and every opinion is considered whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party or not.
That began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues I had previously thought we had a similar political view that we would take fundamental change and positions that I would never agree with - whether on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and whatever I say - there will be a huge amount of abuse on social media calling for de-election, criticizing central politics, telling me I shouldn't be a Labour party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more than a few of my colleagues because the comments I'm usually focused on are political matters.
I am overwhelmed by the professionalism and professionalism of those colleagues who have to endure a sexual or racial illness every day without a backlash.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of illiteracy are now being taken.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour's party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer that broad church and with all “infidel” resolutions or changes in selection rules the party is becoming narrower.
For the past two years I have been advised not to draw attention to myself, not to speak out as much as then I would be “okay, all right.
But I didn't go to politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, which was inspired by Thatcher's neglect of the government which led my comprehensive school classroom to fall to the ground, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I've never been to the polls, including the last one.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy stance and areas I disagree with in relation to current leadership.
For those who have put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is facing Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
But in reality my message is not just about Nottingham Momentum, but it's about my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve them and I promise that opt-outs or political practice won't stop me acting in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes unannounced to the top
The final result may have been two slow runners on subject knives, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this highly entertaining Chief Tennants game this day.
They are at the top of the table now, the only team out of ten teams that have not been won.
In the end, his defense was excellent, as well as how they took chances, who helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
We have been tried over our games so far, but we have not yet won, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Our recommendation to Ayr, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's in the 14th minute, who rescued Frazier Climo, Ayr, but, due to a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who released Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the nets and take Jason Baggot on that impoverished.
Climo initially stretched Ayr with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, scored and then rescued from foot to foot to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began the second half well and with the help of Patrick Anderson, who rescued Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaidh Knott, who was brought off the pitch on an stretcher, and from the resumption, Ayr pushed forward further through the rescue of Climo's Stafford McDowall.
Ayr Blair Macpherson's acting captain then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose led the extra man to pay for it with Bruce Colvine's inhabitant at the end of a spell of fierce pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Stroan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, since the penalty kick was stretched out, MacPherson landed at the back of a moving Ayr cage.
Climo, as he had been doing since almost restarting, after Kyle Rowe picked up a high kick over David Armstrong's shoulder and put down the backseat Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth.
Still Game star appears to be going with a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be moving to the hospitality industry after discovering that he was nominated as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford's 56-year-old role as Jack Jarvis is on the popular BBC show, a show he has written with long-time comedian Greg Hemphill and co-stars with.
The two announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the last during the show, and it looks like Kieran is planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official records lists, the director is Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make a statement about the situation, although a source from the Scottish Sun gave a node that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the “successful restaurant trade” of Glasgow.
‘Ours is the sea': Bolivia is landlocked hoping that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a naval headquarters equipped with rigs in La Paz.
An ocean blue flag is flown on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are smeared with the slogan: “Ours is the sea right away.
It is a duty to get it back."
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of its coastlines lost against Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century remains clean - as well as the desire to launch the Pacific Ocean again.
This hope is the greatest hope of decades, with Bolivia awaiting ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after a five-year discussion.
Bolivia has momentum, unity spirit and tranquility, and of course she expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be looking at the CFP control on large screens across the country, with the confidence that the bench in The Hague will favour Bolivia's claim - following turbulent talks over the past decades - that Chile has a duty to negotiate and bring a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the attractive indigenous president of Bolivia - facing a controversial battle for re-election next year - is also heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
We are very close to going back to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and if it is decided in her favor there will be little change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the Chilean territory, and ordered that it not determine the outcome of potential talks.
Given that the CFP ruling comes exactly six months after listening to the final arguments indicates that “the case was not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the cause of Bolivia has not only been put forward, but may have been reversed in the past four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken possession of the issue of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive aggressive aggressive aggressiveness made good use of any remaining will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold a discussion later on.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was more rapid than it usually is.
Chile will be given a “great opportunity to open up a new era of relations with Chile” on Monday and a chance to “end up conflicts of 139 years with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most beloved Latin American presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political support.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The control is an opportunity to see that we must overcome history."
North Korea said nuclear disarmament will not happen if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it is trusted in Washington.
He spoke at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to take action according to its statement on the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the opponents.
The U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is set to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “dream” that continuous sanctions and a refusal by the U.S. to declare an end to the North Korean War would never leave.
Washington is under agreement with the declaration if Pyongyang does not take the first significant measures of disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is in fact in the process of rejecting an arsenal that is likely to see the country as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show also showcases the latest line in massive headgear that is on the way to Main Street near you
If you want to make your collection of hats more or completely block the sun you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a huge range of headgears for their SS19 collection on the display platform with the effect of the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
A lot of very impractical hats were being shown throughout Instagram this summer and those designers put their incredible works on the manic platform.
In the prominent piece with Valentino there is an over-the-top polite hat which has a wide leaf like feathers that swallowed the head of the minks.
Other huge accessories included water melons that had jewelry, a magician's hat and even pineapple - but are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne also revealed a strange mask selection - in time for November.
A lot of the colored masks were sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than with haute couture.
One work was like scuba diving equipment, snorkeling and swimming glasses, while others were like a molten ice cream cone.
And if you follow the huge statement - you're lucky.
It is predicted by stylistic observers that the destructive big bonnets are making their way to the major streets near you.
The huge hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide leaf that everyone saw from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat displayed across social media put another large work on the manic - a straw beach bag that is almost as large as the manicure that carries it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, consisting of raffia French dressing and white leather straps, was the prominent piece in the collection of SS19 Jacquemus' La Riviera Fashion Paris.
Luke Armitage's famous style told FFG: “I expect big beach hats and bags to come to the mainland next summer - since the designer had so much influence it would be difficult to ignore the huge accessories.
John Edward: Language skills necessary for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a further series of outstanding examination results, which is reinforced by the success of individuals and everyone together in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30, 000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, the profession they choose and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that we can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages are gaining popularity and become a preferred subject of aspiration in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to build relationships with people from other countries and trust them.
From the latest exam results this year, we see that languages are on top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages earned A grade A Honours.
The data collected from 74 SCIS membership schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved Grade A Honours in Mandarin, while 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish Grade A as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as a matter of choice, as observed on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With languages required for more potential job opportunities, these skills are essential in the world of mobility.
Regardless of the profession one would choose, if they have learned a second language in the future, they will have a real benefit that they have a lifelong skill similar to this skill.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a multilingual person will be automatically promoted to competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4, 000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language of a dual-digital percentage of them, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today's children to invest in language teaching.
If children have more than one language, especially those in developing economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
Different languages will be taught in each school within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on the most classic contemporary languages, while others will teach the languages considered to be the most important languages for the UK watching until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with a teaching team who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment for children to prepare and equip them with the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global business environment, that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, languages like “international communication skills” should actually be viewed as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
It's a beautiful sight to watch.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game on Sunday in San Diego.
LeBron James is set to make his debut in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes it will play is still to be decided.
It will be more than one minute and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited moment.
Following an earlier exercise this week, James was asked about his plans with a six-week pre-season schedule of Lakers".
“There are no pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, You Tube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of rallying around Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five mobilizations during the coming week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to keep the person he chose for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to get support for the mid-term elections because Republicans are at risk of losing their control in the Federal Parliament, when votes are cast on November 2.
What time will be Virginia's West Trump rally going on tonight and how can it be viewed online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's campaign can be watched live online on You Tube.
Trump is more likely to talk about the hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearing was tense about allegations of sexual misconduct. The Senate's vote has been postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main aim of the upcoming week's series of rallies is to help Republicans, who are facing intense competitions, speed up their campaign.
So, President Trump's campaign expressed that these five mobilizations over the coming week focused on “incentivising the volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their achievements in the Senate and the House of Commons,” according to Reuters.
Congress has so much control over its program that the president visits as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season unfolds," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
The night's rally is set to be held at Wesbanco's Arena in Wheeling and may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get publicity from the media in Pittsburgh,” according to Metro News, western Virginia.
Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the past month.
Trump wants to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President is coming to try to boost the polls" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 USA Team shows their desire to be optimistic before the Sunday singles rounds.
After three one-on-one sessions, the game of Saturday may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a sports concept made up, but the players strongly believe in it, especially at competitions like this.
So, where are they now?
They were six points ahead and now it's reduced to four points, so we have a little bit of momentum, which I would say" Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe, of course, has four points ahead and twelve still to play.
The Americans, however, are optimistic and have a lot of hope, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, throughout the day and can argue that they won three points out of four.
Spieth is playing great from the house to the lawn and is giving a good example.
The scornful cry of the celebration got louder as the round went on; he discovered a necessary hits to win a game of four, when he and Thomas were two to an end after two holes.
The hits he received won the game at 15 and the shouts were let down, the kind that tells you that the American team has not lost the tournament.
You have to keep your courage and focus on your own game" said Spieth.
That's what's left of everyone now.
18 to leave.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the past two days are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of the Ryder Cup.
Four out of four Europeans have won, which is odd but happy and can't do anything that's wrong.
Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't hit the boots on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided booting, Saturday mornings, Friday evenings and the second nine hole on Friday mornings.
The game they played and how they get energy from the loudest audience shows that the two of them are the players who have to win on Sunday; and no player would be more enchanted to win a European victory under the sun at Le Golf National or Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if they both won the win at the same time, but at different holes.
But it's too early to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to win Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four balls, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spanish and Swedish were stuck in a hole and couldn't escape from it after having had two dolls and two doubles in the front nine holes.
However, there is no one to help you escape from a hole you are stuck in.
The four balls and the four game are so attractive, if closely observed, because of the interaction between the two, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way in which a strategy in the blink of an eye changes.
Europe has played better as a team to this point and they are well ahead of the final day, but this four game showed a desire to fight for the U.S. Team, although some people, especially in the United States, had doubts.
Europe is ahead 10-6 at the beginning of the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage at the beginning of the last day of the Ryder Cup after the four balls and the game, when they dominated the United States 10-6.
The two exciting, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, dominated the conflict when they had two wins on Tiger Woods, who were struggling, to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who wanted to win the Cup, lost to Hazeltine two years ago, faced a failing American team, in the four balls, which left the league at 3-1.
The American team had a lot of resilience in the four balls; they won two games but were unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European golfer to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, who was baptised after a super weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the four games that began in Ryder Cup history.
Both Woods and Patrick Reed had a big win in the four balls and both played as a unit to win a victory over Woods, who was desperate, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods who was struggling in two games on Saturday, has shown a lot of play now and again but he has lost 19 out of 29 games, which he played, now in the four balls and in the four games and has now lost seven consecutive games.
Justin Rose took a break when the four balls took place this morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four games and won 2 and 1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are counted as the world's first golfer and third golfer.
However, in a pleasant day, Europe was not easy to get south west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the main tournaments three times, and Justin Thomas, laid the standard down for the Americans when they won two points on Saturday.
They earned their convincing victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to victory over Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four balls, although they lost the first two holes.
It only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team came back from a four-point deficit in the single tournament, although the Furyk team only need to be on a score to keep the Cup, because they won the Cup last year.
After being in second place for two days, however, they are unlikely to be able to counter-attack on Sundays.
North Koreans say there is no ‘prone' chance of unilateral disarmament due to lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that there were ongoing sanctions that were exacerbating their lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way that the country would unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea showed “very good goodwill throughout the past year, in that it halted nuclear trials and missile trials, took the place of nuclear trials in a row and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and technology.
But, we don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
• Without trust in the United States, our national security will not be trusted and in these circumstances, there is no way that we will, first of all, unarmed."
While North Korea's common complaints against the United States, which progressively opposed a “promising” approach to nuclear disarmament, which allowed North Korea, as it took small steps, seemed important in its statement that it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. President-in-office summit, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work “to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons in advance.
Washington has also opposed applications to ease severe international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists that “nuclear disarmament will initially be done” and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve their aim in a coercive manner, and even counters “the passing of war notice”, said Ri.
The idea that sanctions can defeat us is to think from people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that sanctions, which are continuing, are contributing to our lack of trust.
There was no mention of another summit between Kim and Trump, mentioned by the American leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and also said: “If South Korea other than the United States were the party involved in this issue of nuclear disarmament, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be in place like this.”
However, the way in which Ri spoke in his speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea rockets would be targeted to the U.S. mainland after Trump, "Mr Evil President," "rocket man", called Kim a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN, Trump praised Kim for his courage to take steps to de-arm, although he threatened last year to “completely destroy” North Korea. However, he said that much work still needs to be done and the sanctions would be maintained until North Korea de-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not intend a certain time for disarmament, saying, “if it takes two, three or five years - no matter about it.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State with the UN Security Council on Thursday, said: “The Security Council sanctions would have to be enforced robustly and without any failure until nuclear disarmament was fully realized and confirmed.
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the month that was to come to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit he made wasn't too successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, stating that progress had been made; but North Korea criticized him within a few hours because he “made claims as if a fraudster would do.”
North Korea in a meeting with Moon this month promised to destroy the scene of a missile, if the United States would take “responsive measures.”
Kim told him that his "responsive measures" were the security promises Trump had made in Singapore and taking steps to achieve a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University has begun this year to encourage all undergraduates to sleep more and more with a growing culture of study through the night with the help of caffeine.
A student found out that students in the university, who are in the first place in the world, have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, compiled the course.He believes this course is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after talking about the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why hasn't this been told to me before, while I was in my senior year?'
She said no one had already told her about the importance of sleep - something that surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time this year, explains to students the key points of good sleep habits and how they help with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university took the decision to introduce the course, when it found that students lacked sleep during the week.
A series of interactive tasks is part of the hour course.
In one section, there is an image of dormitories, in which students knock on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to get a response to the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects the functioning of athleticism and the importance of routine at bedtime.
In another section, people who take part are told how long-term lack of sleep, the increased risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer can occur.
Then a map of the campus with interactive icons, prompts the people who take part to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to be informed--as you would have the right to know about the health effects of smoking on you," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride of ‘waiting for you to sit during the night,' he said. It means modern technology and the pressure on students, who are constantly increasing the lack of sleep as a growing problem.
A student should ensure that he has enough good quality sleep as a ‘secret tool’, he said, to avoid stress, tripping and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as a lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of hunger, as he is regularly hungry.
Raymond So, 19 years, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said he opened his eyes and looked at the whole thing.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all undergraduates to do a similar study program, before joining the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at waking time and be aware of the negative effects of ‘blue light’ coming from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's back wins on Gerrard's men
Rangers lost their home because, due to the defeat of Menga, Steven Gerrard 1-0's offensive team was defeated at Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted the first win out of home, since they won 4-1 at St. Johnstone in February. But Gary Holt's team won them, the second defeat of Gerrard out of 18 games as manager. Consequently, Gerrard's team is eight points ahead of Hearts, the heavily dominated team in Premiership Ladbrokes.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no apparent success with Rangers, who lacked inspiration, being on a scoreboard.
As long as Rangers have fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and the backs are only a difference between them.
Rangers, after the lineman, Calum Spence, may face further trouble in getting treatment for an injury in the head from some content thrown away, apparently.
Gerrard made eight changes to the winning team on Ayr to get a place in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt kept the same 11 players, who took a point from Hearts the previous week and would be delighted with the way in which his well-trained team adhered to the opponent.
Rangers may have had possession of the ball for the most part but Livingston was more concerned with the possession they acquired.
Livingston should have received a score after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who took a kick towards the back of Allan McGregor but went on a forage.
Keegan took Jacobs free-kick who went to captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow didn't get along with his chic but put him on a foreground.
Rangers took control of the game, but seemed to have had hope rather than belief in the type of play they were playing, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he deserved an ice kick after a quarter of an hour, when he met Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson did not accept Columbia's man's petition.
Rangers managed to put only two kicks towards the back but former goalkeeper Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no difficulty in defeating Lassana Coulibaly's headband and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although there may have been a Livi kick in the 34th minute against the patron of the game, it cannot be denied that they did not deserve it because they had made a great effort.
Once again Rangers failed to deal with a fixed item in the boot from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not answer your passport from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave a pass to Menga, who put it in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change had an immediate impact as he sent a pass to Morelos, who hit him towards the back but Kelly, who had a super match, rushed from his line to overcome the ball.
But Livingston continued to attract the visitors to play the kind of game they liked. Lithgow and Halkett continued to hit the ball up the pitch several times.
Holt's team could have an extra score towards the end of the game but McGregor stood up well to overcome Jacobs and gave Lithgow a blow from a corner that went on foal.
Rangers' representative, Glenn Middleton, had a late claim to an ice hockey when he had a confrontation with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, looked in the opposite direction.
Almanag: A certain originator of Geiger.
And now a page from our Almanag “Sunday Morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today......the day of future physics was born, Johannes Wilhelm, “Hans” Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of finding and measuring radioactivity, a discovery from which the device known as Geiger Enumerator was made.
In the 1950s, a film starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans was made a cornerstone of science. Although not expected, they became scientists in the film:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It is a Geiger Reckoner, used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can peel the effects of the atoms that occur as a result of the distortion released from the minerals."
Evans: “Yes, it's definitely crumbling now!”
Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the name is still there.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' pirate cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' pirate cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize pirate cells as part of medical treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘see' protein that is common in many cancers and then undergo recurrence.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients, who have different types of cancer.
For one woman who received treatment with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system how to identify pirate cells, the whole ovarian cancer disappeared for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see' protein, which is common in many types of cancer, and is called HER2 and then reincarnation of the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.
•“Some types of cancer grow” due to HER2, among them breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and colorectal cancers, explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from patients and “teaching” worked on how to target cancer cells to treat a certain type of leukemia.

Kanye West was hit in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving a release exhibit in which he proposed the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for office in 2020, according to him.
When he sang the third song called Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat. He began to complain against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I speak as often as a bright person who says: 1. How could you love Trump, isn't he racist?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America twice," he said.
SNL began the show with a muffled sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Holywood star joked about Brett Kavanagh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee over allegations of sexual assault, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
While it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded Kanye West's clamp on social media.
It's not clear if he wanted to go to the West.
Also, the audience had complained that he was being tormented by the backstage in relation to the headgear he was wearing.
• They beat me in the backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on you.'
They've hit me!
And then, they say I am in a low place,” according to the Washington Examiner.
West followed him: “Do you want to see the low place?” He said “put it on superman's cab as that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
He was beaten at least twice because of what he said and it seemed that there were certain staff, §§§§ reported by Variety; one person told the magazine; “The studio was all quiet.
The show was called West as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former host, rap musician Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West combined many people with an exhibition of the song ‘I Love It’ dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
The head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner supported West in a tweet: “For one of the most courageous figures: Thank you for standing up against the daoist crowd."
But a talk show presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that Kanye West was “as it is and that is all great.
But I choose not to compensate someone (buying his music or supporting his “artist” who, I think, is embracing and publishing an ideology that harms my own community.
It's free.
We, too, are “sise.
Before the show, the rap musician announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying his official name now was Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's example, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, as well.
His rap fellow musician Snoop Dog has the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the famous musician, Prince, changed his name to symbolIl and then to the artist who was already known as Prince.
A charge of attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast.
A forty-five-year-old man was charged with attempted murder, when a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Hacamar Town, which was announced by police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the District Court in Belfast on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will examine the charges.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, attacks poison masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress criticized the stereotypes of the manure hero, saying that such on-screen parts mean that young boys often think they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to ‘Sunday Times Culture’, Kit said he believes something has become wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of poison masculinity in the era of ♯MeToo.
Kit, his 31-year-old co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, has recently admitted that he feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
‘In person, I feel strongly at the moment - where did we stray with masculinity?' he said.
What did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?'
Kit believes that TV may be responsible, to a point, for the increase in poison masculinity, thanks to the extremely generous characters.
He continued: "What is indigenous and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, it informs young boys that they need to be sure before they get up.
I think that's one of the big questions of the day - how do we change that?
It is clear that something has become wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in a preliminary or follow-up story, when the series ends next summer, saying ‘there are no more battlefields and horses from him’.
From November, Kit will play a major part in the revival of True West Sam Shepard. This is the story of a film producer and the story of his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently expressed his belief that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
‘I met my wife on this show and, therefore, he gave me my family and my future life,' he said.
Rose participated Ygritte, who was in love with the character of Kit, Jon Snow in the fantasy series, which won an Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Received Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease is in excess of 820,000 in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were announced in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were spread through sex, a change from the existing story.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through part of China, due to infection blood transfusion.
But there is a huge decrease in the number of people who get HIV like this and, hardly anyone is getting it like this right now, Chinese medical officials said in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the people with HIV and AIDS have increased by 100,000.
It is a tricky issue in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community of China spreading HIV through sex.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
According to the country's conservative values, studies show that 70%-90% of men, who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
Many of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is deficient in these relationships.
From 2003 onwards, the Chinese government promised to have full availability of HIV medication to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP senators have been leaked by a team member and condemns ‘dangerous lies and conspiracy theories’.
Rep. Maxine Waters has criticised allegations on Saturday that a member of her own team leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the member of staff posted the information on the Wikipedia pages of legal makers.
The Los Angeles Democrat pointed out that the information was being promoted by commentators from the ‘real-right' and websites.
• Lies, lies and more ugly lies” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch both of whom are from Utah were reported to have home addresses and phone numbers.
The information was posted online by an unknown person on Capitol Hill while examining allegations of sexual misconduct attributed to the person named for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leak was provided sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified the source of the posts involved in the Waters office and that the information regarding a member of the Waters team reported by the Hill.
“This allegation is entirely false,” followed Waters.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security has been provided as a result of these allegations, which are fraudulent and false - has not been responsible in any way for the leaks of this information.
This unsubstantiated allegation is entirely false."
A Waters statement was immediately criticized online. Among those who criticized her was a former press secretary in the White House, Ari Fleischer.
“This disclaimer is angry,” wrote Fleischer.
This implies that she does not have a suitable mindset to be a member of the Congress.
When something is attributed to someone who has not done it, it should not be angered.
It should not be challenging.
It should not question the reasons of the accused.
He needs to be calm and calm.
It seemed as if Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to Democratic condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate standing in the election to win Waters' seat in the mid-term elections; he also expressed his views on Twitter.
It's a big thing, if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office “ briefed the appropriate authorities and law agencies on the claims.
“We will ensure that the guilty are disclosed,” she continued, “and that they will be responsible for their actions, which are debatable and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Johnny English is in business again - a parody of Rowan Atkinson's episode with little effect.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new British-prone film and it appears that this revival is about the Johnny English franchise, which involves a parody of action in comic form. It began in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the language be self-sacrifice in the plug, in terms of how terrible we are, as a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English has once again obtained a license with the bulging eyes to mess up courses. Its name indicates that it is a comic character created for those who attend the cinema in the non-English-speaking countries.
It is, of course, the rising secret agent, who thinks it's tempting, but similar to Closeau, a combination of Mr Bean and the one who provided a note for the Chariots of Fire theme at the London Olympics opening ceremony in 2012.
It's based from the beginning on the traveler and the international man, mysterious to whom Atkinson took the part in Barclaycard's television adverts at a time, but now forgotten in which he left everything in his trance.
There are a few good points in this film, the latest J.E.
I enjoyed Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter while dressed in the medieval knight's armour and the rotors are hitting his helmet at one point.
Atkinson's victory for the physical comedy is evident, but the comedy is truly weak and excessive, in particular, because film brands such as James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer humor as part of the films.
It looks like the comedy is aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's quickest mishap is not as original and focused as the comedy is in the form of Mr Bean in Atkinson's unsound films.
The problem now is that there is a big problem.
A cyber-hacker has slipped into the secret network of British spies and has leaked the names of British agents. This makes the agent on duty very slightly disheartened, unfortunately, for Kevin Eldon.
It's a disaster for a prime minister, a serious person, who's already under pressure; it's a complete failure for the community: Emma Thompson strives for the character, who is similar to Teresa-May, but not much can be done with the script.
Her advisers inform her that each spy's name has been leaked and that she needs to find someone, who has resigned.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He is currently employed in a fancy place, but he is giving classes, in a confidential manner, about how to be a secret activist. Some comedy here as an English language offering is to provide a Rock Music-type spin-off academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets again with his old partner, Bough, who is again taking part in Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a commander of a submarine, a small meridian part, which is an excess of Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, who get everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back acting.They meet Ophelia Bulletova, a beautiful, beautiful woman, whose part is taken by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is overwhelmed by attracting tech billionaires who claim he can solve Britain's computer problems. Jason Volta is a malicious person and Jake Lacy takes the part.
English and Bough begin an absurd journey of pledging: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant by fire; they create a striking pole as they board Volta yacht, secretly; English creates an anarchism, when it attempts to use Virtual Reality heads to familiarize themselves with the interior of Volta's house.
They do their best for the final item, but while it is satisfying and lively, the children's TV looks like the whole thing.
It's quite a subject matter.
And as it is with other Johnny English ld films, I ran the idea: can the British film industry join Rowan Atkinson, who fits in his capacity?
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a four-day working week for British workers but that they will have pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which British will work for four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the bodies to donate money, which they will save through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI), to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The workers would have three days' weekend - but they would still have the same pay.
Sources said that the idea for the party's economic program and their plans to change the country in favour of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions has agreed with the four-day working week as a means for the workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: ‘A review of policy is expected before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal, suited to the party's approach to giving the worker an advantage and the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with this idea, because the Green Party has given four working weeks during the 2017 General Election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not currently agree with the goal.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: ‘The party's policy is not a four-day working week and the party is not being considered.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference to show his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to build power from ‘unnamed directors’ and ‘profit makers’ by utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in the water bodies will not receive their full share as the Labour government could take ‘deductions', as something was out of fashion.
He also confirmed plans to give places to workers on body boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds and give 10 per cent of the shares in the body to employees, who have a chance to receive annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, says with “60 Minutes” whether or not the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court, due to the FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, has been delayed by at least a week. It raises the question of the bureau's decision and whether Republican senators could change their mind and deprive the Judge of support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday on “60 Minutes” Scott Pelley's correspondent of Republican Senators, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could get any information they would change their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
As I enter the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this thing happened, after the allegation came out and asked him: ‘Did you do it?’
He was firm, determined, did not put a tooth in it."
However, it seems that Graham's vote is certain.
I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and he would take a serious allegation, he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it strongly,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And not everyone who nominated her can ensure it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual event, involving leading stars and an extremely important mission, as well: ending global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the Global Citizen Festival and thousands of people will be drawing on the Big Green in Central Park to enjoy musicians like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to highlight the definite aim of the event, that is, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival is an international advocacy, which seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting hard against it.
To get free tickets for the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket) concertgoers had to perform a number of tasks, or “acts” such as volunteer work, email a world leader, make a phone call or use any other sound way to spread information about their aim of ending poverty.
How successful was the World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it a real way to give people a free concert to encourage them to act, or is it just another example of a “click” - people think they are making a real difference when they sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who want to advance different goals.
He says these actions have helped to urge global leaders to make commitments and promote policies worth over $37 billion to impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money already received had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the globe.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and people who implement commitments, is based in the UK. It is committed to helping children develop their resources, in line with their capabilities" and pledges to provide $35 million in total to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice that is in malnutrition" said Tracy Ullman, the Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, to the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken, that called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced a fund for projects, the Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children to intervene about nutrition.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, the question “why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: “There will be a long, difficult road ahead of us - from time to time, we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and anti-discrimination ahead, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
This year's event will include musicians, in New York, Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Moane, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to run a “submission” to block Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can use the Navy “if necessary” to stop Russian energy being on sale in the markets, including the Middle East, according to the U.S. Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke, as stated in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's conduct in Syria, where it is operating with an invitation from a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to settle for energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the open sea lanes are maintained, and if necessary, to hold a blockade, to ensure that their energy is not available in the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the people present at the event, hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance.The Alliance is a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, to have an impact on and change fuels" he said.
The statements come as the Trump government is on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump, try to encourage Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that is "unappropriate" and, according to Trump, made Moscow's " hostage" of Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the Nord Stream 2 hose is one economic project with a cost of $11. It will increase the pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes it, due to economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we agree on the opinion that fuel cannot be used as a tool to push and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after his meeting with the US Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
A response from Germany to the US position has been confirmed by Germany that it will continue the project.
The main organization of the German industry, the German Industrial Federation (CTG) has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Federation (CTG) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Russia, President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider competing for the Presidency in 2020, according to the Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “very carefully” look at competing for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During her meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider competing.
It is time for women to go to Washington to properly include the broken government and then there is a woman in charge,” she said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will carefully consider competing for the presidency."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
I am deeply concerned about Donald Trump's effect on our democracy," she said.
Warren Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, have been openly condemned.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “we certainly need an FBI audit before we vote.”
A poll issued on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's voting area think she shouldn't compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll conducted by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Three of his supporters supported him in the election.
The poll showed that the former governor, Dev Patrick, had more support. 38 per cent supported him to stand and 48% were against him.
Democrats, who were in the public debate on a position for the presidency in 2020, included former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (NSI), which is by Track Palin, mobilizing for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted in September.
The police arrested him on Monday night and accused him of domestic violence.
My own son has been suffering since his return and I can understand the difficulties that other families face when it comes to Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. I understand the injury experienced by returning soldiers as they get sick," she told the audience mobilizing for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said “what no one wants to talk about” about her arrest and she said about her son and other former war soldiers, “they come back and they are different, they are hard, they come back and they doubt whether the community appreciates what their fellow soldiers and fellow soldiers and all other members of the army have done for their home country, what they have done for their country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence assault on a woman, for interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which refuses to give asylum to victims, who are fleeing gang-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and district complained in a court friend's brief on Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker, who was facing the challenges of the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff was not mentioned in the lawsuit, Grace against Sessions, initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
She said her party “and her violent son who is members of a gang,” abused her but U.S. officials refused to accept her application for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys, who were supporting Grace, said El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom seek asylum in the United States, were nations that had widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District Attorney General of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "disappears to decades of state law, federal law, and international law."
According to federal law, all claims for asylum must be assessed on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and the current ban on that principle, "said the brief of the friend of the court.
Solicitors made further arguments that the policy, which banned immigrants, had harmed the U.S. economy; they said there was a greater opportunity for them to become entrepreneurs and to “provide a necessary workforce.”
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered an asylum judge not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their home countries due to harassment or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on 11 June.
It was never intended that asylum would solve all problems - even all serious problems - that people face day-to-day around the world.
Despite the strong efforts made in Palu, the number of dead increases twice in the existing race to reach survivors.
The story was becoming more terrible for people who survived.
I feel the tension,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her little boy, who had a fever, at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, which had been burned to the ground.
• Every minute a body car is introduced.
Water is scarce."
Soldiers were seen returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, as they were marrying through drowned personal belongings; they wanted to save anything, which was available.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed from the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to cope.
Some of the injured people, including Dwi Harris, whose back and shoulders were broken, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital where patients were being treated, because powerful former vibrations were still following.
The tears were with him as he spoke about the terrible earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to protect ourselves.
I think," Harris told the Associated Press, explaining that his family was in town for marriage.
I heard my wife shout for help, but then everything was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are safe and secure."
The U.S. ambassador adds bullying to China's ‘promotional ads.
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page notice in a daily newspaper in the United States, the U.S. ambassador to China attributed Beijing to China that China was using American newspapers to expand propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - that China paid for - after accusing China of trying to interfere with the elections of the conference on November 6. China denies the charge.
Trump's accusation revealed that Beijing was trying to disrupt the U.S. elections a new step in a campaign, which is being scaled up by Washington to put pressure on China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Although it is common for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are stuck in a growing trade war, which, at present, has placed tariffs on both their imports.
China sent countermeasures tariffs early in the trade war to beat states like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, who exports dozens of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers, and businesses.
China is “using this bullying by placing advertising ads in free American newspapers” which Branstad wrote in an article that reflected his views in the Sunday newspaper of the Des Moines Register.
The Chinese government is using the American tradition that we have the right to speak and freedom to spread its propaganda, when it sends advertisements, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
In contrast, you will not hear many voices at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing.You will not see the various views the Chinese public may have regarding China's economic policy, which is shocking, since the media is under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He continued: “avoid one of China's major newspapers to publish its article,” though he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans taking women's voters from a door before the mid-term elections with Kavanaugh's case, according to Analysts.
As many prominent Republicans stand aside defending a nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, despite some allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a response, especially from women during the mid-term elections, will be in the pipeline.
People are very excited about this and most Republicans have already said they want to move forward with a vote.
“These items cannot be canceled,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University with ‘The Hill' for articles published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts whether there would be enough in the effort of Senator Jeff Flake (Republican- Arizona), who at the last minute tried to get a FBI inspection to satisfy angry voters.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning this laughter of “November is coming!” was heard by protesters as they reflected in the Seanad hall. The Republicans, who had control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move on to Kavanaugh's nomination despite the evidence given by Dr Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic. 2.
The enthusiasm of the Democrats will increase remarkably and give them great encouragement,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
• People are saying it is high, already; it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among women who are between two councils, in the suburbs and in the younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who do not like the President but do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which revealed her allegations of sexual assault against a nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts claimed there could be a reaction, if Republicans continued to advance with him to confirm the nominee.
This is a scandal that is contrary to the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanagh is appointed to the tribunal, it's also about how Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
But, it seems that there is a split between Americans, which of the two they believe is after the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh and a few more of them believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or almost entirely believe Ford's evidence and 35 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh's evidence completely or almost entirely.
Also, 38 percent of them said they believed, in whole or in large part, that Kavanaugh told lies in his testimony while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford, along with at least one other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reported by the Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her while under the influence of drinking, when she was seventeen.
Ramirez claimed that his genitals were revealed to her by the Supreme Court nominee, when they were present at a party at the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The person who has appointed the World Wide Web has plans to launch a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is to start a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technologist, Inrupt, is a body that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data, and the people allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee, with humor, stated that the desire behind Inrupt is "global domination."
We have to do it now,' he said of the initiative.
It is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create a “personal data warehouse, online” or create a POD.

It's about as if all Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would be available on one browser while all of them are available at the same time.
The particular thing about the online personal data warehouse is that it is only for the user to give access to a person, who has a particular type of information.

The idea for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive John Bruce, is to provide appropriate resources, processes and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers on the team, who have a contract to work on the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team weren't talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing or not introducing a complete change in their business models that would be inconsistent overnight conversions.
•“We are not looking for a singular permit.”
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem, to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, a voice, which has influenced the debate about internet neutrality, played in Berners-Lee.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A clerk who won the Victoria Cross is celebrated in World War 1.
His home town has been celebrated as a clerk in the Church of England, the only clerk to win the Victoria Cross during World War 1 as a fighter.
Lieutenant Colonel, Rev. Bernard Vann, won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Belleglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later and he never knew that he had won the highest award in the British army.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "great symbolism" that would reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette on 28 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin “through heavy fog and under heavy attack from field guns and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of shooters and with “excellent bravery” led the line to the forefront before raiding a field gun alone and knocked three of the detachments.
A German navigator killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of World War II.
Michael Vann, aged 72, said his grandfather's actions were “something I could never do but something that goes to my heart.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “it was a great honour to take part in the parade” and he also said that the support that many people will give was demonstrated by the courage of a true hero.
IMMA's followers stayed seated all night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, they found Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you have stayed sitting all night to look at Bellator 206, which is full to bar but you don't manage to look at the main event.
There were 13 fights on the list from San Jose, six rounds on the main list and it was being shown in a live broadcast through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just when Gegard Mousassi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to fight each other, an audience in the UK was stung when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't too impressed after they sat down until early in the morning to see the fight.
One trailer called the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
It is a government regulation that did not fit the programme and therefore had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator, who was in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Cooker, said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage to the UK's future viewers.
I think, when I think about the re-fight we can work it out," says Coker.
But it is six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work this out until the time here on Sundays and the time there on Mondays.
But we want to fix it.
Believe me, when the program changed over there, many texts were going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We wanted to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not a government issue.
I can assure you it won't happen next time.
We will set five rounds instead of six - as we usually do - and tried to provide the trailers with too much and we went too far.
This is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘sufferable’ due to his sexuality.
The Olympic diver, Tom Daley, says he considered himself not as good as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that encouraged him to make progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't understand until he went to secondary school “everyone was not like me.”
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that since he was a parent now it was not so important for him to win in the Olympics.
The average presenter on the show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
While on Laverne's first programme as a person on a deserted island, Daley said he looked at himself as “less” than everyone else, when he was growing up as “it was not socially accepted that boys and girls would like a person.”
He said: “To this day, those feelings are that I have looked at myself as less and feel different, in the things that have certainly given me the power and the strength to be able to achieve things."
He wanted to prove that it was something worth ‘something', he said, so as not to disappoint everyone, when they finally found out about their sexuality.
The award-winning two bronze medals in the Olympic Games have become a popular campaigner for LGBT ( Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) at the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to ask more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any implication and wanted to give “hope” to others.
Daley, who was a three-time world champion, said he fell in love with American film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was last year but said there has never been any problem with the gap between the ages.
“When you get so much at a very young age” - he first went to the Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find one of his comas who had been so many times in the past in his life.
The couple have been parents since June. They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that “the whole outlook on life” has changed.
If you asked me last year what was important, it was all about ‘wining a gold medal,' he said.
“Do you know, things are more important than Olympic gold coins.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, has the same name as his father, Robert, when he was found to have had brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him ‘you won't be around to be in the front row, Dad,' he said.
I had a hand grip on him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit it wasn't conclusive until he stopped breathing and he was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I knew that was the dream I had in my life - diving in front of a town crowd at the Olympic Games, there couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first choice of songs - Proud with Heather Small - which impressed him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes a comeback.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not functioning properly on the Ryder Cup bench, was added on Saturday.
American, Phil Mickelson will have reached the summit on Sunday when he will play in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but he will have to improve their playing, if he wishes it will not be a unpleasant event for him.
Jim Furyk, captain, Mickelson, sent to the representatives' bench for four-ball games and four-part games on Saturday. Mickelson was playing in the bi-annual tournament for the 12th time, a summit item.
Despite being in the middle of the tournament, as it often used to be for the United States, Mickelson, who had won five major tournaments, shared his time as a patriot and practicing his playing on the range in hopes that he could solve whatever problem he was experiencing.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was at the top of his league, the 48-year-old player is not suitable for a narrow course With Golf National, where the long-haired, regular, puts off beats that go astray.
And if the course itself isn't difficult enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will compete with the round champion of the British Open, Francisco Molinari, who is Tommy Fleetwood, who is his first year of play, is a partner and has won the four games this week.
If the Americans have a good start, which is four points to the end at the start of the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he trusted it, but he couldn't say much else.
He fully understood his part here today, praised me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
• He is very confident in himself.
He is a person who has achieved a great reputation in the past, and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and for this week.
I probably didn't listen to two songs.
I imagined more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going to move.
He wants to be out there with everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's attempt for the one who played the greatest number of games on Sundays.
It may end up informing a regime that has never been as good as its personal endeavor.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 of which he lost and seven that he shared, though Furyk said there were some intangible things for the team because of its existence.
He is funny, funny, eloquent, likes to be teasing people and is a great person in the staff room,” he explained.
“I think the young players enjoyed a sport of teasing, too, this week, which was funny to see.
It provides more than just the play."
Thomas Bjorn realises that a large excess can leave without delay.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from his own experience that at the beginning of the day a good addition to the single games in the Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danish played for the first time in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where his captain, Seve Ballesteros played five points ahead of the Americans but barely defeated with the smallest gap between them, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You continue to remind yourself that we had a huge surplus at Valderrama; we had a huge surplus at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, when we just won, but barely," Bjorn, who is pictured after watching Rang 2018 winning 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to be the top 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, the history will tell me and everyone that this is not over.
The first half of the morning.
Go out and do the right things.
This is not about the points on the table.
We have a goal and that's the win of this coil, and the focus remains there.
I have already said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our team, but we know well who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted about the way his players played and said: “I would not read too much into it.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is about how each individual player will create and there is something different to do there.
It's great to be out there with a partner, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then a full try at your potential as a golfer.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, which is to play on top of your abilities tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind you and he also has to play at the top of his potential."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will overstate his players to be able to play better as individual players than they played with their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four points.
Furyk has experienced the two results of a major change on the last day since he was a member of the Brooklyn winning team and then to become a member of the losing team, when Europe achieved the “Magical at Medinah”.
I remember every word of it,” he said in response when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he urged his players at the beginning of the day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When that energy goes on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle of members.
We set our team like that and put out the players as we wanted, you know, to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of showing dominance in the resilience and Rory McIlroy is against him in the main game and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the first half of the day.
I joined this group of men because I think they will be good for the whole day,” Bjorn said of his choices for the single games.
Germany's ship is once again destroyed.
The newest German fleet frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the warships from the Cold War. But it will not happen until next year, due to a faulty system and the increasing cost, reported by local media.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz," the commanding ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg's new frigate has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to newspaper Die Zeit, which cited military spokesman.
The ship should be part of the Navy in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that seriously affected the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigate.
It has been suggested that they will contain a massive canon, a combination of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship, as well as attenuation technology such as reduced radar, infrared and accusative signatures.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest frigates for two years away from home ports.
But, because there was a constant delay, it means that the warships - which would allow power to be demonstrated abroad - will be out of date by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The frigate was unlucky in the news last year, when the German Navy, officially, refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had returned to the ship.
Little was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but the German media cited some "bugs on software and hardware" if it were not deployed on an opponent's mission.
shortcomings in the software were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-type vessels will be operated by a team of 120 sailors - half of the team who were on Bremen-type older frigates.
Also, it became clear that the ship is too heavy, that this reduces the operation of the ship and limits the capacity of the Naval to upgrade in the future.
The Rheinland-Pfalz, which weighs 7,000 tons, is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of the same type used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of defective hardware, the cost of the whole project - including the cost of team training - is becoming scarce.
The cost is said to have increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - originally from €2.2 billion.
Problems with the newest frigate are very important due to recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was running out of ships that can be evacuated.
The official said the issue had increased over the years as old ships were decommissioned but new ships were not replaced.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's type frigates could be part of the Navy.
The National Trust is backhearing the secret life of leather wings.
New research is underway on estate in the Scottish Highlands and aims to find out how the bat uses the country side to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of a unique flight mammal and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study of scientists at the Scottish National Trust will follow common leather wings and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton leather wings at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at special locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bat during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team will conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
A sound analysis of each record, carried out by experts, will find the frequency of calls made by bats and what each specific species does.
A habitat map will be produced and a record of their behaviour will then be recorded in a large picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the conservation advisor of nature for the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the most important habitat areas for the bats will be exposed and the way in which each of the species uses them.
This information will help to demonstrate the benefits of habitat management such as meadow creation and how best to preserve woodlands for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and across the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are under threat from buildings and development work that detracts from their existing seas and habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous where there are Flypapers and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks carried out by cat pets.
The blinds aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when they catch prey.
They find insects and obstructions in their flight path from echo, sophisticated technique.
The National Trust of Scotland, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the bats.
He has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect fodder and, sometimes, rescue.
The organization has established a separate haven for bats, the first and the only in Scotland, at the Treave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says that the estate is the best district for them.
We have a great area for bats here at Treave" he said.
• We have the old buildings, many old trees and good habitat.
But there is a lot about bats that we do not yet know, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us to understand what they want so that they can thrive."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats, before maintaining buildings and residences, as if it were destroyed with only a single parent, it could kill up to 400 female bats, young bats and, perhaps all the bats in that area.
Leather wings are protected and it is against the law to kill, disturb, stir or destroy their fodder.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Leather Wing Conservation Trust, calls on the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats and, for many of our species, we don't know how the entire communities are doing.
Ronaldo denies the rape he was accused of as lawyers are about to put the law on a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has accused him of being baptized as “fake news,” stating that people want to “publicize themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to take a legal case against a German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is claimed that he then gave her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram live video with his fans several hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33 years, attacked the reports and called them “fake news”.
• No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news, “the one who won the Ballon d'Or five times said while speaking into the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be famous, when they mention my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy person and everything is good,” the player said and smiled at him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take a legal case against Der Spiegel about the allegations. They called him “unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for “damages, at a level consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident occurred in June 2009 at a location in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have gone back to the player's room where he had a keen rape, claimed, according to papers filed at the County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent” well but the “one percent” let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that both had sex but it was a sex consensus.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken photographs of her injuries at a hospital but agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “sick to be avenged” and feared that she would “be shamed in front of the public.”
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the arrangement because she is very upset, always, about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident happened, and this summer, he moved to a massive club, Juve, in an arrangement worth €100 million.
Brexit: The UK would have ‘always regretted' if it lost car manufacturers.
The UK, if it loses its status as a global leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, would have ‘always regretted, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said it was “a cause of concern” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC unsolved, it would stop car production at its factory at Burnaston, close to Derby.
We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car maker said jobs could be lost, if there was a delay at the border, in the event that there would be no solution to the Brexit.
Burnaston's factory - which manufactures the Toyota Auris and Avensis - made almost 150,000 cars last year and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union unsolved at the end of March it is clear that car production will stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers have said that they are concerned about an unresolved exit from the EU in terms of how cross-border trade will work; these include Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks associated with the supply chains in the event of an unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on a “just in time” basis. Parts come from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for a car made for an order.
If the UK leaves without a solution on 29 March, the border could be disrupted, resulting in delays and shortages of parts, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day inventory at Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan “has been made out accurately to avoid a delay like this at the border.”
We want to have the best solution, not just that our current success will allow us to continue, but that we will seize this opportunity," he told the BBC.
Our evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we are able to continue the highly successful supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be a lot of stops, but in the long run, it said that the additional costs of the factory's competitiveness and loss of jobs would ultimately reduce.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a convenant for Unite headquarters in the factory. He said his members' concerns were increasing more. “In my experience when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: “We have provided an accurate and reliable plan for the future relationship with the EU.
The meeting between Trump and the White House can be delayed again, says the White House.
An important Donald Trump meeting with the deputy Attorney General could be postponed to another week as the fight under the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of a special advocate, Robert Mueller, who is exploring Russia's interference with the election, a relationship between Trump's expert assistants and a possibility that the president had made an obstacle to justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the attorney general and thereby put Mueller's independence at risk is the backlash that has been heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a string to record conversations with Trump and the possibility that the president could be removed from office through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein said the story.
But he went to the White House last Monday and the story was that he was about to quit his job.
In exchange, it was announced that there would be a meeting on Thursday with the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid the Senate committee hearing of the judges in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's plenary hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting she said: “There is no set date for it yet, but I could imagine it would be postponed another week because of all the things going on in the supreme court.
We will see, and I always like to keep the pressmen informed."
There are some reporters who would not agree with that statement: Sanders had no press briefing from September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why this was so.
Sanders said the briefings weren't short because he didn't like TV reporters “doing war,” although she said: “I wouldn't deny that they're making war.”
She then suggested that Trump and the press should have more direct contacts.
“The president has more questions and answers than any previous president,” she said, but she did not mention any evidence of this. “We looked at those figures.
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but “if pressmen have a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States that will be a thousand times better than speaking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us doing it often in the past few weeks and this will be replaced by a press briefing when you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with well-known visitors.
There is rarely a single press conference.
The president might have shown why in New York this week when he met with a bunch of reporters in an unrestricted way that was sometimes strange.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland to thank them and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament Member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter and less than six months left until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to paying for the cost of applications for status as citizens of the EU working in public devolved services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: Negotiations were ongoing between the UK and the EU on Britain's departure, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is increasing their preparations for an event without any possible settlement.
I know this is going to be a big hit for you all.
That's why I want to express my respect for the work of all staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie's Crisis Operated When He Hurt His Head
Mike Organ of the Tennessees reported that the line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, had suffered a crisis surgery when his head was injured when the Vanderbilt Commodores won them 31-27.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred to him shortly before half time.
He came to the sideline and fell off a pit," Reed said.
Abercrombie's oxygen was supplied by trainees and medical personnel on the line side before they put it on a stretcher and gave it back to carry out further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had been taken from the observatory at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there is no information yet available about the nature/size of the injury” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a red shirt sophomore and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game making him a total of 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign merchants will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign merchants will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people in accordance with the Tory plans
The plan will remove the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to it
Stamp duty will be charged to those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Government estimates that £120 million will be raised annually to help homeless people.
Theresa May will today announce a higher rate of stamp duty on foreign merchants when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be considered as an effort to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the additional money will be used to speed up Government efforts to deal with people living outside the UK.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and on rented homes - could be as high as three per cent.
The government estimates it could raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that people who do not live in the UK buy 13 percent of the newly built buildings in London which raises prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first home.
Many of the country's hazardous areas - particularly in the capital - are scalars due to the high number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty to help more young people have their first place of residence.
He accused large construction companies that they were keeping residential prices high by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to abolish quotas on affordable homes to solve Britain's “life-shame” of “housing”.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of prominent proposals for housing including rent control and the removal of people without fault.
He wants to give more power to new members.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that my aim during my tenure as prime minister would be to re-awaken the British vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes correcting our housing breakdown market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live life here.
It shouldn't be as easy for people who don't live in the UK, and for companies based abroad to buy homes as easy as British residents who work hard.
The dream of having their own residences is a dream far away from them, and how many people go to sleep is an insult."
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to become a manager of Scotland.
The leader of Sunderland, Jack Ross, said his last ambition was to be the manager of Scotland at some point.
42-year-old Jack is Scottish and is enjoying a revival of the North Eastern club. They are third in First League, three points from the top.
He moved to the State of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League in the last season.
When I was a player I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was the amount." said Ross on Sportsbound BBC Scotland.
But when I was growing up, my dad and I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden and it is always for my attraction back.
I will not have this opportunity unless I am successful as manager of a club."
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were previously managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross had previously dominated Alloa Athletic and said he had no concern to succeed such a great club and rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My current yard of measurement in terms of success is to have this club put me back in the Premier League.
Because of the structure and axes of this club there is no doubt that it should be in the Main League,” he said.
It's not an easy task but I wouldn't succeed if I didn't manage to put it back there."
Ross has spent only three years as manager, serving as an assistant leader with Dumbarton and 15 months on the Harts coaching team.
He helped Alloa to recover from being placed in the third series and made such a transformation to St Mirren who was at risk of being disqualified for winning the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now if he felt like playing with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“At the time of the fates, probably,” he said, referring to taking command of Alloa.
I really believed that a job as a manager was the right job for me rather than a job as a player.
That may seem strange when I say it but I did a lot of good, I had a decent entry and enjoyed some relatively high highlights.
Life can sometimes be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to do a week after a week.
I have to deal with the stress and pressure of work but I feel like life is the life of the manager for me.
I always wanted to be a manager and since now I have that job my mind has been more relaxed than it has been since I was of age."

5.30pm Saturday is the perfect time for a pint according to a survey
The summer heat wave is adding to the arrival of British pubs struggling but putting extra pressure on shared chains.
The figures showed that pubs' arrivals increased by 2.7 per cent, while shared arrivals declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of CGA's consultancy business compiled the figures: “The English participation in July in the World Cup lasted longer than expected until July's patron continued when pub revenue was 2.8 per cent higher but the prints were still met more intensively.
There was a 1.8 per cent decrease in print trade in June and the situation was even worse in July.
pubs and bars focusing on drinking were much better and replica-sharing was worse off.
The heat of the sun removed your pubs that were focusing on food matters but it didn't have as dramatic an impact on the printmakers as it had on them.
People just don't want to go out and drink.
The sales of pubs and bars managed increased by 6.6 per cent during the month and the sale of food declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman of RSM guest and leisure analysts said: “These findings have shown the trends we are seeing since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major sporting and social events are the biggest factors when it comes to out-of-town market sales.
It's no wonder that groups are constantly struggling, and they'll find it very difficult to accept a 4.8 percent drop year after year in addition to the constant pressures they face in terms of cost.
The hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we'll see if the lower temperatures we had in August will give them a much needed relief.
Overall 2.7 percent growth in July in pubs and allotments, including newly opened places, reflecting the delay in the provision of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pubs, bars and sharing sector and analyzes data from 47 working groups that collectively have a turnover of over £9 million and Coffer Peach Tracker serves as the benchmark of the industry.
One in five children have a secret social media account hidden from their parents.
One in five children - some 11 years old - have a secret social media account and keep it hidden from their parents and teachers.

Twenty percent of students indicated they have a “main account” that they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed that fake pages were growing “insta” - a reference to an Instagram photo exchange site.
This has increased the number of people who are interested in the subject matter.
Twenty percent of students said they have a ‘key account’ to show their parents and also have a private account.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter in which a teenager was urging others to “force me”.
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Independent School Principals Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and that those with them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: “How many teenagers are being attracted to create online spaces in places where parents and teachers cannot access them is of concern.
Eilidh Doyle will act as the “voice of athletes” on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's most distinguished athlete in range and field and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“The Scottish, UK and world sportsmen have the utmost respect for Eilish and we are sure that it will go a long way to making Scottish athletics a reality on the table,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of athletes and I hope that I can make my own share to lead the sport in Scotland."
America was left without a walking ability after suffering a temporary attack of blood restriction despite winning a 200 metre and 400-metre race at the 1996 Atlanta Games and having a total of four Olympic gold medals.
He wrote on Twitter: “I hit a attack a month and a day.
I couldn't be happy
The doctors said we had to wait to see if I would get better and if so, how much better would it be.
It was a really hard work but I did come back full resilience, I learned how to walk again and I'm doing athletic drills today!
Thank you for the encouragement you sent me!
There are conflicting opinions online about a notification that milk is being compared to cows by pregnant mothers.
A company that offers breast pump by notice has an online motivational controversy where women who give breast to a child are compared to cows who are being hunted.
On the occasion of the launch of the “world's first breast-feeding portable pump” the tech company Elvie launched a semi-serious announcement that was inspired by music to reflect the freedom that the pump brings to milk-taking mothers.
There were four mothers dancing in a barn full of grass and playing lyrics such as: “Yes, I'm hooking myself but you don't see any tails” and “For fear that you didn't notice it these are only my boobs.”
The chorus continues: “Be pumped out, pumped out, I'm feeding those children. “Be pumped out, pumped out, I'm hooking up my women.”
The announcement was published on the company's Facebook page and sparked online controversy.
It was viewed and referred to by 77,000 people, many of whom said it ignored the “horror aspects” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product,” one person wrote.
• We seem to have to have a calf to milk, but in the case of those whose children are stolen from them a few days after the birth.
Elvie's breast pump can be neatly placed inside an intruder's breastplate (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote this: “It is clearly a traumatic thing for the mother and the child.
Yes, but why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another wrote: “The like of your announcement. It was cut off from life.”
Others defended the announcement and one woman admitted that she thought the song was very funny forever.
“I think it's a great plan.
I'd still have milk.
I just felt like a cow when the pumping took place.
It's a bit of a surprise, but I took it on my own.
This product was designed by a high-end person,” wrote another.
Another person had this reference: This is a comical announcement aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like “ba”.
This is not a notice recommending or criticising the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the women suggest that they were dancing and the pump grew discreetly into their finals.
The campaign is based on the assumption that a lot of women pumping their boobs consider them to be a bat.
Elvie Pump is completely quiet, does not have wires or tubes, sits discreetly inside a cage so that women are able to move around, keep their children in their hands and even go out while they are pumping.
This was said by Ana Balarin, who is a partner and deals with early childhood development by Mother: The Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it earned a bold, exciting launch.
When we show the relationship between pregnant women and dairy cattle we want to highlight breast secretion and all the challenges it poses, and demonstrate the incredible freedom of the new pump and do so on an entertaining but interesting way that people can talk about.
This wasn't the first time Elvis had been in the series.
The mother of two walked down a manic scene during the London Fashion Week using the product. She was portraying the work of designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Settled to Camp a Tent on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children arrested has increased dramatically, although the number of people crossing the border has slightly changed, as it is now more difficult to add children to sponsors due to Trump's tough policies and hard talk.
What has happened in the past is that migrants were without immigration documents sponsored by the migrants but are now afraid that they will risk their ability to stay in the country by applying to sponsor a child.
That risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that people wishing to become sponsors and adults would have to give their family their finger and that those details would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior officer with the Immigration and Customs Authority, told the Congress last week that the agency had arrested the scores of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later revealed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 percent of those who are sponsors, or are members of sponsors' household, are in this country illegally, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
For this reason we are always chasing those people,' said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, the officials introduced new rules that some will require to appear before a court within a month of their arrest, rather than after 60 days, which were, according to previous standard period, a standard period of refuge workers.
Many will present themselves through a video conference rather than in person, to make a claim to an immigration judge for legal status.
Those who feel that they are not eligible to receive relief will be quickly expelled from the country.
Home workers and reports that have come from the system in recent months for as long as children are in detention are more likely to become anxious or depressed and lead to violent incidents or attempts to escape.
Supporters said that these concerns are added to larger facilities such as Tornillo which is so large that a child is not seen to be struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally, or to say goodbye to their friends, that could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria ‘orders for arresting forces’ of America, France and Turkey to be cleared of the country immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that this is the eighth year of war in that country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, has declared that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal with apologies that they are fighting against terrorism, and that they will be dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately without any conditions,” he said to the assembly.
Moualem declared “the war against terrorism is almost over” in Syria where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of people have been driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fell the blessed war until we clear up” terrorist groups and “any illegal alien force from all the territories of Syria.”
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country.
For the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return and blamed “some western countries” who are “spreading unreasonable concerns” who are encouraging refugees to stay outside the country.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their rescue,' he said.
They are asking a political question that should be dealt with as a humanitarian issue only.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said that the recent agreement made by Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey will ensure that the Russian-backed Syrian forces do not inflict a large-scale invasion on the province of which there are three million people living.
However, Moualem stressed how the agreement is characterised by “clear targets of time” and said he hoped that jihadists including the Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Quaeda and “will be destroyed.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of the new committee to include representatives of the government and opposition to draft a constitution for Syria for the time being that the war is over and in preparation for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee and said that the committee's work must be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution,” and he fulfilled his mandate not to put them in the news.
Trump's second term
According to this understanding Mr. Trump should win the election in 2020 unless, as many liberals expect, an impeachment or scandal will put an end to a presidency ahead of time.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic conclusion of a Presidency!
There is currently no sign that the audience is getting tired of it.
The prime time rates have doubled to 1.05 million since 2014 for CNN and MSNBC rates have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to their 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" was on top of the cable rates and up to 3.5 million people watched it on major news events.

The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?' said Sis.
“Because he makes me laugh,” he said, which was what Mr. Scovell told me.
There is peace in the world.
Of course life is not like a television program and the stories from Washington may influence what will happen in the future case Roe v. Wade, and whether migrant families can come together again, and the health of the world economy.
It is only for the most vulnerable people to get rid of the virus.
However, there is more to it than being an informed citizen when looking at a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used "deep background" as a source of his book "Man," or a pilot's cask with his or her ostraise feathers bought by paul Maanfort for $15,000 (the Washington Post said she was “abandoned with hores” or the obscene implications of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump's life members.

Money flows into the mid-term elections.
It is not surprising that a silver flood has been pouring into the 17 Pennsylvania area since a new version of the conference areas was put in place so that two elected members are competing for the same seat.
A new border for the suburb of Pittsburgh was designed in such a way that the Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another area in a special election last spring
against current Republican MP Keith Rothfus, who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's 12 old district, who heavily overlaps on a new district of 17.
The maps were redrawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally laid out in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th new district began a heavy blow round between the party's main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name is popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Conference District in March which was watched by a lot of people.
The seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Trump has won the area with 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are a little ahead.
U.S. was considering punishing the Salvator for support for China but withdrew from it.
Politicians noted that Beijing was recognized by the Dominican Republic and Panama and that Washington did not do much about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela Panama in July 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until their partners ordered Trump's Organization management to leave.
Heather Nauert, spokesperson for the department said in a statement that officials of the State Department decided to call back American diplomatic mission leaders from the El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “most recent decisions have been made without further recognition of Taiwan.”
However, it was not considered to impose penalties on any of them except for the Salvadoran who received $140 million in aid in 2017 from America, including drug control aid along with development and economy support.
The proposed penalties included financial assistance, targeted restrictions on visas that would severely affect this country in Central America with high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue from a similar meeting held last year and was deemed to be progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior officials of the administration indicated before mid-September that they wished the conference to go ahead with anything that ended any plan to impose penalties on the Salvadoran.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak at the conference that will take place in mid-November and diplomats say that this shows that the administration considers the meeting very important.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no tough messages about penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to speak about the details of the dispute but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition that their names would not be mentioned.
An external analyst supported the accounts they gave but spoke (or spoke) provided his/her name would not be mentioned.
History Studies
The next hit may be the Robert Mueller's special adviser's report on how Mr. Trump might have been barred from justice and there is a lot of evidence in the public record.
There are reports in the round that Mr. Mueller is also focusing on whether Mr. Trump was working in collusion with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If another party gets the lead in the U.S. Congress then Mr. Trump may have to account for what he did in the past just when he will be going before the voters and possibly before the jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty about the situation and I don't want to suggest that it's inevitable that Mr. Trump will be blamed or anyone like him in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the confrontation will continue.
Officials in the German army were ready to put Hitler on his feet in 1938 if the West stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakians at Munich.
We didn't take the opportunity to avoid the years of the sludge that followed him.
The course of history revolves around such points and the movement of democracy will be delayed or accelerated.
The United States has a lot of these issues.
What if Mr. Trump gives a stick and a road to the Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the future of Mr. Mueller's inquiry?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since last year's newspaper reported that he was recording the president in secret and disclosed comments that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' account is inaccurate.
What to say if the F.B.I. inquiry recently asked Brett Kavanaugh will be complete or fair - or if the Supreme Court judge is renewed despite plausible allegations that he has sexually assaulted and given dishonest evidence.
And above all else will we vote in the mid-term elections for the U.S. Congress that will ensure Mr. Trump has to account for what he did?
If we fail these tests, there will be a long and difficult winter for democracy.
I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and the same Nazi regime that took her at the time of my diplomatic home was expelled to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America and set me up 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table on which the swastika was.
Since this is my heritage, how can I have hope for what we are going through?

Graham Dorrans hopes about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be hosts when they play against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers were very successful when they finished a match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and win on Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury caused Graham Dorrans and was unable to play his first game this season until the game against Villarreal ended on a 2-2 score. However, Rangers believe that this result will allow Rangers to take advantage of it to achieve better things.
“This would be a good thing for us as Villarreal is a fine team,” says Graham who is 31 years old.
“We went to the game as we expected to get an advantage from it and we got a point.
We could win at the end but overall it was a good result on a score.
They were probably better in the first half but we got better in the second half and we were better than them.
It will be a great European evening.
I hope we succeed by getting three points but it will be a hard game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I'm sure we can push forward and get a positive result.
We had a hard year last year, with the injuries that happened to me and the changes that happened in the club itself but we think everything is fine now.
They are good, and they are good; they are good.
I hope that now we can push forward, put the last season behind us and have a guarantee of success."
Women losing sleep at night due to anxiety about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the people who took part in the survey had a clear idea of how they wished to be cared for, many of them were not talking to their family members about the situation.
About half of those who took part in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them but they're not doing anything to talk to them about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life assurance business.
This is the place to start.
You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't tell them much in advance what you need.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as these may have a significant impact on the cost.
Please tell your financial advisor to give advice: The advisor can advise you on how to pay for these costs.
Long-term care options - a traditional policy of insurance for long-term care, a hybrid policy of value for money to help you pay for those costs, or to provide self-insurance for your own wealth - may include the following as long as you have the money.
Confirm your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they start.
Design a health care provider to act on your behalf in order to be able to appoint someone you trust to look after your medical care and to ensure that professionals meet what you need in case you are unable to communicate.
Think about giving someone power of attorney when it comes to your money matters.
You should choose someone you trust to make money decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are left with disabilities.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical crisis and is on his/her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about the field of medicines and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan for you to be prepared.
It's not just the money matters, but who are the doctors?" says Martin.

He was not at risk of death and the police asked witnesses to speak to them.
earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and the Palu city tsunami hit Indonesia on Friday and the number of dead is expected to increase.
The communications systems have been destroyed and relief officers are unable to obtain any information from the respiratory of Donggala, located north of Palau and closer to the groundquake epicentre which had 7.5 strength.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the main facts about Palau and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palau is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the east coast of the island of Sulawesi and estimated that there were 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Donggala is a renaissance that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency is an administrative region of less than a province with an estimated 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of the central province of Sulawesi is largely dependent on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is made in Morowali on the other coast over from Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala earthquakes and tsunamis have often met in the last 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami struck the west of Donggala in 1996 and nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area of the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake occurred on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December that triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean and half of them died in Aceh.
2005: A series of western Sumatra coastal earthquakes hit late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a strength of 6.8 in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered a tsunami that swept into the south coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of the size of 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and initiated a tsunami that was up to 10 meters high that destroyed the village scores and killed about 300 people.
2016: Pidie Jaya's repulsion in Aceh was struck by a shallow earthquake. It caused damage and panic to the people who remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
At that time, more than 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Lombok's tourist island was struck by earthquakes and killed more than 500 people.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily.
Sarah Palin's eldest son is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assaulting.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of being guilty of domestic violence, interfering with sending a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman who knew him tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took his phone from her.
According to a report from KTUU Palin has been postponed to Mat-Su Pretrial Facility while keeping it on a $500 bond.
According to the network when he appeared before a court on Saturday and was asked what he was pleading he replied “not guilty, certainly positive”.
Three class A misdemeanors are being attributed to Palin which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been accused of a class B misdemeanor which means he could be sentenced to a day in prison together with a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time a criminal charge has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Court of Appeal.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interference with domestic violence reporting, possession of an army while under the influence of a substance for the incident.
He claimed that he had given her a fist in the face.
A group of former soldiers condemned Sarah Palin in 2016 because she suggested that her son's violent behavior stemmed from a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Hundreds died of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people are dead due to an earthquake that hit the island of Indonesia's Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake had a size of 7.5 and initiated a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications systems have been well off and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a short distance from the center of Sulawesi which is on the northeastern side of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos being sent on social media showing the moment the earth began to tremble.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beachside festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami erupted into them.
Death Penalty claimed by Federal Prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the death penalty to be imposed on Sayfullo Saikov who is suspected of having committed the terrorist attack in which eight people have been killed, a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state due to a federalist crime since 1953.
It is alleged that a 30-year-old Saikov used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a range of bikes along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and that he had previously overthrown pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight victims and that, according to the announcement of the intention to seek the death penalty, he committed serious bodily harm, filed in the South District of New York.
Both of these causes are accompanied by a possible death decision, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, Saikov's high federal jury charged in 22 charges that included eight murder charges for the benefit of camouflage, which are usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The prosecutors said the attack was called for “a great deal of planning and premeditated” and said that Saipov had done it in a “ugly, cruel and brutal way.”
Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov was responsible for the injury, harm and loss of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," specified in the confidential announcement.
Tourists from Argentina were in five of the victims.
Ten years have passed since the last time the South District of New York prosecuted for a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
1953 was the last time a federal birth was completed in New York for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg was executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saikov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to the court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done," the police said.
Saikov told the authorities that he was encouraged to take the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also called for the display of the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He was accused of 22-year-old
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, said “it is clear that they are disappointed by the prosecutors' decision.
We believe in the decision to seek the death sentence rather than accepting a plea of guilty for a life sentence without any possibility of allowing the trauma of those proceedings to be extended for all involved," Patton said.
Sapov's defense team asked previous prosecutors not to seek the death sentence
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘turn off the army of the people' today in protest at the Tory conference.
A former Ukip leader said that politicians need to be under pressure from Eurosceptics - with one of Theresa May's own MEPs suggesting that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the march in Birmingham that the UK would now be “disappeared” if Mr Farage were to become the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May is highlighted in her attempt to bring together her party's split and Toryers after taking part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the prime minister to keep Chequers' conciliation plan on the right track while attacking Brexit supporters, waiters and the EU.
Her supporters confirmed that she will continue to try to reach a deal with Brussels despite the response - and will force Eurosceptics to choose between her own package and a ‘beat-talent’.
Mr. Bone at the rally said Event in Solihull means he wanted to throw out ‘Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be peered at and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
If he were in charge, we would be gone now,' he said.
Wellingborough MEP added: ‘I will stand for Brexit but we need to throw out Chequers.'
Explaining the reasons why it is against the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought world wars to make us humble.
We want to make our own laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that the popular opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds has changed their minds that they are trying to stay out of lies.'
Tory Brexit supporters Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the parade, told reporters: ‘I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition to vote for him, neither our party nor our activists who walk in the streets and get us votes in the first place are happy with him.
I ask you to throw out Chequers and start listening.'
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘Prime ministers keep their positions when they add to their word.'
Mr Farage said at the rally that politicians need to be ‘pressed’ if they are about to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
‘This is a matter of mutual trust - the people - and our political class,' he said.
‘They want to leave the Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘we won't let you do that.'
In a speech to the enthusiastic crowd he added: ‘I want you to put pressure on our political class, who is about to abandon the Brexit.
‘We are going to put away the army of the people in this country who have won the Brexit victory and we will not allow our rest to be an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, waiters marched through Birmingham before running a two-hour rally in the city centre.
There were a number of anti-Brexit activists following the group's launch this weekend.
The Peer from the Labour Lord Adonis was mocked by the Conservatives for their security difficulties with a party application as the conference began.
These are the people who tell us that they can apply the IT systems as well as all the technology for Canada and more, for a borderless, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
Such a fool.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,' he said.
Warren intends to ‘look closely’ at a position in the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he is going to “look closely at a position in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is standing for election again in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
He said he would fight against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electors using the format of the town hall meeting since Trump began his term of office.
One of the attendees asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman at the top.
A person arrested after the death of Sims was released from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday announced that a suspect was arrested on suspicion of the basketball player's dead release from LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at a conference at 11a.m. E.T.
They released a video of the release on Friday, seeking help to identify a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was released and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot wound for the head and died for it,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayne was trying to protect his friend and was released by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the scene of crime, had an army, and admitted that he had released Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without difficulty and brought into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and his average per game was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after the team orders him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the empty beach after he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack each other's teams.
Vettel first entered the shafts and left Hamilton to meet the traffic at the back of the pack, something that should have a big impact on affairs.
The Mercedes went to the stop one subsequent circuit shaft and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-by-wheel activity after the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside and the risk of standing up to double movement after protection on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the rear of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first circuit on his 21st birthday.
Then he was ahead for much of the race while holding on to his bases to focus on a fast territory and surpassing Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the shafts on the 44th circuit but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight circuits while Raikkonen was taking fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri made a great effort all weekend and he was a gentleman to the extent that he let me go.
The team has done an excellent job with one of them,” Hamilton said.
It was then that a horrible body signaling
President Donald Trump was mocking Senator Dianne Feinstein mocking on Saturday after she argued that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which the nominee was accused of sexual assault to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deal with the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Judicial Committee, but rather he said what was going on in the Senate indicated that people were “inhuman and ugly and false."
The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and dishonest and ugly and false," he said.
“When you look at stories of release and leakage and they say “Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you sure?
Remember his answer... did you exhaust his document - “Oh, what?
Oh, there wasn't a leak.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
We didn't leak,' he also said as he recited to the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the allegations at Kavanaugh at Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his own office.
I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not leak his story, "said Einstein to the committee, reported in The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she requested.
But it seemed that the president did not accept his denial, saying during a Saturday night mobilization: “I will tell you the truth, it was a terrible body sign there.
She may have done it but that's the worst body signaling I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the nominee to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on their own.
• They are set to take back the power, no matter how they do it.
You see the awkwardness, the uglyness, no matter who they hurt, who they have to put under their feet to gain power and control," the president said in a mediaite report.
The Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
A expiation in the Offensive League against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were ahead at two backs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a match before Dwyer put the Giants to the ground again.
Francois Bouchard scored a match for Dundee before winning after two goals at Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Outstanding series for Adam Cokee's team, who came from the back to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get a second back for the team four minutes later.
During a very busy start-up period, Sullivan took the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the opponent to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead of the first break before scoring his second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The town side reorganized themselves several times Bouchard achieved a match for them with a massive backlash at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran met to help Nielsen put Dundee first in the game last in the second period and made sure that they would win with his team's fifth half-way back through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four out of the last five games, will play against Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic regulator dies to make sure hundreds of people on a plane can escape from a earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is said to be a hero after he died while ensuring that a plane that had been occupied by hundreds of people safely rose up.
More than 800 people have died and many have been missing after the island was hit by a major earthquake on Friday by Sulawesi as it was triggered by a tsunami.
The area is still being hit by strong former vibrations and many people stranded in the debris in the city of Palau.
But despite his colleagues fleeing with their soul, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to depart from his position in the wildly shaking regulatory tower at Mutiara Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He then waited to make sure the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would rise safely.
Then he jumped off a control tower when he thought he was falling apart.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported in the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
We lost it in the morning before the arrival of the helicopter Paulo.
Our hearts are broken when we hear about this,' he said.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that thousands of people may be dead and the country's disaster mitigation agency are saying there is a border on entry to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The number of dead is still projected to increase as many bodies were still under the debris as many were unable to reach,” the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Palu is destroyed by waves that reach up to six meters and a mass burial will take place there on a Sunday.
Army and business aircraft are taking in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother to Sky News, said: “Every minute an ambulance takes in body.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small markets have been created everywhere."
Jan Gelland, head of the International Red Cross Association in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross Association in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but they don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy already here, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country's army: “I am asking you all to work day and night to do all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says one man has been missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that was operating a flight to crash into a Pacific lagoon in the Micronesia says one man is missing, having earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew members departed safely from the immersive plane.
Air Niugini said in an issue that since the afternoon on Saturday there was no finding a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators as he tried to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in constant condition.
It is not yet clear what was responsible for the crash and what exactly happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had gone over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
That's a great thing,' said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to navigate through water to the escape routes on the immersive plane.
He said there was a panic about the plane servers and they were shouting and he suffered a minor injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy said nearby working sailors helped improve the rescue by using an inflatable boat to take people to a beach before diving the plane in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Details from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in visits by registered airlines in the past twenty years but none of them involved Air Niugini.
An analyst sets out the timeline of the night that a woman burned alive.
The prosecutors had made his case on Saturday in the retrial of men charged with burning women out of Mississippi alive in 2014.
The Analyst from the U.S. Department of Justice and Equality Paul Rowlett gave evidence for the long hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used mobile phone records to compile a story about the 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received substitute data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis was accompanied by Chambers on the night of her death, which went against what he had previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up on the Saturday stand and testified that he was not home that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth while he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was “telling lies, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
The records of mobile phones indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
“He destroyed her from his life,” Hale said.
It has been determined that the defences will bring their arguments to a close on the Earth.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip hop?
Three hip hop trios are trying to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip hop has moved away from its origins as political messages and face social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and have affection for conscious hip hop again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through the weighing of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Somebody else?!
Childminders in NY place the law on a couple after she is given a stick and a road due to a “racist” text message
Childminders in New York City have been charged with breaking the law illegally after she received a misleading text message from the mother in which she complained that she was a “other blue person”.
The couple denies that they are racist, and compares the legal case with extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two disappointed when she discovered that the new childminder, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she came for her first working day in 2016.
Oh my god, another blue person," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her twice to Ms Maurice.
After realizing that she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman gave Ms Maurice an uncomfortable, stick and roadman, stating that her departing and African-American childminders had done bad work and were expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is putting the law on the couple for breaking her out of her job, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 per day for the residential job, six months for which she was employed, although she was not given a contract.
I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do such things,' she told An Post on Friday, also saying “I know it's discrimination.
The couple have responded to the assertion that they are racist, saying that the ending of Maurice's employment was a reasonable thing, fearing they could not trust them after being disturbed.
My wife sent her something she did not intend to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the care of someone you were rude to, even if you did it by mistake?
Your new baby?
Listen now!"
Plasco compared the legal case with “switching” as he said his wife had been expecting a baby in two months and that she was “in distress.”
• Are you going to go in search of someone like that?
That's not a nice thing to do,' said the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public did not hesitate to criticize the couple on social media, and they were knocked down because of their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers wouldn't understand a talk bear
Karen's daughter Jankel, the daughter of Bond who was born soon after the book was adopted, said under the letter: “It is hard to imagine that you were reading it for the first time before it was published.
It is funny now, knowing that Paddington was a great success."
While saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman with BBC before being inspired by little teddy bears to write a book for children, would be positive, although her work was rejected, she also said that a 60-year anniversary celebration had been “happiness and sadness after his death last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as a “very important family member,” she said her father was ultimately proud of his success not to be boastful about.
“He was a quiet person, and he used to boast on his own,” she said.
But since Paddington was like a real person for him, it was almost like having a child who does well: you are proud of an essay even though you did not make the Gaisce.
I think that was the case with Paddington.
Although he was created and imagined by himself, he always gave the recognition to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to the phone
After landing her daughter was quickly taken to Nice Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
Nad used to call me regularly to say that it was very bad, that she was not expected to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I said to her.
I said, “Tashi, I love you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping were soon disappearing and disappearing from her system.
She died some time ago and now everything was shut down.
I was just sitting there and I knew this was going to happen.
I couldn't cry or cry because I had children.
I had to keep control of myself."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, as she was in mourning at the death of her daughter, went on the plane alongside the other passengers - and they did not know her heart torment.
He didn't know,' she said.
• I had my head bent and the tears flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain it but when I was on the flight I felt deeply sorry for Nad.
My love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women put up their cards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost people close to them for suicide are trying to keep others from handing over their own deaths.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up on a bridge in Wales with exciting messages as well as numbers that people can call for support.
The son of Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and shot himself to death at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and that his temper was a shock to others.
Everyone knew about him.
They always end up burning any room with their mesmerisation."
However, he resigned before his death as he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, his brother Tyler, who was 11 at the time, came after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: “I am always concerned that this will have an impact on him.
Ms Davis created the cards, “to make people aware that there are people who can talk to them, even if it is a friend.
Don't stay silent - if you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for many years, lost her 15 years, Mark, soon after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was in a low sense or that he had depression or anything," she said.
• A few days before Christmas we noticed a change of mindset.
It was at the very bottom of Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts they didn't look at them or anything."
She said that he was greatly traumatized by his death, but that they must confront him: “He rips the children apart.
It breaks us off from each other.
But we must all continue to fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy and the FBI has begun an investigation
I thought, if we were really able to find something like what it wanted - a limited investigation in terms of time, in terms of scope - that we might have unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, also saying that the committee was afraid of a “falling apart” with a tight bias.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It is because of time constraints.
There are only 5 weeks left until the mid-term elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans, as expected, are doing poorly, they will be much weaker when they want to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is calling on Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then met his wife Ashley, as personal secretary to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI has made its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Seanad floor, allowing Mike Pence, vice president, to break a tie and declare it to the Supreme Court.
A decrease in the number of people behind North Korea comes under Kim.
The number of people behind North Korea's departure to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the United South Korean ministry, said 1,127 people had given back to North Korea last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China were key factors with higher rates being charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang did not speak in public.
South Korean citizenship is eventually produced for most people who back down North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, which has the longest border near North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Non-Army Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the people behind North Korea to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their own country by pressure.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which has been technically ongoing - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held a meeting in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the nuclear disarmament negotiations that did not progress.
This happened after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general way to work towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress from there.
If there is no trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and for these reasons, there is no way that we will dearm ourselves first on our own initiative," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Says Brett Kavanaugh Is “Active”, and Not Suitable For Service In The Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the nominee to Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was “adjective” and was deeply unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I have to think if this was done by a woman, they would say “adverse,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh pondered the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two of them in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very excited, almost crying and the talk he spoke of sometimes as he spoke about his family and his time in high school.
He clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, giving “ugly and coordinated defamation” of the allegations against him and organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, which he could not serve in the Supreme Court, proved to be biased against Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way in which he pursued the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she did not agree with that.
I will say this - if it is not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not suitable not only to be in the Supreme Court but also to be in the court in which it is currently in existence," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
• It is not the right time for an adjunct, inclined person to go to court and expect us to say ‘that is not great,’ Pelosi said.
Women need to do it.
It's a serious wound, the months and years of anger being released, and it can't let it go without suffering.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's a strange thing, do you think?
She continued, “A woman who was an executive helped me a lot, saying she was also crying when she became angry, but who developed a sense of technique when she became angry and started crying, that she would tell the person with whom she used to talk, “I may feel sorry for you because I am crying.
I am angry."
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was great."
Tears are allowed as a way to release anger as they are basically not understood.
One of my sharpest memories from an early post, in an office where men were in charge, where I once found myself crying with anger that I couldn't express, was that an older woman caught hold of my neck - a manager who was always afraid of me - and pulled me into a stair log.
• Never let them see that you are crying,” she told me.
You don't know you're mad.
They will make you feel sorry and they will be happy because they upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Colorado Democrat at the time, worked with Gary Hart as he ran for the presidency.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was engaged in an out-of-marriage relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, very frustrated, decided that she should think about running for the presidency herself.
It wasn't a prudent decision," she told me as she laughed 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was last in the campaign, she was in the back in terms of fundraising so she promised to go in the race only if she had raised $2 million.
It was a free work.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 to a dise.
Do they think I get a discount?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so excited - thanks to the people who supported her, frustrated with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters rather than delegates, and anger with sexism - that she became a mattress.
You think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of the media's response to it.
I thought Kleenex was a corporate sponsor for me.
I remember thinking, what do you think I'm going to do?
“She cried?”
Why the trade war between the U.S. and China could make good for Beijing
You would be deafening at the open-airs of the war trade between the US and China, and while the war is not at all about, Beijing may benefit in the long term from a dispute between the countries, according to experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year when he taxed key Chinese exports, including solar, steel, and aluminum panels.
The most significant tightening took place this week with new tariffs that had an effect on goods valued at $200 billion (£150 billion), which meant that nearly half of all goods coming into the US from China have been taxed.
Beijing retaliates in the same way every time, with the most recent action being placing tariffs of five to ten percent on American goods at a value of $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. beat, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will be disrupted any day now.
If Washington were to be pushed back it would mean that their claims would have to be conceded, but Xi Jinping, the president of China, would have been too embarrassed if it were publicly surrendered to the US.
Still, experts say if Beijing can properly play its cards, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of both economies.
The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a failure of the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia in the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria ‘ready' to return to refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary refugee return and wants to help rebuild the country after it was destroyed by a war that had been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today matters on the ground are much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is still reforming the areas destroyed by terrorists in order for things to go back to how they usually are.
All the right conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualam said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he made it clear that she would not accept aid or conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
It is the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European Team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning its U.S. Team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European land and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe got the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best of the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the competition, threw his pitch into the water at the 16th par 3 hole, and surrendered the game to Francisco Molinari.
The Italian golfer made the deal in every round, and one of four players who ever went 5-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated at 5&4 by the lower European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player fell in the highest place in the world, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England who could have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, was the most successful European in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry but I don't have the strength to cry today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting us.
I'm so happy to have the world back.
The team is the most important and I'm glad I was able to help them," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
John Ram will come from the same country as him, which has now won the 2&1 victory over the famous golfer from the USA Tiger Woods in single games on Sunday, instead.
I am very proud of the win against Tiger Woods, I was looking at that man as I grew up," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost the four games he played in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, winning 14 major championships, and just before that Jack Nicklaus.
It was hard for the U.S. team to find the whites throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf during the entire tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's play was a disappointment, “I'm proud of these men, they fought.
In the morning, we thought we were going to Europe.
We fought.
I'm going to recommend Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players played very well.
We will re-edit ourselves, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to rejoice.
The other team played better than us."
