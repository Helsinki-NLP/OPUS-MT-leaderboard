Members of the Assembly of Wales are rebellious about 'having it'
There is a rebelling among some members after a proposal that their position should be changed to MPW ( Wales Assembly delegates).
This has come from the council’s name to the Wales Assembly.
Members of the Council from all political buildings tend to rebel that the move will lead to sarcasm.
A Lebanese messenger said that his group had no concern that the name " corresponds to Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside the Wales country: In fact, the twp means ignorant and pwp means stool.
Plaid's wing messenger said that the group as a whole "n't pleased" and has suggested an alternative name.
The conservative lawmaker said his group was a "clear in thought" about the reform of the name, but he said it was the words of the abbreviation of MWP to Kikara.
In this context, the letter w in English is pronounced equal to the letter u in the English language of Yorkshire.
The Council’s panel, which is currently enacts legislation to establish a change of name, said: “The final decision on any keyword related to how the Council members are referred to in fact will be the members of themselves.”
The Federal Law of Wales in 2017 paid the Wales Council to change its name.
In June, the Panel published public consultation results about recommendations that were broadly supported by referring to council as the Wales Parliament.
In relation to the position of the Council members, the Panel favored the Wales Parliament or WMP members, but the MWP option received more support in consultation with the public.
Similarly, Council members recommend an alternative option, but efforts to achieve an agreement can be challenging to the Administrator, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on post a few weeks.
The legislation regarding the change will include other changes to how the council operates, including law enforcement of the Council and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Council will vote on the name they will be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians will vote for comments about changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether they change the name of the country as "the Republic of North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to resolve a crisis that has been held in a decade by the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a region called Macedonia.
The authorities in the city of Athens insist that the name of the neighbouring country on the north represent a claim to their region and have continued to challenge its request to become a member of the European Union and the NATO Union.
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, a direct referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the poll.
However, opinion polling supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the move to transform the name needed to join the European Union and NATO coalition.
St. Martin Zaenda Kimya in Harlem Meets Challenges
Historically, the elders who have spoken to them had a church in every horn," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there is no one."
He said the absence of a bar is a thing that can be understood.
"People interact in different ways" nowadays, he said.
"The bar is reluctant to be as a neighboring living room where people meet regularly."
On the part of the churches, he should not be money available from selling the resources they will not last for the project they expect as well, "and after a short time they will return to their initial state."
Churches, added, may be converted into large-scale terraces owned by individuals who will not help to maintain the remaining reserves in the surrounding area.
A large number of people who buy private houses in these buildings will be white," said, "and thus it will make sure these churches are generally closed because there is no possibility that the people in these ruins will become partners of these churches."
Both churches were built by white partners before Harlem as the city of Black people - the City community in 1870 and called St. Martin one decade later.
The founders of the eldest Methodists left the 1930s.
Participants who were black members who shared the nearby area took the buildings.
St. Martin became under Black partners under Kasi John Howard Johnson, who led the strike of the refer suppliers in 125th Street, the main street for purchases in Harlem, who refused to recruit or cooperate with black people.
The fire that happened in 1939, leaving the building devastated, but the members at the Kasi Johnson church set up plans to rebuild, provided the introduction of a set of interlocked bells using a keyboard or an automated approach.
Speed David Johnson, the son of Kasi Johnson, and the successor of St. Martin, called a set of bells of the poor.”
The specialist who played a set of bells in July called another name: "The treasure of culture" and "a historically modified issue."
Professional, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also recognized that it was the first set of bells in the world that were played by black musician, Dionsio A. Lind, who moved to the greater set area in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek someone else to replace it.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin for the last few months have been played by the architects of buildings and networks, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and some brought by the bishop’s Diocese.
The Council - management authority in the parishes, consisting of church managers - written in the daysi on July with a rebel rebel in the process "has a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in recruiting buildings and contractors who were sent by the Diocese.
Some associates complained about the absence of clarity from the Diocese.
Pope injured a 13-year-old child while diving to the rope-tree in California
Pope raids a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dives into the first day of the rope-tree, the officers said.
The invasion occurred shortly before the 1 hour around Beacon Beach at Encinas.
Chad Hammel told KSWW-TV TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about half an morning day when he heard a young man shouting out for help and then blew the group to help him leave the water.
Hammel said that the first time she thought it was just a rope-tree, but “I realized she was crying out, ‘I’ve been right!
I've been!'
His shoulder bone had gone out," Hammel said he realized it once she came to a boy.
I cried out for everyone to leave the water: 'There is a water here!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported to Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego where he was listed to be in a critical situation.
A pop species that made unknown invasion.
The captain of the Rescue Larry Giles said in a press briefing that the shark had seen a few weeks ago, but it was described as not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim found wounds in the upper part of his body.
The officers locked up beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for examination and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury seeks to fight with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by using the beauty styles that have employees who are virtual professionals.
As part of planning to enter the market of value of 2.8 billion pounds in the UK, which continues to grow as the sales of fashion and home appliances decrease, the major beauty ranks will be tested in 11 shops across the country and established in more next year if this step will be successful.
Investments in beauty have grown up while supermarkets find ways to fill the shelves that used to keep TV, microwave and home appliances.
Sainsbury said that it would double the delivery of beauty products up to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawpaw for the first time.
An existing brand from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more spaced with branded sites that match the shops such as Boots.
This huge store also relaunches a small cosmetic product shop so that most of the products are useful for people who don’t eat meat – something that is highly pressured by young buyers.
In addition, the vendor of fragrances returned to Fragrance Shop will do an experiment in the two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and daily food product buying preferences for a small scale in the nearest Retail shop means the supermarket should make more effort to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive in Sainsbury, said the shop will be more visible as the units' stores as a chain of supermarkets trying to respond to the Adil and Lidl by providing more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has been introducing small shops of Argos into hundreds of shops and has also been launched some of the Habits stores starting from when it bought the two cycles last two years, which says it has increased vegetable exports and make customer access more beneficial.
The original test of the big store to revive its beauty units and medicine recognized the empty.
Sainsbury tested a joint project with Boots earlier in 2000, but the union emerged on how to divide revenue from its supermarkets.
A new approach was established after Sainsbury’s trade of shop 281 minutes for Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds, three years ago.
It is said that Lloyds will contribute to the program, by adding more elegant face handling brands and skins including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury’s business, said: “We have changed the visibility and status of our beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in the employees who are available to provide advice.
Our brand has been designed to meet all the interesting needs and situations where it means we’ve now become an exciting place for beauty products where it offers a great competition in the original way to make shopping.”

A consistent conversation ‘and then we love one’
He met with criticism that he would get from the news organizations by making comments that others would consider to be a "non-profit president" and by praising the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump cut much more disappointment?
Trump said with his voice of mock "newsman".
"I have not despaired of anything."

General Assembly on Saturday that the State of North Korea has not seen "the starting point" from the U.S. for the early stages of elimination of weapons in North Korea.
Instead, he said, America has developed obstacles that are aimed at increasing pressure.
Trump had a optimistic attitude in his public address.
"We continue well with North Korea," said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have developed good cooperation."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim have brought good results - to stop rocket trials, assisting in the release of captives and assisting in the return of the corpse of the American forces.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
It is very easy to be a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this field full of, we would have 200 people standing there," Trump said, Stretching out the finger in the crowd that was before him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes across the Island, Kill Hundreds of People
After the earthquake in the island of Lombok, for example, non-governmental organizations were told they were not required.
Even though more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok had been transferred, there is no national catastrophe declared, a requirement that is required to stimulate international support.
In most cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they don’t ask international support, and that’s a challenge”. Ms. Sumbang said.

Although residential tabernacles due to the effect of tsunami have been built in Aceh, it is not widely found in coastal areas.
The real lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was present, can be contributed to the disaster.
In the best, traveling among the most island of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters perform advertising activities.
The hospital ship installed in Lombok for treatment of victims of land earthquake headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the desert area.
President Joko Widodo spent infrastructure deteriorated in Indonesia as the essence of your selected campaigns, and has spent a lot of money in the construction of mainland and railways.
But financial deficiency has become a challenge to the government of Mr. Joko as he approaches the forthcoming elections.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from the government groups, where many Muslims have had conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands transferred to their homes when the groups of Christians and Muslims fought on the street, using swords, and arrows and other fierce weapons.

The statue of Cromwell at Parliament becomes a recent reminder of the disputed 'to re-write history'
His removal will be a worthy right for its similar destruction to the Taliban for the most religious and cultural art of England implemented by its brave European directors.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's proposal to be "recover" and "to re-write history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: "It would not be inevitable in the current debate regarding the withdrawal of statues as an example of Oliver Cromwell out of Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying models in the civil war in Britain was not ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil that Cromwell would be condemned about it's the actions of his grandfather Thomas in the past century.
The interesting representation of Mr. William Hamo Thornecroft for Cromwell is a 19th-century comment evidence and part of the history of a person who many believe they still deserve to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told the newspaper The Sunday: "Cromwell is honored by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a parliamentary advocate due to external pressure, which was the source of imperial leadership.
Whether that is all the correct representation in the presentation of a ongoing historical discussion.
What is clear is that the wars between the 17th century have laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell are personally recognized to represent one wing in those opposition groups.
His success as the Lord the Protector is also worthy of being celebrated and celebrated."
Pig Murder Congratulates and Kills a Chinese farmer
The farmer was attacked and killed by the swine in southwestern China, according to news reports in the area.
The man, who was recognised in the last name of "Yuan," was found dead with an adverse vehemently affected blood in the market hub of Liupanhui province of Guizhou, the Chinese Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to vaccinate the pigs in a pig room on May 20, 2005 in Xining the Qinghai region, China.
He said he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring region of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and she discovered the gate of the neighborhood of pig was clear.
He said that in the swine's house there was a pig that had blood in his mouth.

More than 20 million people watched the case of Brett Kavanagh
More than 20 million people have seen strong evidence on Thursday by the Supreme Court at Brett Kavanagh and a woman accused of sexual harassment that has been seen in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, political crisis continued, while broadcasters in response to the end of Friday events: an agreement carried out by Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake for FBI to conduct investigations over a week of charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% confident that Kavanagh held secret places when he was married and trying to take off clothes at a high school ceremony.
Kavanagh, providing sensitive evidence, said he was 100% sure that it did not happen.
It is likely more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was calculating the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC terminals.
Data was not immediately unavailable from other networks that it sent, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's organization usually has a challenge to count people who are watching office.
In order to keep this in a reasonable perspective, that is a audience that is due to the player's soccer player or Training College awards.
The Fox News Center, whose comment managers have been sincerely supported by the Kavanaugh selection, led all networks to an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day, the Nielsen agency said.
ABC station was second to 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3.1 million, the NBC had 2.94 million, the MSNB had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, the Nielsen agency said.
Ham remained high after the case.
The female was the main theme in the Friday case.
After this average Republican official issued a statement that he would support the gubernatorial nominations, he was captured by CNN and CBS in the morning on Friday, as he tried to board to attend a court case.
He stood up on the ground for a couple of minutes while being rebuked, an event shown directly at the CNN station.
"I stood here in front of you," one woman said.
Do you think he tells the earth the truth?
He was told, "you are strong when many women have no power."
Flake said that his office had reported and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have much to say in the case of the committee.
Advertising and cable networks were all directly focused on several hours later, while the Court Committee voted to advance the appointment of the Senate for full votes.
But Flake said he could do so with the understanding that the FBI could investigate claims against the elect in the next week, which a few of them have been humiliating.
Flake was influenced at a certain level with his friend, Mwadecorat Senator. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
The choice of his own was strong, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to pass the Kavanagh without observation.
President Trump has opened investigations through FBI on claims against Kavanagh.

Volkonán Brushs ashes on Mexico City
Popapettl volcanoes have reached the southern urban areas of Mexico.
The National Abortion Center warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from volcanic erupted within the carburetor and recorded 183 times of gas delivery and ash for more than 24 hours.

Police fighting the Catalans of separation before the anniversary of the independence of voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors joined demonstrators as thousands of protests in order to mark the first year of the Catalans.
A group of rapporters who support the detention housed by the police beat them with an egg and threw them into a color of powder, which caused the clouds of the dust on the streets that would usually have many tourists.
The violence also occurred in that day while the police use their rods to fight.
For more than a few hours the supporting groups which said, "No forget, no forgiveness" confronted the united protesters who were saying, "Spainally."
Four people received treatment for small injuries found in protests, reported local media.
Anxiety remain high in the region that allows you to freedom one year after a referendum on October 1, adopted as unlawful and authority in Madrid but celebrated by the rejecters.
Voters have largely chosen to get free, although the number of people who have appeared lowly while those who opposed themselves ignore the vote significantly.
According to the Catalan authorities nearly 1000 people injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region and cause severe violence.
The groups of supporting freedom had camped all night on Friday to prevent protests to support the national police.
The protests continued but were forced to take a different way.
Narcis Termes, aged 68, an electric technician who attended separate protests and his wife said he had no longer hope for the aspirations of Katalunya to get independence.
The last year we got to live in a better life period.
I looked at my parents happy because they were able to vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite gaining significant victory although too little in the past elections in December, the parties support the Catalan independence have failed to maintain a moment in this year as many leaders known as exiles for self-interesting or in detention await the case for the referendum and later notice of independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old car technician recording police protests on his phone, said the crisis was caused by politicians from both sides.
"Anxiety continue to grow more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans in the pre-trial jail since last year, announced that he would sit for a seat in the European Parliament next year.
To stand as a candidate for the elections for the European Parliament is the best way to reject the backflow of democratic values and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga Board pays Livingston’s 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first grill for Livingston made sure the victory
Livingston's crushed levels caused the failure of Steven Gerrard for the second time in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Munga is the result that separated between both teams as Gary Holt team moving and hold the second position similar to Hibernian.
The Gerard team remains without winnings in the foreign matches in this Premier League and will face the leaders Hearts, who are ahead of them for eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will be the inhabitants of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston has added a number of matches that have failed to be six in the bridge, where the coach Holt has not yet failed since taking place in Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lacks space against at leastless guests
The Holt team should be long before installing, with their automatic attack game causing Rangers problems of all kinds.
Scott Robinson was able to find a place but missed the focus on his previous target in front of the goal, then Alan Lighthow would only be able to beat the ball out after a breakout in order to meet the head ball from Craig Halkett.
Hosts did not appear to allow Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could distract the guests using the plug-in balls.
And it’s through that way where they were able to install the log.
Rangers were punished for the headman and Livingston struggled to catch the Beast, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined him to give a chance, who touched and shut the goal from the center of the box.
At that time, Rangers had controlled the ownership of the ball but failed to penetrate the defense castle of the home team and the gate Liam Kelly will not be hampered for a long period of game,
That trend continued in the second half, though Alfred Morelos had Kelly to save her grandson.
Scott Pittman was prevented from scoring and the legs of the door of the Rangers Allan McGregor and Litghow appointed the ball out after another game of Livingston's pub.
Attacks continued to wake up on the Livingston team’s box and continued removal, when two penalty claims - after Halkett hit the Glenn Middleton player, and another related to handheld the ball - it was neglected.
''A wonderful' from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont’s BBC Stadium in Tony Macaroni
Good job and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had the best game and continue to exceed the expectations and by continuing to climb up on the table.
Their playing style and the team has not changed since returning to the main league, but many compliments go to Holt in a way that has brought team together from his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett contributed to the enormous size, well owned the back defenses with the most favorable order, while Munga gave them activities every time Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the whole match.
Rangers lacked motivation, however.
Just as they have been good sometimes under Gerrard, they were under such standards.
They missed the last touch in the gate - it's once we were able to create a chance to get to the goal of the home team - and that's a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves among the tables.
Erdogan receives a separate emotion in Cologne
There was a smile and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) while Turkish leaders and Germany mourned over the mouth in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit to President Erdogan Germany - which aims to fix the relationships between the two NATO partners.
They differ in matters including human rights, freedom of media and access to Turkey for the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish nationals outside Turkey.
The police mentioned security reasons that a total of 25,000 people did not gather in front of the mosque, but many followers appeared in the nearest areas to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors opposed Erdogan - most of them of the Kurd - also made their voices heard, denounced the Erdogan’s policies and decision of the German government to welcome him to the country.
The two-dimensional demonstrations indicate a division on the view of the president who looks like a hero for some German Turkish and was scandalized by others as a dictator.

Trump says Kavanagh 'was shown, selfish and anger' of the Macedonians
"The vote for Judge Kavanagh is a referendum to reject the tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling Summit, Virginia West.
Trump said that Kavanagh "showed greed and anger" of the Democratic Party during all his selection process.
Kavanagh testified before the Parliament on Thursday, with power and emotionally rejecting claims from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were young.
Ford also witnessed in cases about the woman’s claim.

Hundreds of people killed in an earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia and the number of people died to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many were asked when big waves came into the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami shaken the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to the beach on the town of Palu on Friday when the six-meter-long waves hit dry land by night and attacked and destroyed everything in existence.
Tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 sizes.
"When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were affected," Sutopo Purwo Ngroho, a spokesman for the disaster prevention agency in Indonesia BNPB said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunamis did not come alone, when it had read cars, logs, houses, affected everything on the ground," said Ngoro, adding that tsunami had traveled to the sea open at the 800 kph (497 mph) before attacking the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid tsunami and save themselves, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 stations in Palau.
The aerial photos of the disaster reflected many damaged buildings and shops, the bridges were overthrown and sinked by a mosque surrounded by water.
Small vibrations continued to be heard in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was heard in an area whereabouts 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s assessment and application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that energy produced by a large Friday earthquake was about 200 times stronger than Hiroshima bomb at the Second World War.
The city's geography, which are now available at the end of a narrow minute can be triggered by a tsunami increase, said.
Ngoro explained the situation of destruction that the "wide" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were destroyed.
. Some bodies of victims were found stranded on the backsided buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 others were lost.
Ngoro said injuries and damage can be greater along the coast of 300 kms (190 miles) north of Palu, a place called Donggala, which is close to the earthquake.
Communication "disputed completely without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 living people there," the Red Cross agency said, adding that volunteers and volunteer providers were heading towards affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be worse," it said.
The organization on Saturday was strongly criticized for not knowing that tsunami had attacked Palu, although the leaders said waves came short after a warning.
In a non-professional video shared in social media, a man in the top floor of the building can be heard shouting for a tsunami healings approaching to people in the continent.
Within a few minutes the water waves arrive on the coast and carry the buildings and vehicles.
Reuters could not guarantee once this video.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused an electric waste in a wide area that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo aircraft and aids from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those who were evacuated still need food and other basic needs.
The town’s airport is just open for relief efforts and will remain locked up to October.
President Joko Wido was scheduled to visit rescue stations in Palu on Sunday.
The number of those who died from Indonesia's Tsunamis Over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala were secure in the city of Pallu, where employees protect themselves in the tabernacle placed outside their office, they went through the scenes of great damage along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they saw many damaged houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though support groups started providing relief activities, some complained that extensive foreign workers were blocked from travelling in Palu.
According to Indonesia’s laws, funds, facilities and workers from abroad can only begin entering a pandemic to be national.
That has not been done yet.
"It is still a regional pandemic," said Alia Arrian, a spokesman for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"As soon as the government said, "Yes, this is a national pandemic," we can open international support but there is no condition."
On the second night, when the city of Palu emerged after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of those who had escaped were hoping that their loved ones would be able to become a miracle in their myths without natural hopes.
On Saturday, a young boy was found from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue saved the woman who had been married for two days and her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the national football coach of the Indonesian umbrella, had taught two of players to fly to an umbrella that lost for Asian Games, which was completed this month in Indonesia.
Some who were stuck at Roa Hotel, together with Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“As a leader in the fields of the fly of the umbrella, I have my emotional burden,” she said.
Mr. Gendon explained how, several hours after a statement about Roa Hotel spread among the participants in an umbrella jump game, he had sent a WhatsApp message to the competitors of Palu, who were engaged in a beach concert.
His message, however, showed one gray symbol, rather than two blue symbols.
"I think that the message was not read," he said.

Kanye West: A recovery artist turns his name into a Ye
Kökanye West is changing its name to be - Ye.
Speaking on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The best known creature like Kanye West."
West, 41, called the name of the joke of Ye for a while and used it as the head of his eighth album, published in June.
These changes occur before the appearance of Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yadhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the period who canceled for the " emotional reasons" a farmer said.
Although the abbreviation of his current academic name, West has previously stated that the term has its religious significance.
I believe ‘ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, addressing the name of his album and producer of Big Boy’s radio program.
Therefore I am you, I am we, it is us.
It changed from Kanye, which refers to the only person, and only He - to be an example of our good, evil, confusion of us, everything.
That album is more like what we are.”
He is one of the most popular philosophers who changed their names
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preferences for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West participant, JAY-Z, has also been obliged to use his name with a lower or lower line with it.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use host against civilians
The Vice President of Mexico Manuel Lopez has never promised to use a military base against civilians as the country is about to commemorate 50 years since the murderous bloodshed against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "never don't use the army to deal with the people of Mexico."
The military shot at a peaceful demonstration in the building on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people when the left-wing students were rooted in South America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to students and open free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join the criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of A.I.
While China is more engaged in innovative intelligence, the United States should double the amount of money spent in the research, said investor and professional AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The feedback comes after far units of the U.S. government delivers ads about AI, even though the United States generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China launched its plan last year: and it intends to be the number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Adding double AI budget will be a good start, given that all other countries are behind the United States and we are looking for new innovation in AI," Lee said.
Increased funds can increase double the success of the future AI will be held in the United States, Lee told CNBC in the interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers:: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which is invested in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University created an AI-grade Othello series and later hosted in Microsoft Research and the president of the Google branch of China.
Lee accepted that US government technology competitions like the Robotic Organization in the Comprehensive Defense Research Programme and asked to know what competition would be, to help identify future professionals.
Researchers in the United States should often perform additional tasks to obtain government aid, Lee said.
"Not China adopts professional leaders, it is companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think green cards should be provided directly to PhD students in AI," said.
The Chinese Country Committee released its Development Programme in Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funds for people in educational institutions similar to how the Natural Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funds to U.S. researchers, but academic excellence is low in China, Lee said.
In early this year, the U.S. Defense Department established a Collaboration Center in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from the industry and the White House appointed the creation of the Case Committee in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a 2 billion dollars investment in the program called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently offers more than 100 million dollars every year in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. law that wanted to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence has not gradually struck out for several months now.
Macedonians poll about the country's name change
The people of Macedonia filed a referendum on Sunday regarding the change of its name as “the Republic of North Macedonia,” which could solve the conflict of many years and Greece that prevents its membership request in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a region called Macedonia, maintains that the country's neighboring name in the north represents a claim to its region and has opposed the request of the country to be a member of NATO and EU.
The two governments agreed in June according to a new proposed name, but national opponents say the changes will constitute the tribal recognition of many people in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in a referendum and the electoral campaign has caused a claim of 50% voters needed for a referendum to be correct.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO's membership by the EU and agree to Greece."
Gender-changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a bond to be paid to be accepted into organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created due to the distribution of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us," said Olivera Georgivska 79 at Skopje.
Although it is not legalized, enough members of Parliament have said they will support the voting results to make it more seriously.
Change name will require support and two-thirds of the votes in the assembly.
The country's electoral body says there had been no reports of law violation by the hour of the afternoon.
However, the number of voters was only 16 percent, compared to 34% in the previous elections in 2016 when 66% of the registered voters voted.
""I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, the voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia to change the name of the country that will open up a way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, was organizing a small platform and organizing the seats in front of the tents created by those who will oppose the referendum.
"We join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in love, not through the back door to be pressured" said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our respect.
If you do not want to register as Macedonia, we can join others as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia partnership."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will bring highly needed investments for Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I believe a large number will support it because 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that the results of "yes" will be "prove of the future."
A review study published on Monday by the Policy Research Institute said between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in a referendum - under the required rate.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian Telma TV, found that 57 percent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Among them, 70 percent said they would vote for yes.
In order for the referendum to raise the number of voters should be 50% and one vote.
The failure of a referendum will represent the first major blow to the Western government since it took over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City spinning all of the Brighton castle and scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling caused the patrons of the Brighton pill in the match that Manchester City won 2-0 Saturday in the field of Etihad in Manchester, the UK.
Aguero made it seem much easier when he scored a goal in 65 minutes.
An Argentine attacker got a passport in the field and established a series.
He passed between three banks of the Brighton, before puberty in the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed him into the edge of one bank and pushed him to the side of the Brighton gate box.
And he cast it without on his left hand, and found Sterling.
The British attacker used his first touch in the box and restored the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to orbit the gate of Brighton Mathew Ryan and the plight into the right side of the train.
"Aguero faces certain problems in his feet," the City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
"We talked about him playing 55 minutes, 60.
That was what happened.
We were fortunate that he kept the goal at that time."
But it's a Sterling who gave the team of Sky Blues the first control in the championship of the Premier League.
The boat was 29 minutes shut.
Aguero received a ball within the Brighton area in the attack.
He slapped the beautiful hair through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched a few times before giving Sterling to the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues attacker touched the ball into the net before he began to celebrate.
City are fighting Hofenheim in the Champions League match at 6:55pm Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The Scherzer wants to be a destroyer against. Rockies
While Nationals were already removed from the nominations, he did not have other reasons to impose at the other beginning.
But the Schzer who has a lot of competition hopes to be a barrier on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still major effects in the nominations for Rockies, who are proud to have one game that have not played against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
Rockies won the chance to play a chase for the 52nd win against National Friday night, but still look for the first crown in the bridge.
Although we do not play anything, at least we can play a hard game based on the situation will be here at Denver and the crowd and the other team will be playing at the highest level in each level that I will face this year.
Why don’t I want to be competing at that level?”
National yet have not announced players who will start the game on Sunday, but they say they have loved to allow the Szer to allow the ball to the situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34rd game, made an exercise of firing on Thursday and will be aired on his day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington's right hand holder uses 18-7 and is average of 2.53 and 300 withdrawal points for worst in 220/3 km this season.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred to in an indirect manner facing his elect Brett Kavanagh at the High Court when he spoke of the importance of Republicanism in the election of representatives.
"All the achievements we have suffered are at risk in November.
Five weeks from the most important elections in our lives.
This I am one of the greatest choices, great -- I do not sing but in another way I run true and that’s why I’m around the world to hit the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible group of Macedonians, you see what they do right now.
And they have decided to take authority using any possible means, you can see greed, perversion.
They do not care about people who are hurt, who are wrong to obtain authority and control, what they want is authority and control, we cannot give them.”
He said, the protestors are interested in "resisting and preventing."
And you can see it in the past four days,” he said, calling the Macedonians to be "mysteries and nobles and liars."
He named a member of the Senate Court Committee who is Dianne Feinstein in the name, which made the audience mature.
"Remember his answer?
Did you reveal documents in an inappropriate way?
Uh, uh, what is.
No, not, I waited one - that was a very weak language of the body - the worst language I have seen.”
The Lebanese Party is no longer inclusive church.
It does not tolerate independent thoughts
When Momentum activists in the local party voted to get me away, it was not so amazing.
After all, I am one in the line of the Lebanese MPs to be told that we will not be sure - all in say our thoughts.
My companion in the assembly Joan Ryan was treated so because he stood in his rebellion against the discrimination of the Jews.
In my case, a proposal to remove me from a failure to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of relevant economic policy, regarding the security of the nation, regarding the issue of Europe, the passage is that such issues are similar to what Jeremy differs from previous leaders.
The statement to a Lebanese summit on Friday stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and impact."
For more than eight years such as the local Lebanese MP, the on Friday Night of the GC has been including it at all.
Sadly today, it has not been similar to many meetings and promises of “s tenderness, generosity” has been forgotten for a long time if, in fact, had begun.
It has become clear that different views are not accepted in the Lebanese party and all opinions are considered well as they are accepted by the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy was a leader, as my partner who I thought we were sharing the same political attitude began to change the ideas I would never agree to – whether it is about national security or one market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say - that follows is abusive in social media and will not be selected, I will reject the politics of the central wing, and tell me that I should not be in the Lebanese party.
And it is not a situation that I have experienced alone.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than others because the views directed to me are political.
I highly respect the skills and statements of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or colours every day but never disappoint.
One of the things that break the heart in today’s politics is how violence levels are considered common.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Lebanese party should promote the culture of patience.
The fact is that we are no longer an integrated church and for every discussion of the "no-confidence" or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes much more narrow in the integration.
I’ve got a lot of advice over the last two years being encouraged to calm down, I don’t speak so much and that “I’ll be right.”
But I did not come into politics to do so.
Since I joined the 32-year-old Leba association as a school student, due to the release of the government of Thatcher which left my full school class nearly collapsed, I have strived to fight the best public care for those who need it – whether a local or state minister.
I have not hidden the variety of my politics, including the previous elections.
There is no one in the Eastern Nottingham that could be confused about the attitude in the policy and places of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who brought forward the debate on Friday, all that I say is that when the country is approaching to leave the European Union famous Brexit, the action that will hurt our families, businesses and services, I don’t understand the desire to lose my time and strength to discuss my credibility to the leader of the Lebanese party.
But in fact my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it’s for citizens in my area, whether members of the Lebanese party or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no amount of withdrawal threats or political cracks will prevent what I believe is for the best interests for all of you.
Chris Leslie is an Eastern Nottingham MP
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's underestimated team will still replace the first on the table
Two attempts at the last time may have changed to a certain end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr was qualified to win in this highly anticipated Tent League match.
Now they guide the table, the only team that has not failed.
Finally, it was their excellent protection, and the use of their positions, which helped the team at home and coach Peter Murchie had the right to satisfaction.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and yet have not failed, so I must rejoice," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Hongera for Ayr, used their best place to be quiet."
An attempt by Anderson 14 minutes, bound by Frazier Climo, set the Ayr forward, but an yellow card to the team of Scotland Rory Hughes, released for the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have so many players and Jason Baggot got a trial that was not closed.
Climo added Ayr's leadership in a penalty, just before the rest time, locked up and then completed a trial alone and made a 17-5 mark for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, closed by Baggot, reducing the leadership in five points.
Then the game was stopped over time after a dangerous wound on Ruharid Knott, who was carried away by the game being reinstated, Ayr added its leadership in the attempt to Stafford McDowall, wrapped by Climo.
The deputy captain of Ayr Blair Macpherson was then given an yellow and again, Melrose used the opportunity to have one more player and fasted at the attempt of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a strong period.
The home team took control again, however, when the Struan Hutchinson was acquired an yellow card to play badly Clim without the ball and from the line of a penalty out, MacPherson scored due to a severe attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, how he did after the game began again, after Kyle Rowe collects David Armstrong and cheered Henry and close the fifth test to the home team.

‘The sea is our’: Bolivia which does not hope that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Pirates patrol at the headquarters of the sea in La Paz.
The public buildings have mounted a blue flag as the sea.
Sea stations from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are written: "The sea is our right.
It returns is responsible."
Throughout the harbor-free Bolivia, the coastline tomb lost to Chile in the 19th-century resource crisis is still clear – just as the desire to travel again in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps the hope is now much higher for years, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
The "Bolivia has speed, spirit of unity and stability and has truly a positive attitude for the results,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
The majority of Bolivian citizens will view ICJ’s decision on a larger screen across the country, hoping that the courts in The Hague will make a decision that accepts Bolivia’s claim – after decades of appropriate negotiations - Chile will be forced to discuss the way to reach the sea.
Evo Morales, the original president of Bolivia - who is facing strong confrontation in the coming year - also has much related Monday's decision.
We are very close to coming back to the Pacific Ocean," he swore by the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is a little likelihood that the court will make a decision in Bolivia – and that there will be a very small change even if it decides so.
The Dutch-based organization has no mandate to quote the Chilean territory for other countries, and it says that it cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations expected to be done.
The decision of ICJ will be issued only six months after the last debate pointed out that the case "not an intermediary" said Paz Zárate, the Chilean expert in international law.
And apart from developing the hopes of Bolivia, four years ago can be reversed.
"The issue of access to the sea is misused by current Bolivia administration," said Zárate.
The political words of Morales have ended the good faith of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue with talks, but it will be very difficult to make discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, an Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decisions were very urgent.
Monday will give Bolivia a wonderful opportunity to unlock a new era of connection with Chile" and the opportunity to " end 139 years of varying for common benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - is still one of the most popular presidents in South America - he used the marine issue as a political stream.
"Bolivia will never disappoint her with the right to access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to realize that we need to go ahead."
North Korea says that the withdrawal of nuclear weapons is impossible unless it has faith with the United States
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation will never remove his nuclear weapons first if he cannot have faith with Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow the promises made during a meeting in Singapore among opposition leaders.
His comments come when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be closely re-establishing a nuclear diploma that had not been achieved for more than three months after a Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "little dreams" that developing obstacles and U.S. opposition to the news that ends the Korean War will ever make the North as weak.
Washington is afraid to accept information without Pongyang first to make necessary action to eliminate weapons.
Kim and US President Donald Trump all want a second meeting.
But there is a great doubt that Pyongyang considers the move to withdraw weapons that the country considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting Kim-Trump.

John Edward: Language skills are important for international citizens
The independent schools of Scotland continue to maintain a professional skill record and this has continued in 2018 for another set of best test results, which is strengthened by personal and collective success in sports, arts, music and other social efforts.
With an increase of over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the District’s Self-Service Council in Scotland (a popular CIS), strive to provide a better level of service to students and parents.
The independent schools are aimed at preparing their students for higher and higher education, careers they choose and their position as international citizens.
As an educational industry that can create and implement a specific school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular with the school-loving academics.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, that's going to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes into his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can’t rely on English only when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
Due to the recent test results of this year, we can see that languages govern the league table with high standards in private schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages received a high score of A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students received A high Mark in the Mandarin language and 72 percent for those learning German, 69 percent for those learning French and 63% of Spanish also got A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that children and young people will need in their future.
Language now, as the selected subject, are taken at the same level as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
Research conducted by the British Commission in 2014 found that one of the reasons the employers said they were challenging to fill vacancies, 17 percent was associated with a lack of language skills.
So more and more, language skills are important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With so many job opportunities needed language, this knowledge is important in the global world.
Regardless of the profession that one chooses, if they have learnt the second language, they will find more real opportunities in the future have such knowledge of life.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries you will put someone who speaks a language away from the competition.
According to the Study of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well in order to develop a conversation in French language which is the only English language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language training is now important for current children.
Having many languages, especially those of the developing countries, will give children a better chance to find meaningful employment.
In the skirt, each school will have a different language that teaches.
Several schools will focus on more modern languages, where some will teach languages that seem more important to the UK in the near future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, there will always be several languages to choose from in private schools, as well as training professionals in this field.
Certificates are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with required skills, regardless of their future careers.
It cannot be opposed to being at this time, in international business mode, that the language remains very important for the future of the country, so this should be shown in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "global communication skills."
Schools independently continue to provide this option, diversity and quality to the youth of Scotland.
Il fat bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Private Schools Council in Scotland

You will be the first of five meetings that are scheduled to take place next week, including stand in areas that have many followers including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote for proof if it is still suspended on the final position of the Supreme Court, Trump is aimed at creating support in elections since the Republicans are at the risk of losing the Parliament when the vote will be held in November.

Trump's meeting at Wheeling, Virginia West has been scheduled 1 evening. Eastern times tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the comments of Trump's West TV conference online via live flow on YouTube.
There is a possibility Trump will discuss the case on the election of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanough, which has brought a lot of concern about the sexual abuse that led to the suspension of the Senate’s referendum on the week when FBI is conducting investigations.
But the aim of this series of meetings is to call for the Republican candidates in the November elections to gain greater popularity.
Thus, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings in the coming week aims to strengthen volunteers and supporters with the Republican Party trying to protect and expand the majority of seats in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.

Ryder's Cup 2018: The U.S. team will show a chance to fight against and maintain hope towards a single person's game on Sunday
After the three rounds on the one hand, the game of two players for Saturday afternoon can be the excitement that the Ryder's Cup gets hit
The trend of the abduction is a totally designed concept of games but which players truly believe and even more in such a race
So they will hear where the speed is going now?
"They had six points and now are four, so we take it as little as I think," said Jordan Spieth after the conclusion day.
Europe have a better chance, of course, they are in front of four points, remaining twelve polished ones.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have additional strength and have a lot to encourage them, also taking into account the game of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together the whole day and everyone boasts three of the four points.
Spieth has been dangerous from the beginning of the game to the hole of the game and leads to a model.
Many of these celebrations increased when his turn continued, insert the ball into the shaft and balance it when he and Thomas had two marks after two turns.
Its rubber blow to the shaft won a 15 hole match and gained a lot of fun noise, which shows you believe that the US team has not yet died.
"In fact you must diligently comply with your own match," Spieth said.
Now that’s just what these players remain doing now.
18 holes wait for them to show them.
Only players with more symbols than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an unforgettable story of Ryder's Cup.
The incredible pair from Europe has four points between the four and they have not done any mistakes.
The "Moliwood" is the only pair that did not double the morning ball, but they also avoided the ball in the morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine pits on Friday morning.
The quality, and how their strengths appear to increase among them and the crowd manifests that these players will give the highest contest on Sunday and perhaps no other popular players are able to win for the European field of Le Golf National as it is not Fleetwood or Moliri.
Well if all do this at the same time on different pits.
It is very early to discuss about victory for Europe, however.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson agreed accordingly with Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in the two game against the two, when he created pairs with Alex Noren.
The additional ball and two more balls in the early nine holes set the Spaniards and the Laster in a situation that was hard from.
Sunday, however, no one can collect you in a situation that you will enter.
The two game against the two is very exciting to look closely at the reason for collaboration between pairs, counseling that do not provide with advice and how the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has made it even better as a team so far and took great leadership toward the last day but this period of pair has also shown that the U.S. team has a willingness to fight some of which, especially those in the United States, did doubt.
Europe lead to 10-6 in the Ryder's last Cup
Europe will have good positions in the last day of the Ryder’s Cup after winning in a pair match with four balls over 10-6 balls against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina's pair inspired the game with a double victory against Tiger Woods appeared to be overwhelmed and conveyed the total of their scores to the moment on Le Golf National to be four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, which struggles to pray with the cup that lost in the Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States to be destroyed in the game of four morning balls, and won the 3-1 series.
The United States made more resistance in pairs and won two matches, but they could not remove the deficit.
The Jim Furyk team needs eight points from the 12 Sundays to stay with the cup.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win the four consecutive scores while he and Moliri, who are called "Moliwood" after the end of the exciting week became the second pair to win the four points from their open matches in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating the Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls they collaborated well to win Wood with the American Bryson December 5 and 4.
Woods, who was back in both the matches on Saturday, showed some nice matches but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in a match of four balls and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who relaxed at the match of four in the morning, returned to cooperate with Henrik Stenson in the match of 2 and 1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - listed in the first and three positions in the world.
Europe did not find everything though it was good, with an interesting wind in the west of Paris.
The winner of the main Cup Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the criteria for two points on Saturday.
They received a 2nd and 1 victory against Jon Ramh and Ian Poulter of Spain in four balls and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the game of pair after losing two early holes.
It is only twice in the history of the Ryder’s Cup where the team has managed from the back to four points in one game, although the Furyk team only needs to get out of uniforms to pray with the cup.
After being in the second place for two days, however, the struggle to win on Sunday will appear to be far from them.
North Korea says ‘is impossible’ will eliminate weapons without belief that others will do what they should.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions were further undermines the US belief and no means in the country could eliminate its nuclear weapons without the rest of them should be under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea had taken “good measures of good faith” last year, such as stopping nuclear and crackdown attempts, breaking up a nuclear test center and promising to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see any similar answer from the United States," he said.
Without any belief in the United States there will be no faith in our national security in such situations and no way we will remove our weapons first without doing what they have to do."
When Ri stressed in North Korea's resistance to Washington’s "action" approach by eliminating nuclear weapons where North Korea could earn a small move, it was reported to have refused to eliminate nuclear weapons in terms of how Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current US President and North Korea leader Singapuri on June 12, while Kim promised to work to "remove nuclear weapons at the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure North Korea security.
North Korea has been seeking formal solutions to the 1950-53 war, but the United States says Pyongyang must remove its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also refused calls to stop international sanctions against North Korea.
The "America emphasizes" first the removal of nuclear weapons" and adds pressure levels to achieve their goal in compelling manner and even resisting the "war-end ad"," Ri said.
The "view that obstacles may undermine is impossible dreams from people who ignore us.
But the problem is that the ongoing barriers continue to disagree.
"Ri did not refer to the plans of the second meeting between Kim and Trump, who the U.S. leader touched in the United States earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of elimination of nuclear weapons would be South Korea and not the United States, the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula would not be in this miserable state."
However, the speech of Ri was somewhat different from last year, when he told the United States General Assembly that the move towards North Korea would not have been avoided after the "B.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last threatened " completely destroying" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action to eliminate weapons, but said a huge task should still be done and the obstacles should still remain in North Korea to remove the weapons of the bees.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying "If it will take two years, three or five months - no.
China and Russia say that the United Nations Security Council should keep Pyongyang for the action that took.
However, U.S. Secretary of State’s Foreign Affairs told the Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the sanctions for the Security Council must proceed in detail and without fail until we have complete, final and verifiable withdrawal of beneous weapons.”
Collectively, the Security Council has stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for nuclear programmes and Pyongyang rockets.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress has been made, but only within a few hours in North Korea accused him of giving "the criminal provisions."
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a rocket facility and also a nuclear weapon station if the United States takes a “related action.”
He said Kim had told him that "the related steps" he wanted was a security guarantee that Trump promised him to strengthen relations with Washington.
Harvard students trained a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new study at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat a culture of self-organizing the whole night's for coffee support.
The specialist found students in one university in the world have no basic knowledge about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professional at Brigham Hospital and Women, created the subject, which believes that it is the first type of the United States.
. He was invited to form a subject after giving a talk about how adequate sleep affects the training.
'At the end of the talk, one girl came to me and said: 'Why am I told you these things now, in my last year?”
He said no one ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that was amazing," he told the Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been first introduced this year, explains the students the basics about how good sleep style helps in professional performance and sports as well as improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barrera, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and the university’s executive director, said the university decided to establish the subject after learning that students had missed a lot of sleep during the week.
The study that takes around the clock involves a series of interactive activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click on for coffee, curtains, shoes and books to be explained about the effects of coffee and light and how the performance of sports are affected by the lack of sleep and the importance of sleep schedule.
In some places, participants are told how long sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart shock, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map of college and interactive, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know this lesson does not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke, 'Profes Czeisler added.
Culture of pride in 'dropping' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and pressure for continuous students means the lack of sleep was a continuous problem.
Make sure that you get enough sleep, with good quality, you should be a ‘secret weapon’ of student to cope with stress, tiredness and rebelliousness, said – even avoid weight gain, because the lack of sleep makes sense to be in reservation and make you hungry at all times.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who learns physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the subject, after taking part in his classes last year during his first year in Harvard.
He said the subject opened her eyes and gave her a commitment to create a whole college subject.
The next step, hopes, is to apply for all students who make a session matching before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should focus on keeping the alarm during sleep as well as the alarm during the wake and understanding the effects of ‘blue light’ provided by electrical screens and LED lighting, which can destroy the brain clock and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Vegetables Board
Rangers failed again in another alien game when the late Dolly Munga hit the team of Steven Gerrard found to be overtaken by 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was planning to get the first win since the 4-1 victory against St. Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team caused Gerard to win for a second time in 18 games as a manager and left his team behind the League leaders of Ladbrokes, Hearts.
Manga scored seven minutes before retreat with Rangers never looked like it would sync.
When Rangers come down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs up to the third position and they are only behind Hibernate for the diversity of the bricks.
And there may be more problems with Rangers after the defender Calum Spence needs treatment after being injured on the head with something corrupted from Rangers followers.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that scored Ayr in half the Betfred Cup final.
Holt, on the other hand, spent all 11 players who found uniform against the previous Hearts and will be happy with how her team was prepared well encountered their opponents every time.
Rangers possessed more ball but Livingston well when they got the ball.
They had to close only a second minute when the first Mega Ball gave him a chance Scott Pittman to the Allan McGregor gate but the link throwed the ball out.
The handball from Kegan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett but his companion in defense Alan Lighthow could just beat out of the goal.
Rangers took control but their game seemed kind but not confident when they approached the closing area.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to earn a penalty 15 minutes after being hit by Steven Lawless but a friend Steven Thomson said the game continued even after the claim of the Redeemer.
Rangers was able to beat two slashes in the goal during the first half but the old Ibrox Liam Kelly's protector will not be much troubleed by the head ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak man from Ovie Ejaria.
When Livi's goal in 34 minutes was not due to the usual game, no one can deny that they deserve it.
Again Rangers failed to confront the deputy ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher turned the ball to Scott Robinson, who was established by the ball towards the move and scored.
Gerrard made a decision during a break and switch Coulably with Ryan Kent and the action was about to get the results when the link ladened the ball Morelos but Kelly fled from his place and prevented the ball.
But Livingston continued to distract guests and made them play how they want, with Lightow and Halkett, beating the ball in another place.
The Holt team could add the log in the last minutes but McGregor was consistent with blocking Jacobs before Lhgow beat the ball out of the head.
external-link Rangers player Glenn Middleton had another claim to a penalty for the last minutes when they confronted Jacobs but again refer Thomson dismissed a request away.
Year’s salary: Geiger Counter device inventor
And now a page from our annual salary of the year of "Sunday": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continue to be a member of the late Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a way to discover and measure radiation, an innovation that was ultimately designed to be created by a device known as Geiger Counter.
The foundation of science since then, Geiger Counter kit became popular in the culture of popularity as in the 1950s of "Bell of Coronado," composed of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that in this world?"
Rogers: "It is a Co Counter Geiger, used to discover radiation mining, such as the uranium.
When you put these materials on the scalp, you can hear the effect of the atom provided by the buyer inside the minerals.”
Evans: " Say, I have begun to voice now!"
Hans " Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his birth of 63 year.
But the innovation that is called by its name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system ‘see’ bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system ‘see’ bad cells and prevent them
Vaccines train the immune system to identify bad cells as part of the treatment
Method involves excluding protective cells from the patient, changing them into the lab
Then they can ‘see’ a protein that is popular in many cancers and then be reinstalled.
experimental vaccine shows good results in patients with distant cancer.
One vaccine-treated woman, which teaches an immune system to identify bad cells, was able to treat his ovaris cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves cooling the immune cells from the patient, changing them into the lab so that they can "see" the common protein to multiple cancers called HER2, and then setting those cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very reliable vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovari, lungs and gastrointestines, Prof Berzofsky explained.
Such a method of taking protective cells from patients and “ teaching them” how to target cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has begun a Sustainable Justice with Anti-Money Trump, wearing a cap, after appearing in the SNL period.
It was not going well.
Kanye West was married in a studio during the Saturday Night Live period after a high performance that praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be office in 2020.
After the exhibition of his third song for that night, called Ghost Town where he was dressed in a cap written on Make America Great, he began to rebuke the Macedonians and promised support to Trump.
And again, when I speak to the god, he says, 'How can you love Trump, he who is racism?'
Well, if I would have been rebellious about racism I would leave America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL session began with a brief instruction included Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh’s testimony before the Senate Committee in connection with allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the event was not announced, the West’s content was uploaded in social media by the proprietor Chris Rock.
It is not known as Rock tried to mock West for the printing.
Also, West was complaining to the audience that he had a tough time before entering the platform related to his hat.
They wronged me behind the platform.
They said, ‘Do not go there and the cap.’
They wronged me!
And then they said that I am in a situation that I have sinked, “said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: "What do you want to see in the place of drowning?" saying that he will put on my brave hero's cap, because this means you can't tell me what I should do.
Try love.”
His comments have caused a break at least twice from the audience and the SNL staff seemed to be ashamed, the Variety Station reported, and one person in the post: "The whole studio went silent entirely."
West had been brought to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose old boyfriend, Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West was amazing when he sang the song of I Love it, dressed in a water bottle of Perrier.
West was backed by the conservative leader TPUSA, Candace Turner who published tweet: “For one of the most brave people: ANANET BY THE COMMITING AND THE MOTHER.”
But the host of the chat Karen Hunter published a tweet that West was just “shows his attitude and that it’s a good thing.”
But I choose another person (by buying his music or making it support his "art") who believes he agrees with spreading the beliefs that are dangerous to my community.
He has freedom.
Even we also, "add.
Before the time, the baker announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he would now be “as well known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Piddy.
The colleague, Snoop Dogg has replaced and called Snoop Lion and of course a late Prince, changed his name as a sign and then an original artist like Prince.

HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health leaders say.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
A lot of new scenarios were caused by sex, and signaling changes from the past.
Typically, HIV spread rapidly in other parts of China due to blood exchange.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way was reduced to zero, China’s health leaders said at a meeting in the Yuann province.
. However, the year after year, the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown to 100,000 people.
HIV infection through sex is a chronic issue in the LGBT community in China.
The same-sex will in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBTI people is said to be very high.
Because of national conservative values, studies have predicted that 70-90% men in the same sex eventually grow women.
A lot of disease infection is due to the possibility of using immunity during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV medicine as part of the effort to respond to this issue.
Maxine Waters denied that his employee exposed the data of GOP senators, rebuked the ‘false risk’ and ‘ plot theory’
U.S. MP Maxine Waters on Saturday denied claims that his employee published three of Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MP.
The demokrat party MP from Los Angeles said the claims were made by the analysts and “the chronic right-wing followers”.
"false, false, and more un meaningless false," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided is meant to include the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, all from Utah.
A statement appeared online on Thursday, was published by a person not known on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel to hear charges of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court’s Supreme Court at Brett Kavanagh.
It happened a few days after the senator accused Kavanagh.
The conservative locations such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identify the source of publications was associated with the Bureau of Waters and provide employee details of the Waters, the Hilli reported.
These non-discrimination assertions are quite false and completely distorted, "Waters continued.
My employee - whose identity, personal information, and its security has been affected due to these claims of deception and lies - he never deals with revealing this information.
These untrue assertions are completely false and completely distorted.”
The statement of the Waters was quickly used online, including former Minister of Information at the White House’s headquarters in Aries Brewers.
"This rejected is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that he does not have the right emotional control in order to become a Member of Parliament.
When someone is accused of what he did not, he should not be angry.
You should not be rebellious.
You should not question the interests of the petitioner.
He should be quiet and in no way.
A "Fleischer appeared as it compares the response to the Waters and the criticism of the Macedonians against Judge Kavanagh, who was accused by critics for the appearance of anger during the hearing of a case on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate through an Republican party seeking to withdraw the Waters in the election of representatives, also published his ideas on Twitter.
"The biggest thing if it's true," said by tweet.
In a statement, Waters said his office had referred to “the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities regarding these false claims.
We will ensure that those who have done this are exposed, “continued,” and that they will be liable for all their actions that corrupt and risk for everyone and all my employees.”
inquirydetail Johnny English Strikes Again - a joke in the detective of Rowan Atkinson
It is common to check the effect of Brexit in any new English-based movie but that does not serve in a series of other comedy films - the battle for Johnny English joke - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Is it a personal joke humor in the topic of how we are moving it will be new opportunities abroad?
At any level, Johnny English’s eye-ling-off, a very moving face has a license to make mistakes again in a second way - the name reflects its most abundant sign that he has been designed for non-English speakers.
He is actually a detective, who despite an incredible claim to be interesting for the interest of Clouseau, the features of Mr Bean and the person who contributed to one of the music themes of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of Olympic in London 2012.
He was first involved as an extraordinary traveler and internationalman Atkinson at the same time engaged in the advertising of Barclay TV that was currently forgotten, leaving as many as have not been interested.
There is one or two thing in this recent JE movie.
I liked to see Johnny English as she approaches the helicopter wearing a traditional weapon suit and pleasure bars shifted over her hat.
A talent of Atkinson in physical delays was manifested here, but humor is shown to be low and unwanted, especially because the film “great” such as 007 and Mission Impossible includes humor as part of it.
The humor looks like you're focusing on children and not adults and depending on me the unique journey of Johnny English is not creative and does not focus on how much the humor of the synthetic film being involved in Bean.
The annual concept is now that the UK is in great trouble.
An online raid has been able to enter the UK's secret network and reveal the identity of all the British spies out at work and wonder the task-up was a very simple role for Kevin Eldon.
In her last time as a proud and self-perception leader and has already been profoundly affected in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing very well for her character that is in line with Teresa May but the story does not help to show these qualities.
Its security advisers inform him that because the identity of each detective is revealed, they must use the retired person.
And that means using Johnny English yourself, who has now been employed as a school teacher at a prestigious school, but teaches non-official training on how to become a secret detective: some of the good humor there, while English teaches a detective similar to the School of Rock film.
English is re-entered by Whitehall for an emergency meeting and connected with former Bough counterparts, reincarnation Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, she is associated with a tower commander, an exciting chance where Vicki Pepperdine is not involved should be.
So the characters that match Batman and Robin but by destroying the things in the Kingdom Secret Service are returning to work and getting along with Olga Kurylenko acting as an absolute proponelist.
At the same time, the prime minister seems to be more involved with the detective of the private master who claims that he can solve all the problems of technology in the UK: Jason Volta, who is commissioned by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey more enjoyable: they make hotel ministers, fire in a luxurious French restaurant; they start violence and go in without permission in the iconic Volta boat; and English is leading to a deck when she is trying to use real estate facilities to learn things inside the Volta boat.
All breaks are undoubtedly removed for the final sequence, but regardless of the influence and concentration included, there are very many characteristics of the children’s sessions in the movie.
Good quality items.
And just as it had other movies in Johnny English I had to be able again: does the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes it right for her gift?
The Lebanese Party has denied that it has a plan for the British to work four days but to be paid for five days.
The Lebanese Party led by Jeremy Corbyn will focus on a strong deal that will continue to work four days a week - but they were paid five days.
The party is allegedly seeking companies to pay the funds saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees for giving them an additional day.
It means employees will have three days to relax - but they will still go home with the same income.
The sources said that the idea ‘profitable’ an economic agenda of the party and plans to strengthen the country for employees.
Working four days a week is supported by the union Centre as a means of employees taking advantage of the flexible economy.
The main source of the Lebanese Party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy audit is expected to be declared before the end of the year.
It will not be done once but four working days are dedicated to the view of the party in syncing the economy for employees and also the overall strategy of the party for the industry.’
The ‘Leba Party will not be the first to suggest such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 campaign for the general elections.
This is currently not supported by all in the Lebanese Association, however.
The Lebanese party spokesperson said: ‘ Four working days a week are not party policy and is not considered by the party.’
Chancellor alternates John McDonnell spent the last week's Leba conference describing his vision of a psychological revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he had a resolution to remove the authorities from the ‘invisible director’ and ‘internationally enriching’ of service delivery companies.
The alternate Chancellor’s plan also means that the current shareholders in the water companies will not be able to recover all their funds because the Lebanese Government can make ‘expensive’ on the basis of recognised errors.
He also confirmed that the plans for placing employees on the board of the company and creating Local Security Fund to provide 10% of the individual companies for employees, who will have the opportunity to obtain an annual allocation of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy described a period of "60 minutes" if the FBI investigation against Kavanagh can change their ideas
The investigation into prosecutions against Judge Brett Kavanagh has delayed the final vote in the Supreme Court for at least one week and has raised a question as the result of the FBI senators to change the ideas of Republican senators to support them.
In an interview announced on Sunday, an "60Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked the senator. Republican John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if FBI could find anything that could lead to change their ideas.
Kennedy seemed more clear than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the case, I said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanagh.
I called him after this had happened, when the claims happened, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was steadfast, obedient, and obedient.”
However, it seems a lot of Graham cannot change.
"I've decided about Brett Kavanagh and will take very serious charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I do not know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused by force, "Graham added, meaning Christine Blasey Ford."
And everyone who was involved could not prove it.
It is 36 years now.
I do not see something new to change."
What Is the World War Festival and Did It So Long?
This Saturday, New York will prepare a World Citizens’ Festival, a music event that includes a fascinating list of stars who are singing and also an interesting message; to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Member’s Festival will take tens of thousands to the Great Lawn region not only enjoy the stars such as Janet Jackson, Card B and Shawn Mendes, but also increasing awareness for the real purpose of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, which said in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a global advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people directly confronting against it.
To get a free event ticket (except if you would like to pay for a VIP ticket), the festival followers had to complete a series of activities, or “do” such as volunteering, send an email to the world leader, call or any other effort to help raise awareness of poverty.
But how has the World War Festival remained 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of awarding people for free concert tickets is the real way to convince people to push the action, or just another “online activist” – people feel as they bring a true difference by signing an online request or sending tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens’ Festival states that it has recorded more than 19 million of its “devices” from its followers to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have pushed the world's leaders to declare the promises and policies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
As early as 2018, this group showed 390 commitments to his actions, at least 10 billion dollars already distributed or donated.
The group estimates the money earned so far that they have directly affected 649 million worldwide.
Some of the important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the partnership of investors and donors in the UK is to help children reach all their potential," promising to give up 35 million to Rwanda to help stop the malnutrition in the country after they receive more than 4,700 tweets from the World Citizens.
With support from the British government, donors, national governments, and World Citizens as you, we can make social injustice no better to become history,” Power Ambassador of Nutrition Tracey Ullman told the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were completed in asking Britain to improve nutrition for mother and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with better nutrition.
In response to the question in the FAQ section and the answers on his website that asked “What makes you think we can end up extreme poverty?”
The citizens of the World War I answered: It will be a long and hard way - sometimes we will fall and defeat.
But, with human rights activists and groups against racism before us, we will succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi Monáe is among the stars that will sing in the event in New York, who the locals will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Marine Army to "block" export of Russian energy - Minister of Interior
Washington can "if needed" to prevent Russian energy sold, including the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia's participation in Syria - especially, where it works with a valid government invitation - it is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are looking for energy markets in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe," it is reported.
And, according to the officer, there are methods and methods to deal with it.
The UN has the potential, along with our Migrants, to ensure that sea paths are open, and, if necessary, to prevent, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zike was addressing members of the incident organized by the Consumer Energy Association, a non-profit group that said it represents the "power of energy" in the United States.
He went on to compare the ways Washington uses to deal with Russia and Iran, and said that these countries are similar.
The "economic option for Iran and Russia is, based on the use and changing fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "with a few skills" and economics based on coal-based oil.
The information arrives when Trump’s administration has been at the mission of increasing its natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very cheap choice for European users.
As a result, the leaders of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "Nord Stream 2," tube which in line with Trump, made Berlin a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nordic Stream 2 billion, which aims to double up the current capacity of 110 billion, is an economic project.
Kremlin says that the majority of Washington's opposition to the project is caused by economic factors and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we do not agree that energy should be a tool to do pressure and that users should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow on September.
The U.S. position has been attributed to Germany, which has proven its commitment to the project.
The German leading agency in the industry, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has urged the United States to avoid the energy policy of the European Union and the two countries between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) said after a recent meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "Checking In" Presidential Candidate in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
external-link Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he could "to look deeper" if he was seeking the presidency after the election of representatives.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would focus on running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and revise our corrupt government and which includes a woman in power,” she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will look into the depth as I will run for the presidency."
Warren spoke to President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city hall, saying he was “leading this country in an inappropriate direction.
"I am very rebellious about what Donald Trump does to our democracy, "he said.
Warren has been extremely speaking to his opposition against Trump and his Supreme Court MP Brett Kavanagh.
In tweet he published on Friday, Warren said “of course we need an FBI investigation before voting.”
The study was released on Thursday, however, indicated by a large number of voters in the Warren area they do not feel that they should run in 2020.
59 percent of the "can" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to the University of Political University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidate.
Research showed more support for former Governor Deva Patrick, 38 percent supporting 48% rejecting.
Other popular names of Democratic People's Republic of Congo are considered to have the possibility of running along with former President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially determine before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions an alarming experience in Track Palin on Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being registered on September.
He was arrested and charged at the domestic violence event Monday night.
What my son is going through, what he is happening after the return, I can understand other families that suffer from the devastating effects of our shocks and side effects that our troops come back with, “telling audience at the Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin named the point of arrest as a "proclaimed battle" and said that his son and other war forces, "they return to differ, with hard sect, they come back and wonder if there is respecting that they are with all other military members, for their commitment to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged by domestic abuse to a woman and threatened a report on domestic violence and possession when he was understood, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, DC support new immigration policy
The eighteen states and the Columbia District support the legal opposition to the new U.S. new policy that rejects refuge for victims who flee crime or abuse of home.
Representatives from 18 states and district submitted a small statement of a friend-of-the-court party on Friday in Washington to support their appeal by contesting policies, NBC News reported.
The full name of the broker in the Grace v. against Sessions which was presented by the U.S. Civil War Alliance held in August against the country’s unexplained policy.
He said his “and his friends” group of criminals, but U.S. officials denied their refuge in July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Local lawyers who support Grace have described the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which offer a large number of refuge refuge in the United States, as nations faced criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new application policy in the United States changed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board which allowed unregistered migrants to flee home abuse to be granted.
The Attorney General of the Columbia District Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that a new policy "dispersive decades of state, country and international law."
The law of the country needs that all claims of refuge are determined by the facts and the specific circumstances of the claim, and the delicacy violates the rule," said the statement of a friend-of-the-court.
More lawyers said in a statement that migrant law forbids misapplying the US economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and “provide essential services.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to reapply for victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal groups in June.
"The refuge is made available to those who escape their country because of violence or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a community or political opinion," Sessions said in a declaration on June 11 of the policy.
Refugee action was not intended to solve all the problems - even all the major problems that people face daily around the world.

U.S. Ambassador to China for ‘ harassment’ through the ‘approval’ adverts
A week after the Chinese official newspaper put a four-page announcement in the U.S. and China-based U.S. Embassy in Beijing using U.S. press releases to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump on the last Wednesday referred to the China Daily paid addition to the Des Moines Register – the most traded magazine in the State of Iowa – after hitting the U.S. mission in November 6, the claim that China has opposed it.
The claim by Trump that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US election shows that the US officials told Reuters was a new phase in the campaign getting the speed of Washington to push China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to put advertisements to grow business, Beijing and Washington are currently facing business battles that have led to the tax rate of each other.
China’s early cooking duty in the trade was designed to affect foreign suppliers from states such as Iowa which supported the Trump’s Republican Association, Chinese experts and the United States have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa, the premier supplier of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing had negatively impacted workers, farmers and American traders.
China, Branstad wrote in a piece of comments in Des Moines Register on Sunday, “now it reduces the tyranny by placing propaganda on independent media.”
In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government is using a method that is determined by the United States of America’s freedom of opinion and free information by placing paid advertising on Des Moines Register," Barnstad wrote.
By contrast, in the section of local newspapers in Beijing, you will find a very few sounds it offers resistance and you will be able to see the exact situation and different opinions that the Chinese people have in relation to the economic objectives of China, considering that the media is closely regulated by the Chinese Communist Party, " wrote.
He added that “one of the most popular newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say what a newspaper.
Replacing Women's Voters to Return to the House of Representatives With the Kavanagh Crisis, Analysis Warn
While many parties advocate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanagh in response to a number of allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warned that they would get serious results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The feelings surrounding this have become very high and most of the Republicans clearly showed that they wanted to continue with the votes.
These things cannot be reverted back, "Grant Reher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he should not be the last time pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation will be enough to beat voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and even November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and a national spokesperson for the development group of MoveOn said on Friday, according to Washington DC.
On the morning, the protesters sang a "Nevemba comes" as they protested in the central road of the Senate when the Republican Committee elected the continue and appointment of the Kavanugh despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The influence and inspiration of democracy have exceeded the expectations", "Stu Rothenberg, independent political analyst, told the news site.
The people say it has already reached a high level; that is true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women voters in small-scale neighborhoods, ages 18 to 29, who do not pass on the president, often vote for them.”
Even before Ford’s public witness described sexual abuse against the Supreme Court, the analysts said the negative results can follow as the Taj Republic will continue and confirm.
This has been a tope game for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Committee earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not only about the vote of the committee or the final vote if Kavanagh is appointed, it's also about the method that the Republicans have dealt with and how they have done," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps to select the Macedonians, said on the news station.
However, Americans seem to have some division on who is reliable after Ford and Kavanagh’s evidence, while many are dependent on Kavanagh.
A new study from YouTube shows that 41 percent of participants are obvious or perhaps convinced of Ford’s testimony, when 35 percent said they were evident or probably believed in Kavanagh.
Additionally, 38% thought Kavanagh clearly or perhaps false during his testimony, while only 30 percent said equal to Ford.
After pressure from Flake, FBI currently investigates the claims made by Ford as well as the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Court’s committee under the previous week that Kavanagh abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez says that the Supreme Court elected revealed its secrets when they attended the celebrations in Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web inventor arranges to Start a New Internet Compatible with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of World Wide Web, launchs a new business that will provide competitive against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The latest project of the technologist, Inrupt, is a company that is created through the open source platform of the Solid Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose a place where their data will be stored and the people are allowed to access access access consent of the information.
In a unique interview with Fast, Berners-Lee claimed that the purpose of Input is "to rule over the world."
"We should do this now," said in relation to business.
"It's the historical time."
The software uses the Solid technology to allow people to create "private online data storage" or POD.
It can include a contact list, a list of things to do, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
And unique about the online personal data storage is that only the user can access what kind of information.
The company refers to this as “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of the company John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, the process and the right skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes the Berners-Lee Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the developers who have been tasked to create this project and the dedicated community of code developers.
From this week, tech developers around the world can create their own single-parties using the tools available on the InputStream site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team have not spoken to "Facebook and Google about whether or establish a complete change where all their business models will be united in one night.
"We don't ask their permission."
On the post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt messages are providing commercial energy and environment to help protect the integrity and quality of a new network created in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the network when he founded the World Wide Web in the Massachusetts Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed further into a debate having an independent site.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain Associate and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I have a wonderful hope for this era of the site," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A Winner of Victoria Cross Award during WWW1
The only speed of the British Church to win the prize of Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter has been celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Colonel Lutena Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on 29th September 1918 at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by an ambush to target four days later and he never realized he had won the most advanced UK military prize.
The celebrations stone is revealed by two grandchildren in the parkden, Northamptonshire, Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that "is an amazing example" that the stone is exactly revealed 100 years from the victory of his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Lutena Vann led his force along Canal de Saint-Quentin "through heavy molds and high performances from the field and guns."
He then fled to the shooting line and with the "most bold" led the line to the front before using a gun of the field alone and targeted three weapons.
Manuel Vann was killed by a German raid on October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, a 72-year-old, said his grandfather's actions were "the actions I know I can't achieve but it's very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put the crown of flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood-Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, "he was very honored to participate in the grid" and added "the courage of real hero is demonstrated to the support from many people."
The MMA fans waited all night watching Bellatrix 206, but they found Peppa Pig instead,
Consider this, you've waited all night watching Bellatrix 206 but just refused to watch the main event.
The Bill from San Jose included 13 fighting, including six on the main card and was directly dumped at all night in the UK through Channel 5.
On the morning, when the Gegard Mosiah and Rory MacDonald were preparing to react, the audience in the UK was left open when the period was changed and that Peppa Pig.
Some will be distracted after they remained awake to the early hours especially for fighting.
One fan on Twitter explained to change and put children’s cartoons as “some kind of so serious jokes.”
“It’s a government principle that when it came to the morning the content was not suitable to change the program to become children,” said Dave Schwartz, the Vice-President of the markets and the communication of the Bellator, when asked about the delivery.”
"" Peppa the pig, "yes."
The president of the company Bellator Scott Coker said they will go to work on their schedule to include British audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the destination, I think we may probably consider this," Coker said.
But now is 12 o'clock on Sunday and we can't consider this until Sunday our time, Monday.
But we take into account.
Believe me, when it changed there was a lot of messages sent and did not grow good.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you that the future will not happen.
We will put it in five fights rather than six - as we do the most common - and we tried to make an effort for the fans but failed.
It is an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'felt' because of his sex
The irrigator in Olympic games Tom Daley says she felt weak because of her sex all her grow - but that gave her a motivation to succeed in life.
The 24-year-old said that he did not recognize it until he joined the high school then "I realized that not everyone like me."
Speaking at the Radio 4 in the Desert Island Discs channel prepared by Lauren Laverne, he says he spoke about gay rights in order to give others "hope."
He says the point that the parent made him not to focus on winning games in Olympics.
A long-lasting period producer, Kirsty Young, has been out for some period due to illness.
As a person who was excluded from the first Laverne period, Daley says he felt “a certain decline” than everyone of his age because “was not accepted social love for girls and boys.”
He said: Until today, the feelings of oneself and certain limitations, and the feelings of others are things that have given me power and ability to achieve it.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he could not break anyone’s heart when they realize his gender.
A member of the Olympic badge has been a prominent member in the campaign to support LGBT and used the opportunity to participate in ke in Commonwealth games in Australia to live a country not to assume the issue of the same sex as crime.
She said she came out because she felt the lucky fortune to be able to live without impact and wanted to give others "hope."
This third time the world said to love another man - U.S. filmmaker - Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "without expecting him."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is older than for 20 years, last year but said that the age gap has never been a big issue.
"When you go through many things in a very young age" - he went to Olympic games first with 14 years and his father died from cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone like that.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all her attitude" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are things greater than Olympic Gold medals.
My golden Medal of Olympics is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 as a 40-year-old man after he discovered a brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if he had still found their Olympic tickets London 2012 - because he wanted it to be a front layer.
"I couldn't say 'You can't go around that father's column," he said.
"I had caught her hand when she stopped breathing and I had to let him completely breathe and die that was the one who believed he had failed," she said.
The following year Daley won in 2012 and won the bronze Olympics.
I knew only that this was my entire life - dive in front of our crowd on Olympic games, there was no better impression," he said.
It also encouraged its first song option - Proudly sung by Heather Small - which had motivated him during the Olympics and made him excited.

Mickelson who has been playing well placed in the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will keep a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game of Ryder's Cup, but he will have to improve his game so that he will not get to the point without fun.
Mickelson, playing at a double annual event and placing a record playing 12th, was placed on the bench and captain Jim Furyk for a game of four balls and a game of pairs.
Instead of being in the depth of the event, how he was often to the United States, the winner of this grand cup five times compared his day between being a fan and practicing the game in hopes of rectifying his problem.
It is never a leader even in the top of his career, the 48-year-old player is not a suitable choice for the game in the field of Le Golf National, whose bad ball is punished on a regular basis.
And if the field is not a justification, Michaelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, is facing the British champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new player Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of this week.
If Americans, who are four in the past as they start a 12-person match, have high resistance, the Mickelson match can prove to be quite important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his person, not that he could say much more.
He understood exactly what he was today, and he greeted me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a very courage in his power.
He is a famous person and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t see him playing two matches.
I expected to play more, but that’s what happened and that way we thought we should consider.
He wants to be out there playing, just like anyone else.”
Mickelson will pass the record of Nick Faldo in many matches in the Sunday's Playd Ryder's Cup.
It can be its last in the play of the Ryder's Cup that has not been identical to its personal record quality.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven uniforms, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
"He is the brave, loving to vie for people and it is a good person to have him in the team," he explained.
"I think that players are also happy to fight with him also this week, which was lovely to see.
He has more donations than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the leadership of many symbols you can get lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from the experience that a major leadership falls in the last days of the Ryder’s Cup can turn into an entourage journey.
The debt played its first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by the Seve Ballesteros led by five points against Americans but ended with the game having hit the fire, and won 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You continue to remind ourselves that we had a great leadership in Valderrama; we had a great leadership in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, having watched Grade 5-6 on Friday and leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So the history signifies me and everyone on the team that has not yet come.
You're going to be more severe there tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you’ve done things right.
This game has never expired until you score.
We aim and are trying to win this cup and that is what we aim for.
I’ve always said this, I’m focused on 12 players who are in our team, but we know better the quality of the opposing team – the best players in the world.
"Impressed by how his players did in the hard field, Bjorn added: "I would not have more hope for this in this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
The next day is a personal performance that will determine and that is different.
It is advisable to be out there with a partner when things please, but when you’re out there on your own, then you’ve been fully tested for all your abilities as a golf player.
That’s the message you need to tell the players, is to act with your best quality tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner should go and act better on its own, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, the team captain Jim Furyk will hope his players will do better when they are personally compared to play as allies, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
Furyk himself was involved in the popular games in the last day, having become part of the team that won in Brookline before the end of the European era they found " Medina miracle."
I remember every word," she said when she was asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, she brought together her players toward the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get a good start as it was in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that speed goes through one, it puts a lot of pressure on those medium games.
We organized our players efficiently and put people in a way we felt favor, you know, we tried to perform a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been committed to trying to lead the fight and cope with Rory McIlloy in high match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and other Ian Poulter in the European team in the half of the list.
"I went with this group for this order because I think it focuses on all the trips, "said Bjorn for his choice of players in the private game.
New German warship was postponed again
The most recent British ship was planned to be launched in 2014 to replace the tally ship in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least the next year due to the devastating systems and cost increases, media reported.
The launch of "Rheinland-Pfalz," leading ships between the new type of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit magazine quoted a military speaker.
This ship was to join the Omanis in 2014, but future presentation issues influenced the fate of this great project.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg that the Nazis commissioned in 2007 come to replace the kind of warship of Bremen.
It is known that they will include a strong, layer of combating aircraft and ships and also cryptocurrencies, such as reduced radars, infrared signals and accompetents.
Some key features include maintenance over the long run - it is possible to send those new ships for two years away from home.
However, ongoing delays mean that those high-level war ships - which are said that they will allow Germany to target abroad – already passed and when they begin to be used, explained Die Zeit.
F125 ship gained popularity last year, when German singers refused to launch a ship and it returns to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Nazis restore the ship to the builders of the ship after the presentation.
There is no much known about the reasons for restoring, but the German media referred to several reasons for “the critical course of software and hardware” that made the ship out of importance if they were to be sent to war.
The decline in the app was an important factor because the Baden-Wuebert ship will be operated by only 120 sailors – only half of the employees on ancient Bremen ships.
Also, it happened that the ship was extra weight that reduces its performance and limit the Nazis to improve the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship of 7,000 tons is believed to have double weight compared to the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to defective purchases, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - it is also a great issue.
It is said it reached 3.1 billion euros (2.6 billion) – from the initial cost of $2.2 billion.
Problems facing new ships are particularly important due to a warning that the German astrology potential has come down.
In early this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament committee, admitted that the Persian actually "going to lack ships that are able to be sent to war."
The official stated that the issue has been ignored for a long time, because old ships were removed but no alternative were issued.
He complained that there were no between the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg that would be used by the Nazis.
National Trust Organization deplores the secret life of the pope
A new study carried out in a region in the Highlands of Scotland aims to define how the pope uses the environment in hunting their foods.
You expect these results will provide new information regarding the behavior of these unique fly animals and help guide the future storage activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow a variety of sweets and soprano species and as well as the most pope with ears and bars in the Invereton Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special record will be placed in key areas around the location to monitor the activities of all the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct phone surveys using hand identifiers.
Voice analysis for all recordings you will confirm the repetition of the sounds of the pop-ups and the species that it does.
Map of settings and reports will be provided to create a detailed context image for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the original storage advisor in NTS, expects the results to indicate which areas of the environment are most important to the panel and how they are used by each pop-up species.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management as well as the creation of feed and the best ways to maintain the forest for the panel and other related species.
Existing numbers in Scotland and UK have decreased greatly in the past century.
They experience a threat due to the work of creating and development that affects nests and losses of residence.
Wind tabs and lights can also cause risks, as well as pests and some chemical equipment products, as well as cat attacks.
Popo is not a particular blind.
However, due to their hunting habits of their ears is more important than their eyes reaching a prey.
They use complex local light techniques to target pests and barriers in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers very seriously.
It has trained ten trained professionals, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and sometimes save the panel.
The agency has even established a first and unique post-particular stock in the Threave property in the Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight out of ten species in the Scotland.
Mali manager David Thompson said the property is an ideal location for those hearts.
"Here in the Three we have a great place for the pope," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all beautiful environments.
But there’s so much about the unfamiliar panel, so the work we do here and in other assets will help you understand more about what they need to flourish.
He stresses the importance of spot checking presence before making repairs within the property because it is possible for an inexpensive damage you can kill up to 400 wife’s fold, and perhaps destroying all the number of bats in the area.
The demons are protected and illegally prevent them, harming them or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a battalion officer at the Post-Production Agency, has encouraged the public to intervene and help.
He said: “We still have much to learn about our panel because most of our species we don’t know how many of them remain.”
Ronaldo denies rape claims while lawyers arrange to prosecute the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo said the alleged rape against him was a "false news" saying that people "will want to declare" using his name.
His lawyers have planned to prosecute the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published such charges.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus are charged with rape American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
She is alleged that she paid 375,000 dollars to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video for its 142 million followers a few hours after the claim, Ronaldo, 33-year-old Ronaldo, rebuked the reports as “false news.”
"No, no, no, no.
They said today, false news, " five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or says in the camera."
“They want to advertise by using my name.
It is normal.
You want to be popular by mentioning my name, but it is part of the job.
I'm happy and I'm the same, "player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which said it is “unlike statements in the private area,” according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schhertz said the player would seek compensation for the " ethical damage according to the weight of violation, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The event is said to be held in June 2009 at the Hotel and the Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to return to the player’s room, which is allegedly raped back, according to documents presented at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after the incident and told him that for “ 99 percent” he is a “good” person who was backed by one “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but it was voluntarily.
Mayorga also says she went to report to the police and was beaten of her wounds at the hospital, but she later accepted the compensation of the court because she felt the "hort for revenge" and had no concern about "public shame."
The 34-year-old says he is ready to cancel the ransom because he continues to worry about the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the claim, and this season moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for 100 million pounds.
Brexit: UK 'will regret ever' by losing the carmakers
Britain ‘will regret ever’ by losing her place as a world leader in the manufacture of cars after Brexit, the Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was in line with the "unless" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the European Union without a contract would stop for the duration of production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr Clark
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays in the region if there is no contract after Brexit would lead to the loss of employment.
Burnaston Factory - which makes Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year where 90% were sold abroad in the European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK departs out of the European Union in March we will see a set up production point in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota at Burnson.
Some motor manufacturers in the UK have shown a fear of leaving the European Union without agreement about how trading limits will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
Big issues related to what developers say are risk for distribution in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota production is carried out on the basis of "time-effective", and the equipment reaches every 37 minutes from the sellers in the UK and the European Union for imported vehicles.
If the UK departs from the European Union without agreement on March 29, there may be problems in the border that the industry may cause a delay in the shortage of supplies.
It is not possible for Toyota to wait a day in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the Theresa May’s Checkers program for the future and the European Union is “reorganized right to avoid the same investigation into the border.”
"We need to have a plan. We want to have a better deal that will allow it not only to success now but also to take an existing opportunity," tells you the Leo Radio 4.
The "A witness from not only Toyota but the other developers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue access the distribution that has been successful in the future."
The Toyota could not say the suspension time for manufacturing, but for a long time, warned that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competition and eventually the loss of employment.
Peter Tsovallaris, who worked in Burnston for 24 years and is a member of the Unite in the factory, said his allies are increasingly rebellious: "In my experience immediately after these jobs leave are never returned.
The government spokesman said: "We have set the right and reliable program of our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with deputy deputy boss Rod Rosenstein can "alonging for another week" as the fight against the chief court of Brett Kavanagh continued, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein manages the work of a special advisor David Mueller, who explores the intervention of elections and Russia, the relationship between Trump and Russia’s support and the possibility of fair and president prevention.
If or Trump is looking for the deputy of the general lawyer and thus jeopardizing freedom of Mueller, it has provoked Washington’s speculation over the months.
In early this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein viewed the wire to record negotiations with Trump and the possibility to remove the president through 25 revisions.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at a UN meeting in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "advertently" not to sack Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid the conflict and case in the Senate Court Committee on which Kavanagh and one of the women accused of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, all witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI in claims against Kavanagh, causing a full-fledged release of the Senate.
Trump's news secretary, Sarah Sanders, was during the Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date for that has not been set, I can see that if it has been pushed back for another week considering what is in the main court.
But we will see what will be and tell the media.
The other writers could have opposed these words: Sanders has not prepared a press conference in White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of information is not due to the favor of the television reporters of “repressive attention,” although: “I don’t want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention.”
He then said that direct communication between Trump and journalists will increase.
"The president conducts questions and Answers on any of the future's president," he said, adding no evidence: "We have looked at the figures."
The "mediation of journalists will continue, Sanders said, but "if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the US president, that's better than to talk with me.
We try to do this many times and have seen we do so in the last few weeks and that this will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
The "Trump responds regularly asked questions when leaving the White House or as he participates in open forums or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media only when they are rare.
In New York this week, the president was probably expressed why, by providing random speech and sometimes happening before the press gathered.
Minister of Health writing EU staff at the U.S. Agency for International Health in Brexit
The Minister of Health has documented working in the European Union, providing gratitude for the country and anticipation of it will remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent letters while still six months to the UK left in the European Union.
The U.S. government is committed to meeting the cost of housing applications for European citizens working in its public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “In the summer period, negotiations between the UK and the European Union related to withdrawal have continued, towards the expected decision of this outbreak.
But the British government also improves its preparation for an impossible state of resolution.
I know this is a very happy time for all of you.
That’s why I wanted to mention how I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the European Union and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work, and help the sick and the community we serve.
The skirt is at your house completely and we want you to stay here.”

Outdoor buyers will get high stamp taxes buying in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be paid high tariffs on the stamp buying assets in the UK with additional funds being used to help homeless people under the new Tory program
The move aims to balance the success of the Corbyn stage of attracting young voters
Increased stamp duty will be paid to those who do not pay their taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance is expected to earn up to 120 million dollars each year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be paid a high stamp duty buying assets in the UK – and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May has announced today.
The move will show as a successful trial that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved to attract young voters by promise to offer cheap homes and focus on those with high incomes.
Increased stamp duty will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay their taxes in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government’s plan to fight housing conditions for non-discrimination people.
The additional charge – which includes current stamp duty, including maximum rates set for two years ago in the second houses and rental houses – may be up to three percent.
The Finance Ministry hopes that the move will give up to 120 million dollars each year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-British residents, resulting in a price increase and making it impossible for first buyers to buy their first home.
Most of the rich parts of the country - especially in the capital - they have become "rooted cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending their time beyond the country.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson asked for discounts in the stampy tax to help the younger people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies by placing high property prices for buying fields and refusing to apply to Mrs. May to leave and charge taxes to “absess in the UK” industry.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of interest in residential reforms, including tax control to conclude the condition of dismissal "without a fault".
He also wants to give them more authority to build a new house.
Ms. May said: "The last year I wanted to volunteer to restore the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our corrupt residential sector.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign countries companies, to buy houses at the same prices as hard work in the UK.
For so many people the dream of the house ownership has been far away and there is a lot of chance of staying home."
Jack Ross: 'The fate of my resolution is to be the boss of the Upkost'
The manager of Sunderland Jack Ross says "his destiny" is to be a manager of Scotland during a certain period.'
The 42-year-old, is very happy to revive the North-East club, which is now in the third position in the First League, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after he helped St Mirren to return to the Last Last Football League.
"I wanted to play my country as a player.
I was able to find a team country game B and arrived there, "Ross told me the Sportsund Session of the BBC Ukote.
But I grew up to look at the resort of Hampden with my father as a child and have always been attracted to it.
However, the opportunity will only come, if I am successful in the management of the club.”
The predecessors of Ross as a Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletics boss says there was no fear to follow these popular names in such a big club, after refusing Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at this time will be measured at ‘how can I restore this club to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and materials in this club, you should certainly be in the English Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple job to turn back, but I'd just like to see myself as I'm done here if I'll be able to get back to the club above.”
The "Ross has only three years since he starts management work, after the period as the assistant manager in Dumbarton and 15 months as a trainer in the club of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa from being discharged to third grade and replaced St Mirren from being discharged to winning the next season’s cup.
And Ross says he feels better than how he was while playing Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
The "Perhaps was a real way," recalled, taking control of Alloa.
"I really believed in the management, much more than playing.
It seems strange because I made the same, I gained income from playing and enjoying the highest quality conditions.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you should do every week.
I still go through these in terms of stress and labor pressure but I feel the management is the same.
I always wanted to be an admin and now do this, I feel better in my entire life as an adult.”

The best time for getting alcohol is 11.30 pm Saturday, study has found
The summer has increased exploitation in the UK’s struggling bars but has increased the most pressure on restaurants.
Bars acquired a 2.7% increase in July – but the exploitation of restaurants decreased to 4.8%, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business advisor, which included the statistics, said: "The continued of the sun and the participation of more time in the World Cup meant July followed the previous example and month of June, while bars gained 2.8 percent, except that restaurants gained even more effect.
Discounts for 1.8% in restaurant business in June were even more damaged in July.
The beverage bars did better with restaurants with discounts.
Food bars were affected by the summer, although not as restaurants operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get alcohol.
Controlled bars obtained a maximum of 6.6% sales per month and food dropped by three per cent."
"Paul Newman, an entertaining and generous analyst in RSM said: "This results continue in the direction we have seen from the end of April.
Weather and impacts of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the home market.
It is no surprise that the groups of restaurants continue to brighten, although the drop-off of 4.8 percent will each year take a considerable price pressure.
The long-term summer has come in the worst time for food service providers and we’ll wait if the average temperature we got in August will change positive things.”
The overall growth of sales at bars and restaurants, including new business, was 2.7 percent in July, compared to the decline of brand goods.
Sales monitoring in the Coffer Peach Tracker industry for bars and restaurants gather and analyze performance data from 47 working groups, with a total of over 9 billion common sales and is a key criterion in the industry.

Thanks for the message of consolation!"
Notice for breast pump comparing mother and cows for different opinions online
The breast pump company has divided online feedback using an ad that compares the breastfeeding and the cattle that are determined.
To indicate the launch of what is known as the “washing of the world’s most silent pumps,” the Elvie user technology company released a dramatic music video ad to show the freedom the new pump gives the breastfeeding mothers.
Four women are playing dances in a warehouse filled with cattle for a song that consists of such as: “Yes, I judge, but you don’t see tail” and “If you don’t realize this is not my breasts.”
The song goes on: "To decide outside, I feed the kids, decide out, decide out, and decide my women."
However, an ad, published on the Facebook homepage, has led to a controversial online page.
At 700,000 times of views and hundreds of views, the video has gained different views from the audience and many argues "holiness" of the lake industry.
A very serious decision by using cow to advertise this product.
If we need to get pregnant and reproduce to produce milk, unless their children are immediately removed after birth, “one wrote.
Elvie breast pump enters very well inside the breast bra (Elvie/Mama)
Another said: "The troubles the mother and the child thinking.
But why do not you use breast pump to the mothers who are left with their children?”
Another added: "The real announcement."
Others defended the announcement by one woman that she felt the song "to laugh."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I’ll get one if I’d still have a breastfeeding.
To decide to make me feel like a cow.
The announcement lies ignorant but I understood.
This is a product of high-quality design, "one wrote.
Another man said: "This is a fun announcement that aims at the mother who determines milk (of many times in the workplace or in the bathroom) and felt like " oxen."
This is not an award for praise or shocking the dairy sector."
At the end of the video the women show that they have all been playing with the pump on their screens.
The campaign concept comes from knowledge that many women who use pumps feel like an ox.
The Elvie pump however, is quite silent, has no circuits or penals and is absolutely sufficient within the screen of breastfeeding and giving women freedom to move, hold their children and even go out when they decide to milk.
She has Balarin, a partner with an ECD teacher in Mama said: "Elvie's pump is a revolution that was worth the launch of courage and losers.
Given the distribution between explaining women and the dairy cows we wanted to keep the action of beatings and all her challenges in the spotlight, while we demonstrate in a fun and pleasant sense of the feeling of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie pump has hit headlines.
During a Fashion Week in London, one of the two children walked on the platform to the architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrants to Tent Camp in the Texas River River
The number of evacuated migrants has even become the number of people who pass through it has not changed, because the politics and severe policies released by Trump’s administration have made it difficult to keep children vulnerable to donors.
Typically, many donors have been unregistered and feared to risk their ability to stay in the country by continuing to demand a child.
The risk increased in June, when the country’s mandate announced that potential donors and other adults of the house should submit fingerprints and be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Mathew Albence, senior immigration officer and Customs Implementations, testified before the Assembly that the organization had arrested several individuals who had asked to finance children who were alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not contain records of crimes before.
Nearly 80% of people who are sponsors or members of your family are in the country illegally and most of them are criminals.
. So we continue to monitor those people, "Bw. Albence said.
At the process of more quickly, leaders established new laws that will require some of them to be filed in a single court after they were arrested, rather than 60 days, which were customs in the forward, according to the residential staff.
Many will be delivered through a meeting call via a video, rather than a person’s presence, applying their case to a legal state for immigration judge.
Those who are considered are not eligible for assistance will be returned to their country quickly.
How long the child remains in detention is likely to be scared or discouraged, which can lead to violent feelings or escape attempts, according to workers and reports that have arisen from the past several months.
Lawyers said these issues increase in major centres such as Tornillo, where a signal that a child has poor condition is ignored, because of his size.
They added that moving children to the city of tent without giving enough time to prepare emotionally or interact with end-to-end friends can be boosted by which many are already going through.
Syria told 'American forces', France and Turkey to leave once
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moalem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although now eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in illegal Syria, under the pretext of anti-terrorism and "will be treated properly."
"They should immediately leave and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem stressed that the “war against terrorism was almost completed” in Syria, where more than 360,000 have died since 2011, and more millions being displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this holy war until we saved all Syria" from all the terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
The United Nations has around 2,000 armed forces in Syria, especially for training and advising the Turkish forces and Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 hosts in most countries.
In terms of refugees, Moualem said the situation was good for them to turn and blame "west countries" for "prophets" to spread out untrue fear" which caused refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate return measures," he said.
They put politics in human terms."
The United States and the European Union warned there would be no construction support to Syria until there were political agreements between Assad and opposition to end war.
The United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a bar apart from the last stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-U Turkey agreement has prevented Syrian forces from being supported by Russia in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the deal had a "clear time" and expressed confidence that the military move would help the militants including fighters from Nusra Front linked to the Al-Qaeda, who "will be done."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is looking forward to preparing the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to prepare for post-war constitution on Syria and prepare a way for elections.
Moualem put the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the task of the panel should be controlled “to investigate the provisions of the current constitution,” and to warn against interventions.
Reasons That Will Make Trump Win Again Selection For Second Chance
In that sense, Mr. Trump will no longer win the 2020 elections unless many viewers like progress and changes hope to be, the elimination of misconceptions and scandals will end his presidency earlier.
And be of course "the greatest end of the presidency forever!"
At present, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the age rating has doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN and about three to 1.6 million times on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, increasing from 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC’s Center “The Rachel Maddow Show” is leading in the television rating of 3.5 million viewers at the main night of the news.
"This is something that draws people because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, president-electing the ABC "Designated Survivor," about the minister who becomes president after the attack destroying the main offices of the Capitol.
Nell Scoll, former author of humor and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.

There is a value of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the story from Washington can determine the future cases of Roe v. against Wade, as migrant families can reconnect with world economy health.
The show is only a lot for the audience with the many opportunities they can afford.
However, this issue exceeds the most awared citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to watch the expert panel discussing the use of Bob Woodward “deeply” in the sources of his book “Hogue,” the 15,000 creative artiste of Paul Manafort (the “good dress,” Washington Post said) and the results of the Stormy Daniels explanations in terms of the body of Mr. Trump.
I, never, will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
The "Part of what he does and does appear as a real show is that he gives you a new thing every night," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the architect of the "Pawn Stars," about Trump changing characters and themes every day (start the confrontation in NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).

● Overflow money within the nearest election of representatives of Parliament
It is no wonder that the 17 districts of Pennsylvania have experienced monetary breakdowns, due to the re-entry of the newly formed parliamentary districts who are now fighting for the same seat.
The newly developed district of Pittsburgh has a Senior Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in the final elections of the spring season.
Lamb is pleading for the dynasty, Mwanarepublican Keith Rothfus, who is the current head of state representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is widespread by 17 new.
The maps were reposted after the High Court of Pennsylvania to determine in January that the old districts were engraved to be suitable for the Republicans.
The race in 17 new has established financial competition in the groups of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (CC) and the National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a famous name in Pennsylvania after a small win in a very well-known March election in the 18th division of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by Mwanarepublican for over a decade by President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts say the Macedonians have a little better condition to win.
America Asked for El Salvador to Support El Salvador for China, and it left
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already identified Beijing with a small pressure not to do so from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a great meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in the hotel in Panama until the allies commended the Trump management team.
Officials in the State Department decided to withdraw the U.S. diplomatic capital from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama with the "most recent de-identifying decisions on Taiwan," the spokesperson of the department, Heather Nauert, said in an earlier statement this month.
But the punishment was only considered against El Salvador, which achieved 140 million dollars in the U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Suggested penalties, which included a reduction of financial aid and visa application restrictions, would have a significant impact on the Central American country and the lack of jobs and high rates of murder.
While local meetings continue, the leaders of the United States and the United States proposed a high level meeting with economic security and compliance with the same last year’s meeting that appeared as a step forward in the effort to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in September, the top rule leaders announced that they wanted the meeting to go ahead and effectively ending any penalty for El Salvador.
The Vice President Mike Pence has now been scheduled to address the meeting, organized in October, with a sign of the importance that the regime has put in the assembly, the diplomat said.
And three American diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesperson Mr. Bolton refused to report details of the debates made by three U.S. leaders, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks without revealing identity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration and he also talked about without revealing identity.
The Case of History
The next thing to fall may be a report of a special lawyer Robert Mueller about the possibility of Mr. Trump to prevent justice, where there is now significant evidence in the public.
Mr. Mueller also pointed out his investigation if Mr. Trump's campaign was partnered with Russia in attacking our elections.
If Parliament has changed its control, Mr. Trump will find that he will face the cases of responsibility in the assembly, as we prepare to re-apply for the voters and perhaps the judges of his allies.
This is a lot of things that are currently saying only possible and I do not say that the removal of Mr. Trump in authority is not inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made with each of the Atlantic side that will affect how long the struggle is going.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a revolution against Hitler, if only Western nations would have refused to support and support the diplomats in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the following killing.
The direction of history rotates such a change and the control of democracy’s movement is upset or delayed.
Americans face the action of a number of changes at the moment.
What if Mr. Trump retires the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a person who controls the fate of the investigation to Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a fatal situation since the newspaper reported that, last year, suggested to record the president secretly and said they are not eligible to be office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Memory of Times is not correct.
How can we answer if the new investigation of the FBI against Brett Kavanagh is not complete and fair – or if he is approved to the Supreme Court despite the prosecution of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, we will be able to vote in the election of representatives of Parliament who will not be able to make Mr. Trump a consider justice?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face long-term risk.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the subject I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government that at the same time used my state.
He survived, he moved to the United States and, 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on a table with a balanced sign.
If I have that as my heritage, how can I miss a positive attitude about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has a lot hope before the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers is a host of Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrianists, after a good draw in Spain against Villarreal this month, will put it in a great place to qualify from G Group in Europa League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first match up to the 22th draw against Villarreal but believes Rangers can use these results to set up many things.
"It was a good score for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We entered the game we believe we can find something and we returned to the same color.
Perhaps we could get more at the end but, in general, the draw was probably the same result.
They were perhaps better in the first half and we went into the second half better.
Enter the day of Thursday, it is another great night in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three points but you will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very difficult, among everything happened to my injuries and changes in the club but there is a good feeling about this place now.
The squad is similar to players are very happy; your exercises are the same.
We hope we can push now, forget the previous season and succeed.”
Women lack sleep from the fear of savings for retirement
Although they became true that research participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be kept, few people spoke to their families about this.
About half of the people in the study of the whole country said they spoke to their lovers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
The "People want family members to care for them, but they do not take steps to have a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide insurance business.
This is how one starts.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide services if you don’t make your wishes known well before time.
Share with your mentor and family to discuss where and how to receive the services, because those options may be an important factor in determining the cost.
Share your financial advisor: Your adviser can also help you find the way to pay such expenses.
Your long-term financing options may include long-term insurance policy, monetary hybrid insurance policy to address these costs or depending on your wealth – the best you have funds.
Use your legal documents: Block your legal proceedings in advance.
Get a medical service representation document so you can appoint someone you trust in your medical care and ensure that professionals are subject to your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the attorney’s contribution in your money.
You should choose someone you believe to make financial decisions for you and assure your expenses are paid on time.
Don’t forget a small explanation: Think that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and cosmetics?

State prosecutors are seeking a rare penalty for alleged terrorist attacks in New York City
New York state prosecutors sought the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - an unexplained punishment in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, is alleged to use the Home Depot rental car to make an attack on the bike route along the Central Side Road in the Lower Manhattan, beating the strollers and cyclists in his way in October.
To justify death judgment, prosecutors should confirm that Saipov " intentionally" killed eight victims and "permanently" caused serious bodily injury, according to a statement of intent to seek death, presented in the Southern New York District.
All such errors carry the possibility of death sentence, according to the court’s document.
A number of weeks after the attack, the country's judges charged 22 for Saipov that included the interim charges for fraud, commonly used by state prosecutors in cases of crime and damage to vehicles.
Attacks require “to plan and be prepared well,” prosecutors said, describing the actions Saipov he did to be “repressive, cruel and corrupt.”
The "Sayfullo Habbilaevic Saipov caused hurt, destroying, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Damian Alejandro Pagnocco," said.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern New York South District filed a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was guilty of killing two drug sellers but was finally convicted of a prison life in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in the case of New York country was in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the husband and wife who were punished for death after the failure of a plot of blowing up for the Soviet Union during the two years before.
They were killed by death on an electric seat on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed a lack of regrets day and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He explained to the investigators that he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attacks after watching the ISIS videos on his phone, according to charges.
She also asked to show the ISIS flag in her hospital room, the police said.
He has denied 22 criminal charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of the country representing Saipov, said that "they are broken heart" and the decision of charges.
"We think the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting the application of imprisonment imprisonment without possibility will only be given such events to all involved," Patton said.
The Saipov representative team previously asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory’s MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put to manage the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore 'motivating the army of the people' today during a protest at the Tory meeting.
The former Ukip leader said the politicians should ‘to feel warm’ from citizens who oppose the European Union – as one of Theresa May MPs suggested that he should be a supporter of negotiations with the European Union.
The MP of the party Wafidhina Peter Bone told protestors in Birmingham that Britain's had to be out now as Mr. Farage would be the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge that Ms. May is facing it as a challenge to bring together his so-called side as the followers of Tory are supporting Remain as they joined different protests against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is seeking to implement his own partnership program with the criticism of support from Brexit, who support the European Union.
His allies insisted he would continue to continue with an attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the objection- and forced the European Union and the Lebanese party to choose between his plan and ‘discrimination’.
Mr. Bone told Leave Means Leave's meeting in Sohull that he wanted to ‘s throw off the Chequers’ program.
She suggested that Mr. Farage had to be held partner and given the role of negotiations by Brussels.
‘If you had control, we would have already gone out now,’ he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers.'
He expressed his opposition to the European Union, he said: ‘We did not fight for the world’s wars to lie under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.’
Mr. Bone denied the recommendation that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people changed their ideas and wanted to remain not really true.'
Tory MP who supports Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in demonstration and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
A ‘The bachelor’s programme is not very interested in the general public, the Resistance cannot vote, is not loved by our party and our activists who really go into the streets and help us to be selected.
Please separate the Checkers program and start listening to people.’
In a message directed to Mrs. May, he added: 'The Prime Minister preserves their positions when placing their promises.'
Mr.Farage told the meeting that politicians should be made 'to feel warm' if they are about to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
This is about the matter of loyalty between us - people - and our political class,' said.
They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we can't allow them to do it.'
In the message to the voiced crowd added: 'I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
We encourage the army of the people of this land that will throw victory in Brexit and that will never rest until we are free, we will be UK proud.'
At the same time, the Supporters remain continued to march through Birmingham before they held a two-hour meeting between the city.
Many activists showed the written banners of the Torress against Brexit after the launch of the group at the end of this week.
Leba MP Mr. Adonis ridiculed the sponsors for the safety problems they have acquired in the party program when the meeting was opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems and technologies of the European Plan to respect the laws of the other, to the unstable, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' added.
‘It is a lie.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," added.

Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the world cup after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear since when the Valtteri Bottas praised before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team will play a big role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a great start and almost completely abandoned Hamilton while defending his position in the first two cycles and invited Vettel to attack his colleague.
Vettel took the lead first and left Hamilton to follow the traffic to the group tail, something that was to play a lot.
Mercedes made one cycle and being behind the Vettel, but Hamilton passed forward after a strong contest that made the Ferrari driver quit the local free area from the effect of shutting it twice in the third angle.
Max Verstappen began in the back line and was in the seventh place at the end of the first cycle in its 21-year-old birthday.
He then led it to a large part of the race and then passed over Kimi Raikkonen and became the fourth.
He eventually came to his correction area in a 14 cycle and failed to increase speed in eight cycles while Raikkonen takes up the fourth place.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a wonderful job a whole weekend and showed it to stop allowing me to pass.
The team has done unique tasks to replace the first and second, "said Hamilton.
That was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump mocks Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday that he did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford who accused the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in the West Virginia, the president did not speak directly the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Court Committee, instead said what they did in the Senate, was "were, wicked and false."
One of the best things that may happen in the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see the people who are angry with those who are greedy and false,” he said.
When you look at the offers and discloses then they say" oh, I did not.
I didn’t do it.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal it?
Do you remember his answer ... did you reveal the document - "oh, oh, what?
Ah no!
I didn’t reveal it.
"Yes, wait for one minute.
What are we revealed ...No, we did not reveal it, "he added, by imitating the senator.
Feinstein was posted a letter stating the charges against Kavanagh and Ford in July and was revealed earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
I did not hide the charges of Dr Ford. I did not reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported
He asked me to put me in secret and put me in secret as he prayed.”
But his writings were not found well received by the president, who made a comment during the Saturday meeting at night: "I will tell you this, that was a very bad body language.
Perhaps he didn’t do it, but that’s the worst language of the flesh I’ve seen.”
He continued to be nominated by the Supreme Court, who was accused of crimes of sexual harassment by three women, President suggested that the Macedonians used the allegations for their benefit.
They have decided to take authority in any way.
You see selfishness, evil, careless from whom they are hurt, who have influenced in order to gain authority and control, "Mediaite reported the President to speak.

Another black man?!
A New York home minister accused couples of deletion of post-linking messages "discrimination colors"
A home minister from New York accused the couple of deleting the discrimination on the basis of receiving an indefinite message from a woman who complained that he was “one else black.”
The couple refuse to be racists and repress those claims with " fraud".
Lynsey Plastico-Flaxman, a mother of two children, explained his misunderstandings after discovered that a new child’s service provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after his first working day in 2016.
"HANAAAAATING THE POWERUSING," writes Mrs. Plasco -Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Ms. Maurice, twice.
After he discovered his mistakes, Plasco -Flaxman with a "unless" fired her job B. Maurice, saying that their outgoing sister, of African-American origin, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino, according to New York Post.
Bi. Maurice paid for one working day and then returned to the home of Uber.
Now, Maurice accuses a couple of compensation for the cancellation of 350 dollars per day, for the work of living and working, although without contract.
"I want to show you, see, you should do such works," he told Post on Friday, adding "I know it is an exception."
The couple have denied claims that they are the MPs, saying that the stop of Maurice is the right action, fearing that they can no longer believe in him.
"My wife had used a message that she didn't intend.
He is not an exception.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told Post.
But can you put your children into the hands of someone you have wronged, even if it is wrong?
Is your child young?
Say the truth."
While comparing the charges with the "drug," Plasco said only two months after his wife had become a child and he was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to accuse such a man?
That is not a good thing to do," the bank investor said.
While a legal case still continues, the public comment court has accused the couple of social media, and attacked their behavior with logic.
Paddington publishers feared the readers would not prefer to have regard to the dubious, new letter shows
Bond daughter, Karen Jankel, born in a bone after this book was admitted, said: "It is impossible to put into the first person's shoes before it was published.
It is very exciting to know about the great achievements of Paddington."
He said his father, who worked as a camera minister in the BBC before he found the inspiration to write a book of children from a small fraction of the bear, would have had no negative feelings for his work to be rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the publication was “happy and sad” after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who explains that “a very important partner of our family,” added that his father greatly enjoyed his success.
He was a man who had many words and had no pride,” he said.
But because Paddington was very important to him, it is like having a successful child: you are boasting even though not your actions.
I think he saw the success of Paddington in such a way.
Though it was his architecture and his mind, he was always praising Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to go through the phone.
Having discovered that his daughter had been rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad was a regular telephone saying that the situation was very bad and was not expected to survive," said Bi Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a call from Nad to tell me he will die in the following two minutes and I had to imitate him goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my child.
I will have you soon.
I will have you.
Medicines that doctors had given him so that his soul was intensifying force in his gentle system.
He had died a while before and this stage was just his system to stop working.
I just had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was in a situation I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to give me a heart.
Finally Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning his daughter, she rose up with the other passengers - without knowing what she was going on.
No one knew it, he said.
"I had bowed down my head and tears flowed all along.
It's hard to describe, but it's time when I was in a plane I had a great pity on Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him.”
Women mourning the card to prevent suicide on the classroom
Two women who have lost their loved ones suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been placing a Welsh card on a powerful message with phone numbers that people can call.
His son Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lived in Lyndey, said his son was a very promising cook and a memorable smile.
Everyone knew for his smile.
Everyone said his smile was pleasant.”
However, he left the work before he died, because he was" in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to get his brother after suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I always have a feeling that this will affect others."
Bi Davis created a card, "enabling people to know that there are people out there who can go and chat with them, even if they are a friend.
Never silent - you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends and Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother’s death.
He did not say that he feels wrong or is troubled by the thought, "he said.
" Several days before Christmas we found changes in its view.
He was very low on Christmas Day - when the children were opening their gifts will not be looking for them or communicating.”
He said his death led him to become immortal, but they must strive to continue with life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It brings us to heart.
But we must all go forward and fight.”

The Brett Kavanagh’s fate of the house when the FBI starts investigating
"I thought, if we could find something like what he asked - a maximum analysis of time, the scope of size - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr.Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "fall" due to the complexity of the resurrection.
Why did Mr. Kavanagh and his public followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their sunset is due to time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail so much, then they will be very weak in their bid to put someone who wants to be elected to the top court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling for Senators, urging him to support Mr. Kavanagh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the FBI report?
There will be ballots in the Senate, where 51 and 49 referees work.
It is still unclear if Mr Kavanaught can get at least 50 votes on the Senate, which enables Mike Pence, vice president, breaking the draw and confirming it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee number 'fall' under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South dropped since Kim Jong-un last seven years, South Korean attorney said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's union ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the highest control in the border between North Korea and China and the high rates of fines charged people’s trade were the main reason.
Pyongyang has not given public opinion.
Most of the refugees from North are ultimately given South Korea’s citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Korea people have crossed to the opposite law since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many escape through China, which has the highest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Most Army (a popular DZZ) among the two countries of Korea.
China takes refugees as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often forcibly return them.
Relationships between North and South - who are literally still in war - have changed so much in recent months.
As early as this month, the leaders of the two countries met Pyongyang for talks that focused on the elimination of nuclear weapons standing.
This event came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, agreed on broad conditions to eliminate the beefactures in the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for development since then.
Without any belief in the United States, there will be no faith and security of the nation and under that situation, no way we will remove nuclear weapons from being first," said Mr Ri in the speech of the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanagh as "can't be self-control," and said he should not serve at the Supreme Court
The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) leader Nancy Pelosi has said that the Supreme Court is "unless capable of self-control" and said he has so many feelings that he should not serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment at the Saturday interview at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I thought that if it were a woman who had done this way, they would say ‘can’ Pelosi said about her answers to the Testimony of Kavanagh before the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanagh completely denied claims that he abused Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
During his opening statement, Kavanagh was very sensitive, sometimes almost shouting and breath talked to his family and his years in secondary.
He also accused the Macedonians at the committee, accused of “repressive and coordinated to destroy his reputation” planned by the pro-surgents that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 president's election.
Pelosi said that he believed the testimony of Kavanagh confirmed that he was not able to minister in the Supreme Court, because he noted that he was discriminated against the Democratic People.
"I think he is opting out of these words and how he accused the family of Clinton and diplomats," he said.
The police did not refuse if he tried to remove the Kakamega authorities if he was approved and if the Macedonians were many in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this - if you don't say the truth to Parliament or to the FBI, then it is not only worth that in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanough is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Referral Court.
The Pelosi added that the Macedonians had no concern about the possible decisions of the Kavanugh against the Cheap Price Service Act or the Roe case against the Wade, because he was said to be a conservative judge.
In his conviction, Kavanagh avoided questions about whether he could alter certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Not in the time of the angry man, discrimination to the court and expect us to say, ‘it is not so strange,’" said Pelosi.
And Women Should Use.
It is a good judgment of bitterness, months and years of much more wrath and cannot take away.
"We weep when we get angry," Ms. Steiner told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that it's normal, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was at hand, who also cried when she became angry, but she created a technique that meant when she was angry and started crying," he could think of me because she was crying out.
I am angry.”
Then he continued to explain me.
And I thought it was a good idea."
"The tears are allowed as a means of excluding wrath because they are basically not understood.
One of my memory I was deeply recalled from my early work, is an office full of men, where once I suddenly found myself cry out with an unwise wrath, I was held in the back of the neck and a great woman - the steward who always feared me to the point.
"Don't let them see that you cry," he said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are depressed and you will rejoice because you and you.”
Patricia Schroeder, at the time as a member of the Democratic Party from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in a relationship outside of marriage in a boat known as Monkey Business and opt-out of a candidate, Ms. Schroeder, was extremely frustrated and there is no reason for the withdrawal of the presidential aspirant.
It was not a good decision," he said to me while laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed is one more.
There is someone referred this as the famous "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had gone so much, he was back in making money and he vowed that he would not go into the race unless he contributed 2 million dollars.
It was a war he was losing.
He found that some of his followers who contributed $ 1,000 to the men would give only $250.
"Do they think I don't get a price discount?" they wondered.
When he made his remarks to announce that he could not launch a formal campaign, he was filled with emotions - thanks to people who helped him, frustration with the system that made it very difficult to contribute to the electorate rather than to the gender-based discrimination - until he was breathed.
You would think I had a nerve problem,” recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the media took the case.
"You would think the Kleex company was my commercial trustees.
I remember when I am thinking, what will they place on my tomb?
"He cried""
How the U.S. and China trade war benefits Beijing
The initial voices in the trade war between the United States and China were extremely disturbed and although these wars will not end soon, the difference between the country may be beneficial to Beijing for a long time, according to experts.
Donald Trump, US President, issued a first warning this year by charging Chinese key taxes including solar, metal and aluminum panels.
The most impacted diversity started this week with a new tax affecting 200 billion dollars’s worth (150 billion pounds), thus charging half of all U.S. exports from China.
Beijing has always avenged, recently placed five to ten percent tax on US $60 billion.
China has promised to look into the U.S. stages, and the second country to the economic size is not found to disappoint at any time soon.
To make Washington switch point means you should accept strings, but to accept publicly the US pressure will be a great shame for Xi Jinping, Chinese president.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, business war problems against the United States can help China for a long time to reduce dependence between the two countries.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can start an economic change in any of its countries and the most dangerous than others previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research partner who focuses on Asia at a new Security Advisory Center.
Syrian 'ready' to return to refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily to refugees and it asks for help to rebuild the degraded country with the long-term war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al- Moualem said the situation in the country is enriched.
"Today the real condition is much more stable and safe due to the progress made in combat terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reform degraded areas by terrorists to restore regularly.
All situations are now open to returning to refugees in the country that were forced to escape because of terrorism and economic action that influenced their everyday life and work.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al- Moualem said the Syrian government will welcome support in rebuilding the degraded land.
But he stressed that he did not want support for terms or assistance from countries that supported the terrorism.
Europe wins the Ryder Paris Cup

America has now lost six consecutive times in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again the crown when the captain of the Danish team Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.

You have been a challenging year.
Thanks to Thomas for selecting me and believing me.
I am very happy, happy to win the cup again.
What's important is the team and I'm happy to help," said Garcia filled with emotions after European victories.
He transfers tasks to his fellow citizens John Ram who won the American Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I feel a wonderful pride, defeat Tiger Woods, I was watching him as little," said Ramh 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France and now has a record 13-1-3 in the Ryder Cup.

The U.S. team was overwhelmed all the week to set the ball part of the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a very high-level game in all competitions.
American captain Jim Furyk spoke after a lower game of his force, "I boast of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning where we gave you so many challenges the European team.
We fought.
Many respects to Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All its 12 players played very well.
We will reschedule ourselves, work with our America’s PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and continue forward.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be captain.
You must give a compliment.
They controlled us."
