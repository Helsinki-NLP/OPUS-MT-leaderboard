Increased incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Economic Union and the UK, on May 15, 2020
The total incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the target in European Economic Union and the UK’s economic region to confirm that, at a different rate based on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow rapidly in all countries.
According to the situation in Italy, countries, hospitals and units of critical care should increase their condition for the increase in COVID-19 patients who need treatment and especially critical conditions.
On 31 December 2019, a group of recesses that are unknown in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China’s COVID-19 Control Center reported a new coronavirus source that is currently known as respiratory disorders i.e. acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Existing evidence is so far that 80% of people with COVID-19 have moderate conditions of disease, i.e. asthma or pneumonia.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 grows on the most serious condition of the person being hospitalized with 6% of the remaining cases in need of critical treatment.
The death rate of patients who have been admitted due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we review the total COVID-19 events in every country of the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the UK (UK) and compare to the situation in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current COVID-19 visa number in the EU/EEA countries and the UK and the number in Italy from 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK nations
After China, COVID-19 spreads in geographical areas and aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world currently follows those of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a major disaster.
In version 5 March of the Eurosveillance March 2020, the Spiteri et al. reported about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 according to the state definition according to WHO.
In EU/EEA, the first three confirmed visas reported by France on 24th, January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases were discovered in all 30 EU/EEA and UK states, where between 31 December 2019 and December 39,768 and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,441 only Italy.
Get total number and total cases of COVID-19 cases
In the Center for the Prevention and Control of the European Disease (ECD), an estimated number of COVID-19 cases in every country, found from any official sources such as WHO, is updated daily at 8:00 am.
These data were used for assessing current COVID-19 issues in the EU/EEA and UK, in comparison to the Italian.
As part of the transmission of existing COVID-19 cases, we made a total count of COVID-19 incidents in 14 days reduced, thus taking into account the natural source of COVID-19, in every country of EU/EEA and UK, during the January 1 to 15 March 2020.
We also submitted the total number of cases reported each country on March 15, 2020 at 8:00 am compared to the Italian country for the period from 31st January–15 March 2020.
Current affairs about COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK countries
Current affairs in the cases of COVID-19 cases in 14 days prescribed in EU/EEA and UK countries in total following those in Hubei Province (China) (Photos 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK, the total COVID-19 events began to increase on 21 February and increased more on 28 February 2020 (exploitation).
This was further driven by the increasing number of cases reported from Italy, but across the EU/EEA countries and the UK showed the same aspects of the total COVID-19 outbreak (extraditional record).
2 images show the total number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to the Italian one for the 31st January-15, 2020.
It highlights that, by March 15, 8:00 am, another 15 countries of EU/EEA and UK already reported a total number of evolving the Italian visa in the original 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of COVID-19 reported cases increases in EU/EEA and UK.
The issues watched in the total COVID-19 event suggested that this vast pandemic is rapidly increasing that it can be compared in all countries.
This is despite different countries being in varying degrees, the difference in how each public health confronts the potential of different visa definitions in different countries and procedures for choosing patients who must be tested on COVID-19 verification, including people’s testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy revealed the situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed comprehensive treatment and information sources reported that hospitals and units of critical care were already packed in the hands.
Data regarding the treatment of COVID-19 cases in hospitals or the unit of addressing critical patients is currently available EU/EEA to 6% and 1% of cases of the respectively (data is not shown).
However, they should be gathered in a special order to be used along with the current diagnostic data reflecting the number of cases reported by the number of deaths.
A study conducted by 2010-11 showed a significant difference in access to critical and average medical beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per population of 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries can have little or more resources than Italy (a household appliances in critical conditions and about 12.5 medical treatment per 100,000 in 2010-11).
The structural conditions associated with the ability to treat treatment, with the estimated every country of the EU/EEA and the UK’s most vulnerable people > 90% of the past warpower to address vulnerable people, have been released in the sixth immediate assessment update on COVID-19.
Since the visa is currently included in certain areas in EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and units to address people in critical condition usually the service area of a specific number, information about the visa and supplies of entry to critical populations should be found in the silent units of providing names for the figure 2 (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and ongoing issues in other countries indicates that the major COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in EU/EEA and UK.
Countries, hospitals and units to address critical care so they should prepare for the continuing state of the SARS-CoV-2 community and increase the number of COVID-19 patients need treatment and especially treatment of vulnerable people, such as taking place in areas of Italy.
As indicated in recent assessment of the ECDC’s rapid, the urgency, and the onset is crucial in delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with changes from the control perspective to counter, as the expected increase of the visa population may not give the decision makers with the hospital enough time to understand, accept and keep their response strategies accordingly if they do not carry out it properly.
The urgent risk assessment also lists public health measures to respond to the impact of a major pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity where countries are able to increase their regulatory efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on treatment.
Lack of access to EU/EEA health systems is likely to be increasingly concerned about the in-depth treatment of patients within the next days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe asthma i.e. acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has been killed more than 3,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in the pandemic for humans.
Similar to similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be distributed from the presence and cause similar symptoms through the same method.
However, COVID-19 has less severe conditions and mortality than SARS but greater adoption and infectious elderly people than young men and women.
In addressing the growing nature of the number of literature about this outbreak, this article is trying to provide timely and practical check-in for this rapidly growing research topic.
We will address the core issues regarding epidemiology, etiology, variology, diagnostics, treatment, its sources and disease prevention.
While there are still other questions to be answered, we hope that this check will help in understanding and removing the disease that is threatening.
The Spring Festival Festival on January 25, 2020 has been an unexpected reminder that all Chineses who were encouraged to stay at home throughout the holiday period and for many weeks later due to a new outbreak spread by the virus.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that led to the outbreak of deadly asthma strains i.e. the server acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, thus, the World Health Organization named SARS-CoV-2 on 11, February 2020 and the corresponding disease was named for COVID-19 (COVID-19).
This vast pandemic started in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus has caused 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being admitted back home and more than 3,000 people died on the planet.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number 1” and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bumed/), in less than 200 articles published about COVID-19 including variology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnostic and treatment since the first report on 7th January, 2020 revealed a series of viral separation from many patients.
This audit is trying to summarize the research development in a rapidly growing new topic.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (ERS, and outbreak in 2012.)
Also, we will discuss things that we have learned to achieve now regarding the prevention and cause of illness and some questions that are not yet answered.
The traditional Covid-19 virus has been considered a non-hazardous virus for humans, which mainly causes approximately 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century, we have experienced the most widely circulated human coV with the virus, that is, SARS-CoV and MerS-CoV, which led to the outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and almost quickly spread to other countries with high levels of disease and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third COVID-19 outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As depicted in the 1st Photo,1, the symphonic gatherings that were not known were first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 for the National Health Commission in China.
Seven days later, a series of CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first worst occurrence from Wuhan was reported.
At present, the pandemic rapidly spread across towns, regions and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection among medical providers was reported, and marking that transmission from humans to humans were possible.
On January 23, local activity in Wuhan was blocked by public transport suspended.
On January 24th, the first medical research on the disease was reported, only among 41 patients who had been certified cases, 21 were the only one in contact with the Wuhan Seafood market which was considered to be the location where transmission started from an unknown beast source.
On January 30, WHO announced the outbreak to be global health emergencies.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread across China and around 50 other countries around the world (Photos.2).
As the situation continues to grow, the latter scope and the impact of this outbreak has not yet been identified.
On 11 February 2020, a survey of various 8,866 patients including 4,021 who were certified to COVID-19 presented the most updated image of this pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ULBi-HX_rHPX1qHXA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the people of all ages, but most of the between 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of the infected people had more than 50 years, only a few were less than 20 years old and 14 people were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 affected more men (0.31/00,000) than (0.27/100).
COVID-19 was expanded in particular categories in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average number of 5 days (2-5) from the beginning of the survey.
The average period for his expectation was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average starting period for him until death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The number of births (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and R0 changed was 2.2-34.82.
The number of infected people rose before January 23, 2020, according to the time of travel of many people before the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate of patients indicated by the visa was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the exchanged rate of mortality was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main parameters of the risk of COVID-19 were sex (age), age (≥60), and condition of the ammonia.
CoV is a small family of large and bonded viruses with single RNA chain.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha-types and coV betas are known to infect humans.
The sequence of glycoprotinine (S) binds its antigents that alter the 2nd (ACE2) and diptdyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, respectively, and then the connection of the membrane occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released on the cytoplasm; after the introduction of the viral genome, the cellular RNA and the nuclear proteins that are linked to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic chain of SARS-CoV-2 reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new form of beta-CoV with more than 9.98% of the genetic identity among the 10 monitored samples collected from the original area of this outbreak, theHuan Seafood market of Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is much more similar to SARS-CoV genetic than Mers-CoV.
Through an electronic distribution screening, SARS-CoV-2 fragments were found in the most thinner parts of human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recorder of SARS-CoV-2 equal to SARS-CoV.
However, the S SARS-CoV-2 protein connects to human AACE2 in a far more weak way than SARS-CoV, the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes worse infection conditions for patients compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new protein with an off3b code and a printed protein containing an off8 code.
An off3b of SARS-CoV-2 constructor can replace in a virus causing diseases and prevent the exposure of the IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any desired domain that works.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues, reported the crystal-EM structure of the full human height ACE2 to be the brainy of 2.9 Å in association with the amino acids B0AT1.
They found that the connection, open-sided and matched buttons, was collected as two molecules and a combination of ACE2-B0AT1 can integrate two S proteins, which provides proof of diagnosis and infection of Covid.
B0AT1 can be a medical target for the diagnosis of infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Stretch out with the middle-virus carrier
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have a source of exposure from the pops and was distributed to humans through cats and camels, respectively.
Through the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoV interface, they were found to be SARS-CoV-2 operators as these viruses are similar to 96% and the Vessel corresponding to SARS from the panel called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the central carrier that helped the virus move to humans from the restriction of that species of the animal is still unknown and the method of its distribution has not yet been expanded.
Ji and his colleagues, suggested the snake as a viral carryer from the pop-up to the human being involved the reconstruction of the S protein.
According to a particular study, Guangzhou researchers, China, suggested that a long-suffering cocoa, the boys who have traditionally used as Chinese medicine – are more likely to carry out SARS-CoV-2 according to 99% of the genetics found in the cocoa and SARS-CoV-2.
However the diversity of 1% among the two genomes is still different; thus, the perfect result for solid evidence is still being waited (Photos 33).
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be built into 48 hours of measurements in dry environment and up to 5 days less than 20°C and 40%-50% of moisture-conditioned conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 can have same attributes.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is heavily affected by 56°C flames and 56°C heat fibers for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chloropform acid and other oil-containers, but is not chlorhexidine, can effectively tolerate the virus.
All human beings generally don’t have to protect the body against SARS-CoV-2 and are thus vulnerable to access this new virus.
At present, there is no comprehensive research that has reported regarding the immune response of the body against SARS-CoV-2.
So, we can only refer to previous surveys about COV other, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Photos.4).
Generally, after the virus invades the carrying body, it is first identified by the wrong body’s immune system through the transmission of the patterns (PRR) including the identification of the C-type lectin diagnosis, the NOD diagnosis (NRL), and RUG-I (LR).
Through different ways, the virus causes the existence of an element that causes tissue burning, the maturity of degrade cells and the birth of the type I interferons (IFNs) that controls the spread of viruses and accelerates the production of anti-virus proteins.
However, SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus avoid the edge of the body's immune.
After a short time, the body gloves in combating viruses.
White blood cells of type T including CD4+ and CD8+ cells type T can play an important role in immune body.
The types of CD4+ cells trigger the B models to generate specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells are directly affected by viruses.
T- helper cells produce molecular molecules that help the conditions to be transmitted to help protect the cells.
However, the CoV can prevent the performance of T cells by causing the death of T cells.
Prevention of human body including migraines such as C3a and C5a and antibody far is also important in response to virus infection.
For example, the antibodies issued by the patient who survived were destroyed by the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, when the body immunity produces antibodies can lead to adverse effects of lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases, many organs do not work with even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighted initially is more likely to affect older people with other diseases and pregnant women.
It is common that people at risk of getting a large number of viruses or whose body immunity is weak, have the highest chance of exposure to others.
The estimated average era for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, often 3-5 days according to a study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, the survey on 1,909 cases indicate that the period for its expectation was 3 days on average and was between 0 to 24 days.
The most recent investigation as stated above indicates that the term for determining was 4.8.7.2) in accordance with the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is important for the health authorities to fix the time of quarantine according to the most similar period of your expectations, preventing infected people who have not shown symptoms to transmit the virus to others.
As a normal act, people at risk or infected with viruses are usually required to be in quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be added up to 24 days?
The hormones are the most common symptoms of COVID-19, which can be traced to the absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, chest pains, driving, fuel and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing and/or low levels of fresh air at the beginning of the disease.
In extreme cases, patients still have respiratory disorders, a condition that causes physical organs not to work, too much acid and hypertension.
Patients with fever and/or asthma and fever, even without respiratory disorders should be considered for the virus in early investigations.
The geographical investigation in late December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms were 98% on the fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% with difficulty breathing and 3% running; 8% of patients in need of respiratory machinery support.
The same results were reported in two recent family sample surveys and samples caused by a person who did not show symptoms of illness.
Based on, the study for democratic studies in 2012 showed that the patients of the MerS-CoV were also fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory machines, than the COVID-19 patients and this corresponds to the harsh condition of the MERS than COVID-19.
Operating (26%) with recession (21%) also appeared among the patients of the MerS.
For SARS patients, it has been noted that the temperature in the body (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), breathing difficulty (40%42%), driving (20-25%) and recession (13-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory machines were needed for 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576,000 worldwide.
Compared, the death rates from SARS to November 2002 were 10% of 8,096 cases certified.
For MERS, according to the demographic research in June 2012, the death rates were 37% among 2,494 confirmed.
The previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high at a rate of 6.47% to the level of accuracy (CI) of 5.71-7.23, where the R0 of SARS-CoV was for 2 to 4 frequencies only.
The SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV matching with their symptoms, death rates and R0 are displayed on Table 1.1.
The above data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to be spread than MerS-CoV and SARS-CoV but its edge is lower than the other two.
So there is a huge challenge of controlling the biggest SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV control.
In the beginning, it is often done in the same family or from the same car as the ship.
Patients often have a history of travelling or living in Wuhan or other areas affected or touching people or patients affected in the past two weeks before starting.
However, it has been reported that people could carry the virus for more than two weeks and the patients who were allowed to return home may again carry this virus, which provides an alert of quarantine over time.
Patients have a number of common or reduced peripheral blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the initial phase.
For example, the deficiencies of white blood cells < 4×109/L including the number of lymphocyte < 1×109/L and the added levels of asparte aminotransferase and the viruses were available to 1,009 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscles and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients with the C-reactive protein and the purification of erythrocyte increased in the blood of most patients.
For patients with poor condition cases, the D-dimer level, the product to download the status of the fibrin within the blood, was raised by the lymphocyte's number continued to decrease.
Non-standard conditions in chest tests were found for most of the COVID-19 patients and those conditions were with two-way shades or lung closures that could not be seen.
Patients often have abnormal connections, severe lung injuries and respiratory disorders i.e. acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
Assuming ARDS, an unsupervised burn, a collection of water and a progression of the nerves varies negatively with the conditions of the gas-pacting.
Working in type-I and type-II ranges reduces the concentration of evil products and enhances the concentration of location shock, thus reducing the risk of lung lung failure.
As such, the result of more severe chest tests is consistent with the worst extent of the disease.
On 18th, February 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 pointed forward to the inner parts of lungs, the structure of hyaline, the entrance to lymphocytes in the body through the many pathological cells in the lungs of the patient who died from this disease, in harmony with the pathology of transmission of the virus and the ARDS as well as that of SARS and MERS patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection through reverse-transcript series polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as a core COVID-19 testing procedure.
However, due to the high degree of existing disease cases obtained through measurements, clinical signals began to be used for testing (which no longer depending on RT-PCR only) in China on 13 February 2020.
The same situation also occurred through SARS testing.
Therefore, the total history of disease, clinical exposure, testing on the laboratory and the results of radiology are necessary and suitable for performing effective tests.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang’s group defined a mechanism for using the SHERLOCK approach based on RISPR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the 20th specification × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per sub-pointing for less than one hour without needing a complex power device.
We hope this new approach can improve in a unique way of importance and ease if it is confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of new CoV experience, medical professionals can provide support therapy to COVID-19 patients, while attempting to remote forms of therapy that have previously been used or suggested to treat other Covid like SARS-CoV and MerS-CoV and other types of virus-related diseases (Tables.2).
These treatments include modern and possible treatment and drugs are anti-viral, immune prevention, steroids, plasma from existing patients, pharmaceutical and psychological support from China.
Even plasma from the patients when they saw it was recommended to be used for treatment.
pharmaceutical products companies are glowing creating antibody and vaccinations against these viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lung at the beginning and is probably attacking other parts that reveal ACE2 though at the minimum, such as gas and kidney abduction.
Despite this, not working through asthma and failure is the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to remove the pain and save lives and includes the normal cure of fresh air, fresh air flow, help to breathe without peripheral machinery and help to breathe in the peripheral machinery based on disease conditions.
Patients with bad condition of asthma should be helped through extracorporeal membrane oxygen (ECMO), and the method of cardiopulmonary bypass used in the treatment of function or through asthma that is dangerous.
Similarly, maintaining the balance of the electrolyte, preventing and treating the second infection and working for the body organs and protection of key ingredients is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is also known that the cytokines due to the immune system of patients to provide antibody excessively fight SARS and MerS.
The frequency of the cytokines is a form of compressed system which involves the release of the cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNβ, IFNγ and MPC-1.
These cytokine inserts the protective cells to release a large number of independent furniture that is the largest source of ARDS and links to fail most often.
The immune system of the body is crucial in the treatment of a cytokines, especially for patients in critical conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumba, antibody that fight the IL6 of the same clinic, have been used to treat the cytokines.
Other cytokines therapy is combined with the immune control of the body directed by the T-cell; the IK-γ, IL-1, and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomba; the cytokine signaling period 4; and the HDAC barriers.
Steroids, as protective suppression, were widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the effect of contaminated damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injuries in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it could lead to adverse effects, especially the lack of blood on the bones affected by the disease.
Despite this, low doses of low doses of up to average have been recommended to treat patients with severe COVID-19 conditions.
By the time of writing an article, there is no effective cure against the virus that is verified.
However, the drug drug in the veins, which is a nucleotide containing sugar and the phosphate, has been found to be suitable for a patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new anti-virus medication originally created by the Ebola virus.
Later on, the remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other same-RNA virus including the MERS and SARS virus.
On this basis, Gilead has provided the drug to China to run a pilot pair of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and events are widely expected.
In addition, baricinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritovir, and interest in the possible treatment of patients with symptoms of respiratory disorders.
Operating, fuel, vomiting, liver breakdown and other adverse conditions may occur following the total therapy and lopinavir/ritovir.
The combination of these treatments and other drugs applied to patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients with antibody production
Blood collection of patients who are diagnosed with infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect health workers from getting a long history.
However, when patients often experience high levels of antibodies compared to pathogen on their blood.
The antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and identify specific molecules on the germs and fight them directly.
Due to this, the plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 was used to support 10 patients who were in a very serious condition.
Their symptoms were improved within 24 hours, including a decrease in exposure to virus levels and improved by the removal of fresh air within the blood.
However, verification and annotation are necessary to recommend a way to use large standards before specific treatment is created.
Also, clinical effects are highlighted, some limitations associated with the plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may trigger the body’s immune above revenge and cause cytokines to be produced, which is likely to have a life-threatening impurities.
Antibiotics in blood are low and the need for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to create and generate a more specific antibody in order to fight the global pandemic.
So it is more important to extract B cells from patients who have experienced and identify healthy genetic codes or explore suitable antibody against important viral proteins.
In this way, we can produce antibody production.
TCM is also used to treat a variety of diseases in China for many years.
However, its effects are based on the integration of multiple domains in a formula that differs based on the diagnosis based on TCM theories.
Most of the ideal ingredients are still unknown or not because they are difficult to recover and confirm similar ingredients or their excellent integrations.
At present, due to the lack of healthy and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major treatments for patients with mild symptoms of average symptoms or for those who are recovered from the worst stage.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing tablets were found to be treating COVID-19 effectively.
High doses of COVID-19 were seen in many regions in China which used TCM to treat 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, where TCM was used for nearly 30% of their patients of COVID-19, was only minimum therapy per (13%).
However, this is a high comparison because other factors of impact such as numbers and conditions of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his co-workers published a comparison study of western medicine (WM) alone with a total of WM treatment and TCM.
They found that the time needed to restore the body’s heat, loss of symptoms and hospitalization reduced significantly in the WM+TCM group than the WM group alone.
The best results are that, the rates of the symptoms of poorly ill-treated patients (from poor condition to poor condition) reduced significantly to the WM+TCM group only (7.4%) and deaths decreased only in the WM+TCM group (8.8%).
Despite that, TCM efficiency and safety are still waiting for better controlled experiments at greater rates and in many more centers.
It will be interesting to provide the action procedures and make it clear the effective components of TCM or the integration possible.
Patients who are suspected or threatened by COVID-19 are often subjected to severe fear of this illness and even kill people, and people in quarantine are also experiencing depression, loneliness, and anger.
Despite this, the symptoms of infection such as fever, lack of adequate air on body organs and coughs and adverse effects such as the lack of sleep caused by the infection of the body can lead to stress.
In the previous phase of SARS outbreak, distant mental problems involving extreme stress, irreversible attacks, mental excitement, mental stress symptoms, and people’s desire to give birth to life were reported.
Tracking people who have contacted a mandatory quarantine, as part of public health response to a COVID-19 outbreak, can be more susceptive to the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma about family and friends.
Therefore, mental health therapy should be given to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of contact with general public whom they need.
Psycho support should be included in the creation of various intellectual health teams, open communication and frequent information that is accurate about SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the treatment plans and applications of professional electronic equipment to avoid contact with others.
An effective vaccine is crucial to intercept the distribution chain from animals and infected people to vulnerable people and is being used as well as treatment against viruses in large-scale disease control by emerging viruses.
Efforts are set to create S protein vaccines to produce stable antibodies and/or protection of the body against SARS-CoV.
Several cut virus vaccines have been evaluated in animal structures for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines for older people and their models of viruses and protection against animals has not yet been identified before a medical study is established.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new infections have been reported since then.
In comparison, the visa and gathering here and the MERS are continuing to be held in the Middle East and spread to other animal sources in areas that testify to the spread of disease.
The vaccination strategies are designed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasma, viral bands, micro particles, similar to the viruses and small protein units re-united and others have been evaluated in animal structures.
The creation of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-body protective people is an emergency and essential responsibility for controlling this ongoing pandemic.
However, there is a challenge to overcome this difficulty because of the long-term required (at average 18 months) to create vaccines with far-changing COVID factors.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to fully reflect a medical experience for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover a pole without a condition caused by the preceding disease.
However, the same as SARS and MerS, COVID-19 is also associated with high conditions for getting illness and death rates for patients with severe conditions.
As such, developing a model that relies on clinical experience for disease is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with adequate resources.
According to the medical research reported now, these criteria may affect or be associated with the condition of the COVID-19 pandemic (Table 33):
Age: Age was an important factor in exploring SARS, which is also the truth in COVID-19.
COVID-19 basically occurred to people aged 30-65 in 47.7% of those patients with over 50 in the investigation of 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients who needed deep treatment were more likely to have other conditions of illness and problems and were older than those who did not have (in the average age of 66 against 51) and marked age as a criteria for the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than women (0.31/00,000 against 0.27/1000), as described above.
Early health conditions: patients with COVID-19 in need of treatment are likely to be infected with a bad heart and heart failure.
Heart events were also a major cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to ACE2-positive billing profiles, which can lead to non-work in the heart of COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that the age and chronic diseases have great relationships and can interact.
The normal result of the laboratory. The C-reactive protein level (CRP) inside the blood reflects the infection situation or injury of tissues and is recommended to be the criteria for recovery, receiving treatment and healing at the end.
The connection between the CRP and the weight and recovery capacity due to COVID-19 is also recommended.
Also, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), asparte aminotransferase (AST), a anne aminotransferase (ALT), and a creatine an inse (CK) can also help predict the result.
These disciplines are reflected one in many parts of the body, especially in the heart and the liver and are provided during the destruction of the tissue.
Thus, it is the traditional signs of not working with the heart or liver.
The major clinical indications: Measuring the chest and development of clinical symptoms should be considered as well as other issues for the forecasting of the outcomes and problems of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Defined above, steroids are immunocompromises that are widely used as an extra treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the level of infectious damage.
As high doses reduce the pain of the ingredients were widely used for SARS patients, most of the victims fell due to lack of blood on long-term bones and long-term conditions.
So, if needed, steroids should be used for low doses and for short term for COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the outbreak of COVID-19 many patients fell from abnormal stress as they endured long periods of quarantine and enthusiasm and see the death of close family members with their fellow patients.
It is important to provide psychological advice and long-term assistance to help patients recover from stress and refer to normal life conditions.
According to demographic research to date, COVID-19 seems to have different cellular and SARSological components.
As well as being produced in a lower respiratory method, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in a high-speed respiratory tract effectively and cause any symptoms in the initial phase of transmission, similar to other Covid virus that cause severe cold.
So, patients infected in the early phase or the recovery period can generate a high amount of viruses during daily activities, resulting in greater difficulty for the control of the pandemic.
However, SARS-CoV distribution was considered when patients are very ill, although most of the distribution was not carried out in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is worse and hard to control than SARS outbreak.
The largest effort is currently in China including the closure of ordinary activities in Wuhan and nearby cities and developing quarantine for almost all people in hopes of disturbing the SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been damaging the economy in poor ways and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing and signaling the decline of the pandemic.
The more optimistic estimate is that this outbreak will end up in March and the phase of its impact will last for 3-4 months.
However, some professionals are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others, estimated that COVID-19, which is primarily more likely to infect SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues, created a mechanism to predict the outcome of this pandemic and suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may infect two-thirds of the people around the world.
A group of lawyers reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in the dimensions of airways and the patient’s throats from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which suggests that new HIV-friendly programs could be such as cold cold fever.
However, the signs of hope have occurred in China on the basis of the decline of a new visa, which suggests that the current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to one million cases and half a million people.
However, through the strict regulations of the quarantine and margins of people, this disease has ultimately been controlled.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be weak in transmission and ultimately die or have a minimum of infectious viruses and be available among humans.
The COVID-19 pandemic ratio and that of SARS and MERS have been released below (Photos.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is further distributed through a cough or sneezing and can also be distributed via direct contact with viruses.
These virus was also found on a stool that raises new distribution possibilities from stools to mouth.
Recent studies for 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by infection within the hospital, including 17 patients with other pre-treatment and 40 medical providers.
Therefore, considerable attention should be taken to protect mankind, especially healthcare providers, community workers, family members, and even other people who touch patients or infected people.
The first step to protect yourself that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; using N95 cosmetics and respiratory masks (#180 versions) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Medical masks prevent water drops from a person who can be infected against air transport or stuck on other people’s surfaces, where they can pass over to others.
However, N95 masks can only protect against small breaths even for 10 to 80 nm doses, while 5% of those components are fully adaptable; SARS-CoV-2 is equal to the SARS-CoV in size and is about 85 nm.
As small pieces can penetrate even five masked masks, the health care providers who touch with patients must wear N95 masks (1860 versions) but not clinical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear components required to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect people through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 though he wore a N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through her wet eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear visual or sugar levels while addressing patients.
For the public in affected or vulnerable areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash his hands with a much cleaning soap than usual, try to stay at home to private cart and reduce contact with people who may have been infected.
Three meters are considered to be the right distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of transmission as well as prevent the spread of viruses.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus came as a new virus for the human world, its similarity with SARS-CoV as adopted on 7 January 2020 would have to provide greater attention to China due to their recall of the SARS outbreak of 2003.
However, it was up to 19 January 2020 when Wuhan Disease Control Center director comforted the people by saying that these new viruses have low transmission levels and is not a problem to prevent and control this disease.
This message greatly reduced the public’s rebelliousness, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they failed to face the disease when it didn’t spread further Wuhan.
Organizations of disease control in China may regret this and make significant improvement in the future.
For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful if they make public announcements because each word implies to the citizens and may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more careful and take steps from the clinic to wait for an official report from doctors or officials; (3) putting more obstacles to control the possible catastrophe in their previous phase rather than attempting to inform the public and to try public awareness of the response system over time.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus was started in December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and around 50 countries around the world to reach this time as we write.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the signal is also the same between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has caused the concept of reapproval to SARS.
However, there are some basic differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in controlling this pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 further affects older people than young men and women and their weight and death rates are higher than young people.
SARS results in high percentage than COVID-19 (10.91% against 1.4%).
COVID-19 patients are even spreading the virus when they do not show any symptoms while SARS patients do so in a very serious situation, which results in more control of the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in turn why SARS-CoV-2 extends fast and in the wider area than SARS-CoV.
A typical test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA can occur negatively for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients treated can be found with the virus again.
This result increases the risk of viral spread.
Due to the rapid progression of research on COVID-19, many important issues are yet to be solved, as follows:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus come from?
While an electronic model of 96% was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-powered COS channels, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is attached to the presence.
Which animal was between carrying and distributing the virus from the native carrier, for example from the pop-up to the human?
Without understanding the answers to the questions of #1 and 2, we cannot effectively shake the distribution and this outbreak can happen again at any time.
Although molecular structures and biological trials have shown that SARS-CoV-2 do you not even want to be ACE2, are these viruses enter the respiratory cells and cause the next technological change?
Does the virus also link ACE2- in other links?
Without answers to these questions, we cannot access the urgent testing and appropriate treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus grow genetically in the time of transmission from humans?
Will you be a worldwide pandemic, will you die as SARS or happen over time as much as a cold?
It is important but you can take time to find answers to the questions above and many other questions.
However, despite its cost, we have to end this pandemic as soon as possible and restore life in normal situations.
The nature of human coronavirus disease
The changing body and environmental conditions have contributed to the growing of coronavirus (CoVs) and its carryers, including humans for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) viruses were known to cause severe disease, such as common cold.
The outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has changed things and demonstrated how the infection of HCOV can be dangerous and threatening to life.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 has made the CoVs virus shine in its highest possible spread but reduced the conditions to cause the disease compared to the corresponding SARS-CoV.
The HCOV infection is based on animals and understanding the nature of the HCOV infection from animals can help us.
Many of the HcoV virus came from an instant where it was not able to cause illness.
The intermediate carriers of some of the HCoV are also known.
Identifying a carrier animal is directly involved in preventing human diseases.
Analyzing the CoV carrier interactions for animals can also help them get valuable insights about the potential of the CoV to cause the disease amongst the human.
In this review, we present an overview of the seven types of HCIV, by highlighting the history of its discovery as well as its origin on animals and spread it from one type of animal to another.
Very important, we compare and differentiate different types of HCIV in the view of viral turning and re-included toothpastor.
The current COVID 2019 disease (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Also, the demand for the flexibility of the carrier and the impact of the virus growth on the weight of the disease is also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) is based on the Coronavirus family, which comprises of a bonded virus group, containing positive impressions and same RNA.
The virus with more than 26 to 32 cables among RNA virus were called “CoVs” due to their shape as a crown under an electronic examination.
The structurally, the CoV virus has genetics that do not contain similar components.
Almost two-thirds of the genotypes have two large plains (ORF1a and ORF1b), adaptive to the protinence of pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Poliprotein is further processed to produce 16 unstructured proteins like nsp1~16.
The surface of the tooth surface has structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), mangoer (M) and nucleoprotin (N).
Some specific generation proteins have been transmitted by different generations of CoV.
According to the difference in protein chains, the CoV virus is classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), in the same way, the type of beta-CoV generator is mostly containing more HcoV virus and divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
The whistle-conduct evidence has shown that both exists and are used as the offspring of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genealogies, while birds are the main storages of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, the Covid-19 virus has gone through animal-type barriers and some have emerged that the main causes of human disease.
Until today, there are seven different types of coronavirus (HCoV) of known humans.
Among them HicoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Other types of beta-CoV include HCOV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of severe respiratory syndrome, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCoV-OC43,HCOV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are often resulting in volumes, such as common fever and/or running.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV virus, Mers-CoV and newly recognized SARS-CoV-2 are more likely to cause illness, which causes a fatal infection in the lower respiratory tract in patients with the most likely to suffer severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and non-explicular disorders.
The first type of HCOV-229E, B814, was given from the water supply of patients with common colds between the 1960s.
Since then, further knowledge was collected through a detailed study on the HIV-229E and HCV-OC43 virus that causes symptoms of personal weakness.
Indeed, the concept had been acknowledged among many that the infection of the overall HCOV is detrimental to the outbreak of SARS occurred.
The outbreak of SARS occurred in 2003 is one of the worst outbreaks in the current history, infecting more than 8,000 people with severe death rate for about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to an ongoing pandemic in the Arab Peninsula and elsewhere in the world.
The new 2019 HIV virus (2019-nCoV), which was later named SARS-CoV-2, is the ongoing disease agent of the coronavirus (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected them over 910,000 by March 2020.
The alert has existed and the world must prepare for the coming catastrophe of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HcoV virus is inherent in post, mouse or home animals.
Many of the evidence points to the growth nature of all the HCIV virus from the domains, where the viruses that go on and are not able to cause disease but show a variety of genetic conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a major clinical, scientific, social and ethical challenges in China and the world.
Monitor the cause of HCOV from animals provides a mechanism to understand the natural history, inspiration and control parameters of the disease spreading between species of animals.
This can also lead or facilitate storage search, centralized carriers and forwarders who supply SARS-CoV-2, with the effect of prevention of obesity in the future.
In this inspection we present an outline of the origin of animals, distribution among the types of animals and the capabilities of HCoV resulting in diseases.
In particular, we focus on discussing the common topics that the HCOV producer does not normally have the ability to cause disease within its natural carriers but is capable of causing a disease after distributed between species of animals to a new candidate.
We also review current aspects of HCOV growth where an increase in infectious ability is often accompanied by a reduced capacity to cause diseases.
The ongoing outbreak results of SAR-CoV-2 have also been discussed in this context.
The CoV virus of animals has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the release of the first type of HCOV-229E type of B814 from the water flowing out of the sheaths, the COVID virus has been removed from afar animals infected, including tanks, cattle, pig, cats and dogs.
In the last decades, the seven HIV virus has been identified.
Overview of the discovery history of HcoV in the time (Table 1) you can be educating and guiding.
The first type of HCOV-229E was released in a respiratory respiratory tract infection in 1966, and later continued to grow in the hands of the WI-38 lung cells.
Patients who contracted HCOV-229E showed symptoms of common cold, including headaches, positive beating, tiredness and painful throats, while fever and cough appears in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was issued from link development and enrollment in the warning mouse brains.
Medical components of the HCOV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to those caused by HCOV-229E, which cannot be differentiated from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
The HCOV-229E virus and HCV-OC43 have spread across the globe, and it seems more widespread during the season in the air-conditioning volume.
In general, the time between infected and the appearance of the virus is less than a week and, followed by approximately 2.
According to the study of human commitment, health workers infected HCV-229E had common colds.
Only a few patients whose body gloves are weak showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS virus, which is also known as “non-standard pneumonia”, was the first catastrophe caused by HCOV in a human history well copied by technological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HIV virus was discovered.
The first case of SARS can be monitored until the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS pandemic led 8,096 cases reported by 774 deaths, and spread through many countries and continents.
Apart from the main units, it was estimated that each would have raised approximately two cases and a period of exposure to a 4 to 7 day with a maximum of the virus being seen on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected SARS-CoV initially reflects the symptoms of pain on the muscles, headaches, fever, tiredness and chiller, then breathing problems like symptoms of future.
The decrease of lymphocy cells in the blood, the observatory activity of the degraded liver, and the increase in the cell of the cavaluation of the antiquity of SARS.
The breakdown of alveola cells, increased epithelia cells and the increase of phospre also appears to SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients later require comprehensive treatment and testing machines.
With less respiratory method, many ingredients including gas gas gas intestinal method, liver and kidneys can also be transmitted in these cases, usually accompanied by a cytokines, which can be dangerously dangerous for patients whose body immunity is affected.
The virus was first released from the screening of the patient’s lung surgery who travelled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, the efforts are put in the study of HCV.
The HCOV-NL63 virus was issued from a 3-month-old Child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
In the beginning, it was found spread among young children, older people and patients whose body's immunes have been affected by respiratory diseases.
The appearance of the flu, the eye compressor, the temperature and the bronchilli is usually in the disease caused by the HcoV-NL63.
Another independent study defined the release of the same virus from a surgical sample from a 3-month-old boy who was suffering from a disease in the Netherlands.
Although they were discovered in the Netherlands, they spread the world.
It has been estimated that the HCOV-NL63 contributes 4.7% of the common respiratory diseases and occurs in the early times of the summer, breakup and be avoided.
The HCOV-NL63 virus is associated with the transmission of the throat, also called the frequency.
The year, the HCOV-HKU1 virus was issued from 71-year-old hospital who was ill with pneumonia and treated in lungs in Hong Kong.
Apart from the socially distributed ammonia and sealing through the airways in the lungs, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with the severe collapse of asthma.
The same virus as HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were available throughout the world and led to asthma diseases.
All these socially distributed HCOV viruses have found a way to stay in humans better and are less likely to change in order to cause virus disease, although accidents occur as in a rare cases of the most powerful type of HCV-NL63, which recently reported to cause severe respiratory infection in China.
In general, these HCOV virus is able to effectively transmit and keep maintaining it within humans, as well as their viral or psychological ability decreases.
The MERS-CoV virus was first released in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung disease in Saudi Arabia.
Although most cases confirmed in the Middle East, visas from foreign countries have repeatedly spread to other people until they have been reported in European and Tunisia.
The second outbreak took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The MERS clinical signs are like those of SARS, with the characteristics of the continuous ammonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also found a lack of urinary tract failure, which is very unique to the MERS among diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients show symptoms of stomach disorders, such as driving and getting found.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2500 cases reported by high death cases for 34.4%, making the MERS-CoV one of the most common humanized virus.
During the middle-to-month period in December 2019, a collection of onia patients who were previously notified of infection by SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization announced a continuous outbreak of low respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be an Emergency for International Anxiety and also named COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases are verified around the world with an alarming rate of 3.4%.
It is evident that, the death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while outside the region is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Operating is also manifested in some patients.
Nimonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can continue to grow quickly and become a severe breathing syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are closely similar to 82% nucleotide series, they converge with having different branches in a whistle-rich.
It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 does not have high potential to cause disease but its supply is high compared to SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV.
People who do not show the symptoms of infection with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its immediate spread around the world.
Comparing and distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 and other six types of HCOV have shaped the same with very interesting variations.
First, the program between exposure and appearance and the period of the existence of the HcoV disease is the same.
Due to this, the SARS-CoV-2 virus follows the normal trend of other HCIV virus.
Second, the weight of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four transmission of HCoV (i.e. HCOV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 indicates the characteristics that usually appear during the transmission of HCOV’s social transmission, including showing non-specialized symptoms, volume or even absence of any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, although the tests are lesser.
Third, the supply of SARS-COV-2 also indicates an interesting patterns of HCOV distributed community by SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the spread capabilities of SARS-CoV-2 are at least as high as that of the social distributed HCoV virus.
On the other hand, it will remain confirmed if the spread of SARS-COV-2 disease decreases after human adoption as in SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV cases.
Finally, similar to other HCIV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected in stool sample.
If the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the stool on the lips plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least some conditions remain cleared through the study of the future.
It is also interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 virus can occur as it is in the cases of a social disarmament.
Despite this, SARS-CoV-2 components including the ability to be distributed, the ability to infect and spread after human adoption will have influence on the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak destiny.
All four socially distributed HcoVs that cause moderate symptoms are humanized.
In another view, it may also be the fact that humans are accustomed to these four HIV virus.
That is, they may all be the repatriators of former HCIV disasters.
The HCOV virus that causes severe disease to humans and humans who have been treated.
This should be done, the HIV virus must be produced in humans to allow a collection of flexible changes to combat the control parameters of the virus.
With this logic, as the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 continues and how much more people are infected, the greater the likelihood that you will move towards humans.
If the virus is likely likely, its spread to humans can be difficult to control it through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four social spread coronavirus has spread among people, citing common colds among people/kindly.
These viruses do not require storage within the animal.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV virus and Mers-CoV that are most commonly distributed in humans and the spread of it among humans cannot be controlled.
They need to maintain and sustain their conservations within the animals and seek opportunities for the spread of vulnerable human beings, perhaps through the second and so on.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has the same features as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and HCV four social distributed viruses.
They are more likely to be distributed as a socially distributed HCoV virus, at least at the moment.
However, it causes more disease than the socially distributed HCOV virus and its ability to cause illness is lower than SARS-CoV or MerS-CoV.
It will remain visible if it is fully understandable to humans and spread it into humans without storage or pet.
Before discussing the origins of HCOV animals, it would be best for us to discuss the definition and characteristics of the growth carrier, nature, storage and supplier of HCOV propagation.
The animal is used as a HCOV channel to grow if he has saved a close sized clan in the nucleid sequence.
The cryptocurrencies are usually familiar with and are not able to cause illness within this carryer.
Similarly, a candidate who is a reserve always with HCV and for a long time.
In all cases, the virus is transmitted and it is the native supplier of HCOV or its viruses that are generations.
On the contrary, if the HIV virus is first logged into a centralized carrier or nearly its entry to humans, they are not likely to be in a new environment and often cause illness.
This medium carrier can be used as a source of transmission to humans and implements the role of the distributor by allowing the virus to be generated and then distributed to humans to multiply the transmission rate for humans.
The HCOV virus can undergo an impact if they are unable to maintain its supply within the centralized carrier.
On the other hand, the HCOV virus can also move into its medium-sized carrier and even create long-term conditions.
In this case, the central carrier becomes a native carrier that preserves the virus.
The digital data revealed in a way backing that the SARS’s modern privacy had a history of accompanying wild animals.
The next analysis of infection rate denoted that animals traders had a high level of anti-SARS-CoV iGG compared to the total number of people.
The masked (Pagama larvata) and the paint dogs in the animal markets were first identified to carry the virus that resembles SARS-CoV which is close to SARS-CoV.
This was supported in an indirect manner by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported after all levels were killed in the market.
However, it has been reported that the masked collisions from the wild or in the countryside without being marketed by SARS-CoV, and signaling that the mask-like patients can only be used as medium-sized speculers to spread but are not the physical storage of SARS-CoV.
It will be noted that, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou marketing have anti-SARS-CoV, the probability that many types of small mammals can also be used as the medium bearers of SARS-CoV cables cannot be ignored.
All of these seem to be non-emergers of SARS-CoV.
The following animal search that is a native SARS-CoV carrier showed that the coronavirus is closely related to the presence, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-BatCoV HKU3), is located within Chinese brothies.
These demons have antibody against SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 tooth line.
These viruss and other COV panels have 88-92% similar nucleotides containing SARS-CoV.
This study has laid the foundation for a new concept that the pope carries emerging human viruses.
Several Covid viruses (SL-CoVs) similar to SARS have also been identified in the panel, but none of the other than the WIV1 can be excluded as organic virus.
Human hormone resulting in a blood pressure that transforms 2 levels (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 virus presented in a panel stool sample was shown to use positivity, although with ACE2 of human beings as an entry factor in the cell.
Interestingly, a policy from experienced SARS patients could destroy WIV1.
By now, the WIV1 virus represents a very close generation of SARS-CoV in the panel, with 95% of the corresponding nucleotide sequences.
For example, the overall reliability that the WIV1 are not the power producers between SARS-CoV and the medium-serving ones that retain SARS-CoV.
Electronic analysis puts together the MERS-CoV in a group similar to the COVID-HKU4 virus and the virus for the instant.
The CoV-HKU4 Instant and MERS-CoV virus uses the same carrier receptors, dipeptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-component cellular depending on the MSER-CoV polymerization is about to be identically genetically modified and contained within the beta-coV virus identified in Europe and Africa.
By now, there are no active MSERS-COV viruses that can be found inside the wild battalion.
The MERS-CoV and its nearest COV-HKU25 community have an example of 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, there may not be centralized bearers of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a study by the Middle East has shown that the tallest camels have a specific antibody for balancing the MerS-CoV, similar to the Middle East’s natural camels in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV virus corresponding to a human-produced virus provided from surgical samples from the longer camels, and further signaling that camels can be used as true MSERS-CoV drivers.
It is also important to keep in mind that the symptoms usually have viral delivery as a whole appeared to the infected germs-CoV for testing.
It is clear that the infected camels only provide a respiratory tract but also through a stool, which is a great way to remove viruses from the presence.
However, the questions are not yet answered for most cases of people who are qualified to have a history of camels before the start of symptoms, and to strongly indicate human transmission to humans or unknown methods of transmission that are not identified to carry the MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus consists of 96.2% of the nucleotide equivalent to the Covid-13 virus produced in the original Rhinophous affins.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MerS-CoV, successive differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are so large that they can’t be installed a fertility relationship.
That is to say, wherever it may not be the close carryers of SARS-CoV-2 unless the virus closest to fit will be found in the future.
It can be considered that, the middle-aged SARS-CoV-2 carrier should be among the types of wild animals sold and killed in the General Market of Huanan Seafood, where most of the first cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating the probability of transmission from the animal to humans.
Most of the recent metric studies have indicated that a group of high-risk mammals known as cocoa (Manis javanica) are able to carry traditional beta-CoV-2 virus associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These COV liners from glucose have 85-92% of nucleotide sequences equivalent to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are also related in the same way closely with the RaTG13 for approximately 90% of the identification at the level of the nucleotide series.
It is arranged in two sub-virus societies similar to SARS-CoV-2 in a whistleblower, one of them if it shares a similar domain of capture (RBD) equal to SARS-CoV-2, containing 97.4% of the amino acids series.
In an open contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 virus wide is quite different, although the proportion of the corresponding tooth chain.
A preliminary study on the screening saw patients also reported the discovery of the virus in the kidney samples that happened to be connected to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of collection and correction to produce a half-tooth series with 86.3% of the full length of the viral genome.
We can’t freeze out the possibility that it saw is one of the leading cattle of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the live nature of SARS-CoV-2 cocoa from the difference between SARS-CoV-2 virus and beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2 corner.
Also, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that of the beta-CoV virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 obtained by cocoa to see.
The route to the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in the panel, they found and other mammals still remain recognized.
Although the most advanced chain model is found in the RBD between beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 acquired by cocoa, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 has a high-level pair of tooth valve.
It is widely reflected that the high model between beta-coV virus equivalents associated with SARS-CoV-2 is available within the cocoa to see with SARS-CoV-2 led by the accumulation growth brought on the basis of selection.
Suggestion supports reconnecting between the beta-CoV virus associated with SARS-CoV-2 found by cocoa to see the RaTG13 in the third type of wild animals.
As a boost in growth, reconnection is spread among the beta-CoV virus.
Decisions are still not reached about the close nature of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
Apart from the main possibilities of HCoV resulting diseases, the origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 from animals has also been researched.
Clinical evidence shows that the HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E virus may be due to the back-CoV, while the HIV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 virus is found within the mouse category.
It has been reported that the COVID virus called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) discovered in North America three colors present a close relationship with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCOV-229E virus was related to other bat CoV virus, called Hipposideros/GhanKwam/19/2008, discovered in Ghana, while small camel animals are also suspected of being his medium bearers.
Obviously, the current knowledge of the origin of the famous HCOV virus is installed in a summarized form in 1st diagram with Table 2.
The genetic analytics has provided evidence of cases of transmission of HCOV between species of animals in history.
When the HIV-OC43 virus spreads between animals and humans from around the animal in 1890, a deadly epidemic was witnessed.
The history of the distribution between the cattle of HcoV-229E is not vague.
The alpha-CoV virus is closely related to HCOV-229E is available.
Of the virus, there are alpha-CoV virus available for alpaca who is a form of animal.
Several evidence lines support the direct transmission of the virus from the presence to humans.
First, humans and not alpaca who are animals may have contacted and are present in the ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely interacting with alpaca who are animals.
Second, the alpha-CoVs of battalion associated with HCOV-229E is different and does not have the ability to cause the disease within the panel, while the alpha-CoV virus acquired with alpaca caused a respiratory outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV virus found in the alpaca animal were not found in the wild animals.
Thus, the possibility of alpaca access to alpha-CoV virus associated with HCV-229E from humans cannot be closed out.
Indeed, there is a direct source of viruses that cause disease in humans including the virus for dogs, Ebola virus, Zip and Hendra virus.
So it is not so strange that the panel is able to transmit HCV-229E directly to humans.
Otherwise, although the alpha-CoV virus is used as a hicoV-229E gene domain, the alpaca and the most tallest camels may be used as the intermediate carrier of viruses that transmit the virus to humans, especially in the conditions of the MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV virus is used as an excellent distribution model between animals from blinds to long camels and from long camels to humans.
The nature of MerS-CoV growth from the panel is known in its first diagnosis and has also been proven by the following results.
It is clear that it provides a general collection of virus types for inter-group animals and distribution between animals and animals.
The ability to survive for a long time, a busy settlement, close social interaction and strong jumping capabilities are the conditions that make it exists to become a ‘world that can spread the virus’.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been inside the long camels for decades.
Properly moved into these camels who have turned away from the middle of the virus to be stable and natural carriers who keep the virus.
MERS-CoV leads to very much disease and maintains a minimum conversion rate compared to among these animals.
Its immediate direct distribution to humans is an accident and human remains the end-of-MERS-CoV carrier because its distribution cannot be fixed.
On the contrary, the role of camels in the supply of MERS-CoV, the role of cocoa, if any, in the supply of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV virus is available for cocoa to see is a great potential to cause disease within the cocoa.
They may be the beta-CoV virus carriers associated with SARS-CoV-2- infected, equivalent to the level in SARS-CoV mode.
Several possibilities for the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 between organisms from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in the study of the future.
First, there can be virus bearers associated with SARS-CoV-2 that are close to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecosystems and exist through mining or coal mining.
Secondly, they saw that one of the medium forwarding viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 for the first time.
Humans get viruses through slaughtering and eating wild animals.
There is a possibility that many mammals including household animals can find SARS-CoV-2.
The study of domestic and wild animals for the antibodies you deserve.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, reincarceration and correction of SARS-CoV-2 may be carried out in the third creature that was accompanied by the pope and saw.
The S SARS-CoV-2 cylinder search from the animals is still going.
Apart from the different types of carriers, the three main parameters on the viral side are also important in enabling the virus to be distributed in creations.
First of all, their high conversion rates in RNA production.
Compared to other same RNA virus, the estimated rates of coV can be considered “average” or “high” while the average exchange rate is ~10-4 per location 2, depending on the passing phase of the coV on its new carrier.
The CoVs Virus have a wheel-colonial escruisance, which its deletion causes an increase in flexibility, reduce the impact or even its capacity.
Interesting thing is that, the nucleotide sequence Remdesivir is known to maintain the COV production through the inhibition of electrons and RNA polymeris depending on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most capable vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 conducted clinical trials.
Despite this, the rates of CoV conversion are approximately a million times more than those of its carryers.
Also, the conversion rates are often high when the CoV virus is not headed to the candidate.
Compared to SARS-CoV viruses with high flexibility levels, the flexibility rates for SARS-CoV-2 are specify that they are less, the more likely condition for human saturation.
It can be considered, already led to another closest to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, this is also used for MerS-CoV, a virus that is well-oriented within the longest camels.
The theoretically, there is no possibility that genetic changes can make vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 should not be effective quickly.
Second, the large RNA tooth on CoVs has more flexibility to change the tooth correction for transformation and recombination, thus increasing the potential of growth combined between organisms, which are beneficial to the emergence of the new COVID status.
These are supported by a special television-free frame with the functionality of the proteins encoded toward the end of the 3th session.
Thirdly, the CoV random and constant changes the RNA production time through a specific "copy-choice" procedure.
Within a virus carrier used as a mixing tool, a standard conversion takes place at a time of copied to a coV RNA.
The most common RNA of full length and micro-tooth tubes can reconnect to producing new COV.
The re-entry biofilm proof is found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, and such as the virus found in animals such as the SL-CoV virus and the IV-HKU9 panel virus.
The contact of the virus carrier is associated with the distribution
Apart from the three parameters of the virus mentioned above, the interaction of the carrier's receptors is another critical factor in the distribution between organisms.
Here in, reconnecting to SARS-CoV is considered an ordinary example, which also demonstrated evidence of a positive selection during the intermediaries of organisms.
According to the comparative analysis between SARS-CoV within humans and levels, SARS-CoV is thought to quickly adapt to different carriers, especially to the changes in the S-print RBD.
Generally, the RBD in the COV S printer interacts with the cell receptor and is selected in detail by the response to the carrier's antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 510 amino acids in the S1 piece, which you do not want ACE2 human plus the major receptors for the entry of the virus.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of identifying AC2’s remote animal receptors, including batons, pools, and dogs, and allowing the distribution of viruses between organisms.
Indeed, only 6 amino acids were found to be different from human-based viruses and although on RBD and 4 of them are in part of integrating receptors for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV Virus contained within the Ngawa containing the K479N and S487T changes in the same RBD, a potentially increasing number of S and ACE2 proteins.
That is, the conversion of these two amino acids can be useful in viruses that move towards humans.
It is important to remember that SARS-CoV-2 viruses have similar cell receptors and SARS-CoV.
The difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit of S1 signifies that the ability of the S-S protein connect to ACE2 of humans may have changed.
Of course, the cryo-EM study shows the chances of a 10- to 20-more son’s son’s offspring than between the ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will be interesting to identify whether any other identifiers may be required for the SARS-CoV-2 distribution.
Interestingly, the HCOV-NL63 also you don't want at ACE2 but for different S parts.
There are many HCIV receptors, such as HCOV-229E, and anti- gluttonyated HCOV-OC43.
They can also lead to the spread of these Covid-19 virus in humans after being transmitted between creatures from their carrying animals.
Along with cell receptors, the results of the transmission of HCV between organisms are also governed by the dependence and other carriers and preventive criteria.
The difference of these animal proteins of humans and natural drivers of the HCOV virus storage such as exists, the longest camels and other animals may have a barrier to supply between organisms.
The HCOV virus should contain components of the virus carrier’s dependence and convert the virus to the transmission of the virus to the transmission of the virus between the organisms.
With this technician, the molecular organisms in this vital interactive part of the virus and its candidate have not yet been identified and classified.
A thorough inspection of self-determined toothpastor parameters and SARS-CoV-2 prevention parameters using its type CRISPR technology may bear fruit.
The emergence of the new HIV virus: the back completely
The range of bat CoV offers opportunities to emerge with new HcoV.
For this logic, the virus is used as a collection of HcoV away.
Despite this, rapid flexibility and genetics also facilitates the growth of HCV and become two important steps in this process.
For example, getting or losing a new gene that codes the protein is likely to quickly change the virus sample.
Among the ARS-CoV access proteins, ORF8 is thought to be useful in human-oriented, since SARS-CoV-related viruses were issued but were found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The features of the 29-rays of SARS-CoV nucleotides are found in the sample being allocated at the beginning of the human disaster.
This search becomes an ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a shift shift that enables the conversion of virus carriers.
Similarly, SARS-CoV is likely to have a history of attachment to alpha- and gamma-CoVs generations, where a large number of small areas of connectivity were identified in the RNA polymeres.
The integrated areas were also identified in nsp9, many nsp10 and nsp14 parts.
Similarly, it was shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic witnessed connection events between different generations, which came from the longest camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and Mers-CoV, reconnecting events to another type of HCoV have been witnessed as well, where the HCoV away reunited with other animal Covid-virus on their non-formed genes.
Alerts should also be remembered that artificial selection can contribute to unexplained changes in viral toothpaste, often due to deforming a selection pressure, such as a patient’s immune system.
An example of these effects is lost in full length of ORF4 in the original HCOV-229E sample, given the cancellation of two nucleotides.
With the ORF4 consistent with the possibility of exposure to existing viruses and camels associated with HCV-229E, the alpha-CoV virus found in the alpaca showed a set of same nucleotides, resulting in a shift of the frame.
Finally, the development of new HIV virus is also due to the selection pressure on the virus carrier storage.
The absence of symptoms or symptoms of the amount were discovered when they were infected with coV, referring to the joint improvement between CoV and pos.
It seemed that the CoV virus that went towards the well-defined structural and performance of the body.
For example, an error in response to the infection situation within the panel succeeded in reducing the risk of causing a disease caused by coV.
Similarly, natural deforestation cell activity is determined by the birth of NKG2/CD94 natural cell receptors and lower levels of tissueic exposure.
In addition, a high amount of types of oxygen (ROS) produced due to multiple transactions in the body of the exists can exceed the load of the CoV and affect the diagnosis review, thus providing the pressure for the type of virus that has the ability to cause the disease to be inserted into a new environment.
More samples to cause COV disease can grow through reconnect, resulting in a new protein availability or protein attributes for directing on the carrier.
Hence, it is not fortunate that three new HIV-positive viruses have emerged over the last two decades.
The CoV virus is not able to cause illness or causes the symptoms of an extent to their conduits such as battalion and camels.
It is produced in bulk without showing the consistent immune agreements of its carrier.
Here’s a secret about why non-existent virus carriers are found and which causes severe cases in human transmission.
Several symptoms are often due to highly motivated by the immune system of the body to overcome the volume and explosion of the cytokines where the immune system is very stable, the lungs become worse.
On the other hand, in irrigators, the immune response of the body is derived from the CoV production.
The similar strategy to separating the immune mechanism of the body can be beneficial in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The impact of proteins provided by the virus is particularly stable on the panel.
Thus, protein casting is provided by I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the completion of the NLRP3 inflamsome on the spot tends to be harmful.
With this logic, the LRP3 inflamed inhibitor using MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a general style where SARS-CoV virus and Mers-CoV evolved.
Although the beta-CoV virus consists of 95% nucleotide and SARS-CoV are available, there are also viruses with a sequence of 96% nucleotide and SARS-CoV-2.
Although the levels and other animals in the market have been found to have a virus similar to SARS-CoV, the closest carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are not recognized.
Beta-CoVs supported for domains that are very similar to SARS-CoV-2 are available, this indicates that cocoa can be centralized carriers or beta-coV virus available for cocoa to see they can contribute to the gene fragments for the last type of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions still remain remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is made of humans with intentionally.
The CoV virus is re-entered due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of the Covid-19 virus within the presence and other animals has quickly changed our attitudes about the importance of the causes of HcoV’s animals and storage of HCV in human distribution.
The evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are strained from both exists and is distributed to humans through centralized carriers.
Since the infection of SARS-CoV is due to the inter-human discourse to the market, closing the animal markets and killing all the patients would have been successful to end the SARS pandemic.
With the same logic, they saw they should be removed from the animal market to prevent the distribution of animals, due to the discovery of many beta-CoV generations that are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 generations.
However, if and how the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted to humans through gleaning and other mammals remain open in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been present in the longest camels.
These camels are used as an important tool in transport along with the main source of meat, dairy, leather products and cotton products for street people.
They have spread vastly across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to be all camels to control MerS, as made in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to end the constant outbreak of MERS, the motion dimension should be taken to create a proper vaccine against the MerS-CoV for camels, as well as other transmission control strategies.
Because we cannot remove these viruses, new types can emerge and cause outbreaks.
Many types of COVID virus transmitted by animals are spread across the wild.
In particular, the Covid-19 virus caused by the animal-trading presence is too diverse.
There are many opportunities where these coronaviruses spread by animals grow and reunited, causing the emergence of other Covid viruses that are further circulated and/or are more dangerous for humans in the future.
Culture of eating wild animals in some areas in China should be left to reduce the compatibility between humans and animals.
Due to the existence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19 problems, a well prepared atmosphere and a counter plan should be installed.
Indeed, most of the virus has been in the world for a long time.
This virus resides in their natural storage until there is a chance of spreading it.
While there are many qualities that can spread to the virus, human space based on the presence and other wild creatures can be reduced if people are trained to stay away from those animals.
It is important to continue animals to better understand the ecology of their organic carriers, which manifests that it is important to prevent the distribution from the animal to the future.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent transmission of viruses from animals is for humans to stay away from the ecological environment of native viruses distributed from animals.
There are still many unknown things about SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, if the panel distributes the traditional SARS-CoV-2 virus for the cocoa, it will be interesting to see which situation exists and the cocoa can be found in the same ecological environment.
Secondly, if the exists have a more direct position in the distribution to humans, it should be noted how humans interact with the panel.
Thirdly, if the third mammals serve as a real medium carrier, it should be described as the same animal interacts with other creatures including humans, where they are and they see.
Finally, since other animals including household animals can be at risk of getting SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic and experimental infections should be operated.
If it’s a blind, they saw or the other animal, it’s expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its viruses produced that are almost identical to its original carryers in the future.
Continuously in this field will realize the growth path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and the necessary effect if in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
To update the testing procedure of a “tested” test and “tested” of COVID-19 is essential
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide to exploring and treatment of new coronavirus infections 2019 (2019-nCoV), and the guide provided our experience and set up a good reference for the fight for this big pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our knowledge and expertise continues to be based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice; hence, testing strategies and treatment are also maintained.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guide and we provided the most “modernized” testing mechanism and “moderate” as per the latest Testing and Medical Guidelines of COVID-19 ( seventh edition) issued by the People’s Republic of China’s Republic of Tanzania’s Health Committee.
In December 2019, new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused a outbreak, which is now official as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its viruses have been given the name of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a major disaster.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team has designed a quick and published online consultancy guide on Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
You have attracted great attention from his publication.
However, remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, our insights and skills are growing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical experience, thus, diagnostic strategies and treatment also continues to be updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Guidelines issued by the People’s Health Committee (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, provided the total of seven editions as some of the contexts changed the content.
Now our guide received feedback from Zhou and colleagues. They brought a simple proposal to get a score based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and also made a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recommend their essential work and give our thanks.
However, their work also needs to be updated based on the latest COVID-19 Testing and Medical Guide ( seventh trial version) and recent research.
According to the seventh version (March 3, 2020), confirming suspected cases requires that you include any other aspect of theological history and two aspects of clinical manifestations in order to make a survey or needs to satisfy three medical exposures if there is no open history:
The history of epidemiology: (1) the history of traveling or living in Wuhan and other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the past 14 days before the start of symptoms; (2) the history of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive measure of disease).
Medical exposure: (1) The body mass and/or symptoms of asthma; (2) the visible characteristics of the transmission of COVID-19; (3) the total number of blood cells that reflect the normal, lowered the blood cell in the early phase.
Testing of proven case should be based on any suspicious aspect of disease evidence: (1) the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in real-time through PCR tests; (2) the entire virus's genome that reflects a significant model and new coronaviruses are known; (3) the absence of IgM and IgG-CoV-2 specific antibody of SARS-CoV-2 in the case of IgG’s 4 times and more times during the recovery phase of the recovery phase of the worst disease.
We can see that the exact amount of time the PCR for a nuclear acid on the path of breath or blood sample was added to the second version (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020.).
The pathological detection of blood sample was added to the fourth version (on January 27, 2020) and the fifth version (on February 8, 2020); and the geological evidence was added to the seventh version.
These amendments based on researchers continued to seek effective nuclear acid packages for quick testing, as well as samples from the asthma method including a sample, which added access to different samples and helped the brought to positive impact of the specified antibodies in the order.
Besides, there is a lot more evidence that reminds us of the victims and patients who have symptoms in an unusual way with those who have no symptoms.
Thus, the chart of Zhou and colleagues should be updated, because it classified a person without clinical indications that they are “low-risk.”
The score system also needs to be verified in future medical practices and research.
Complete, we hope the most straightforward evidence will arise and we are waiting for readers to give their opinion.
With the testing of the "considered story" and " confirmed story", we recommend compliance with new guidelines for their home countries.
Our team will also update for the proper time our guide to provide support.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, more advanced cases reported every day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed the five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths occurring per day due to the virus.
By yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a number of recorded cases of infection composed of 114 cases and 33 cases of people present at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjay Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjay, two cases were over 60 years old, two out of 51 and 60 years.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 that a major disaster on 11 March.
The hospital official told Anadolu, a local news agency that one of those who lost their lives was Jal Saifur Rahman, a director at the Anti-Corruption Commission in Benin, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video broadcast, Bangladesh’s Minister Oaidul Quader said the public transport would be closed over the time it was originally planned, until the next Saturday.
The closing of this public transport was early on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4.
Transportation of essential products - medical, oil and foods -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, for two people who returned from Italy and also a wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three people were already available.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of coronavirus cases SARS-CoV-2 passed one million across the world, data from Johns Hopkins University showed it.
At least 52 thousand deaths were associated with COVID-19, disease caused by coronavirus.
This scope was reached on that day when Malawi’s country confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia’s first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea announced, by Thursday, that it was one of the few countries that did not contain coronavirus infections.

Stores in Australia reduced the number of papers the person could buy
On the evening of Sunday and Saturday, the Australian shops of Woolworths and Coles supported the purchase of the paper to the two and one you will cry out to each transaction at all shops at the national level.
ALDI also launched a single package limit, on Monday.
These limits were published as messages in the premium areas and on the outlets’ Facebook pages.
Buyers were reported to buy products primarily due to the fear of COVID-19 if people need to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolsworth also put limits on the purchase of a paper in exchange for one package per order.
These changes followed the initial four-package limits for each transaction set by Woolsworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in a press statement on 8 March, reported that even after the four paper package limits were still selling all paper goods within an hour of delivery", and invoking the need to be "intended", while ALDI, on Tuesday stated that "intended".
Sales increased "with a high increase" last week, according to the speaker of Wolsworths.
The Costco Shop in Canberra also set the rates allowed to be two packages last week.
To overcome the deficiencies, Coles brought great packages from the product and increased the time to deliver the goods, Woolworths ordered additional products, while ALDI developed the goods for the early Wednesday programs.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Corporation, said that the exporters try to add products, but local council restrictions on time to deliver goods to the vehicle tightened its citizens.
He expects rising production costs, while supplier products try to meet a few special needs and plans.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that early release of the product, some shops cannot run a special Wednesday program.
On the News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a reference sales specialist from the Queensland University of Technology, said that their shops fill the product every night.
He mentioned that the shirt is a large product, which causes a small number of products and is sold, leaving the large parts of their shelf empty and increasing the feeling of deficiencies.
Coles and Woolworths have a view that if there were enough products on shelves, if the products such as paper washer and can be bought in abundance, there is a possibility of reducing the rebels, said Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
A paper-based company used Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they sold all their products.
Kimberly-Clark, a company that develops Kleex Toilet Tissue and Solaris Paper making Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24/7 to maintain product distribution, according to the News.com.au report.

Original stores didn't want to place restrictions, based on reports from ABC Australia on 3 March where they said they don't have plans to set purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high requirements, including masks, tubers, soap washing hands and powder.
Similarly, out of Australia, on Sunday evening, the British domain of Ocado seemed to reduce the purchase of the adventures of Andres to two paper packages.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the widespread disease of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced the continued outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus — being a major disaster.
Although the term "a major pandemic" denotes the widespread disease, it is not the most common risk, the World Health Organization saw the importance of encouraging nations to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this great pandemic.
If countries realize, testing, treatment, conduct, monitor and encourage their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
We are extremely concerned with the rates of infection and the severity and imaging standards of not acting.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, this major pandemic "unsured."
He said, in comments published by CNN February, "but with cold cold fever, no respiratory virus is monitored from spreading to global spread."
Ghebreyesus commented similar to this, saying “We’ve never seen a big deal caused by the coronavirus.”
He continued, "and we have never seen a great deal controlled at the same time."
The new situation as the World Health Organization’s decision in January to announce the outbreak of the disease as a public health condition of the global crisis.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said about outbreaks of disease, "basic, is going to be worse."
By Thursday, the U.S. Broadcasting Corporation reported at least 12,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The major 2019–20 pandemic of coronavirus is an ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a deadly disease of coronavirus (ARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of disease was identified in Wuhan, China, December 2019, declared the International Health Emergency Agency on 30th January 2020, and recognized as a major disaster on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 21 countries, resulting in about 9,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people are recovered.
The rates of mortality have been estimated 4% in China, while globally are different from 13.04% Algeria to .08% New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and failure to breathe well.
Problems can be combined with a series of lungs and COPD.
When from infected to the appearance of symptoms is usually about five days, but it may be between two to four days.
There is no known vaccine or special treatment for viruses.
The primary treatment is to treat the symptoms of the disease and therapies. The recommended preventive measures include manual washing, cover your mouth when you cough, maintain distance and other people, and monitoring and self-determining of people who suspects are infected.
Organizations around the world have been taken step by putting sanctions on travel, quarantines, movement periods, at work restrictions, and the closure of buildings.
This major pandemic has caused major social and economic chaos, diarrhea or disappointments of spot events, religious, political and cultural events, and the spread of product deficiencies due to fear.
Schools and universities are locked in an international or local basis in 193 countries, impacting approximately 99.4% of the world’s students.
A fiction about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of discrimination from other countries and discrimination against Chinese, other people from Eastern Asia or having the same visibility, and others from sites with multiple virus cases.
Following the reduced transport and closing of large industries, there has been a shortage of air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health agencies Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of an unsourced pulmonary process known on January 31, 2019, and the early study of January 2020.
The visa was related to theHuan Marine Food Market and therefore the virus is thought to have a source of distributed from animals to humans.
The virus that led to outbreaks of disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, new viruses discovered and related to the presence of the virus, the virus, and the SARS-CoV. The first person known to the symptoms was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person did not have any connection in the market.
In the early events reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to have a relationship with the market.
On March 13, 2020, a report unconfirmed from the Chinese Federation of Inquiry said that there is a case that followed up to 17 November 2019, in a 55th-year-old man from Hubei province, it may be the first case. On February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that, how the new cases were reported were reduced to China but further in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside of Chinese visas exceeded the new visas in China for the first time.
They may have been reported in large cases, especially among those with poor symptoms.
By 26 February, at least a few cases reported in young people, those aged 19 and below 2.4% of the world’s political affairs. British general advisor Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of the UK’s population will need to be infected before a successful immunity is obtained through vaccination.
Visa means the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their tested positive according to official protocol.
By 23 March, no country measured more than 3% of the population, and many countries have had an official policy not only to measure those with weak symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A survey published on 16th of March found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these infections were not copied from the cause of infection by 79% of the cases copied.
The survey was published 30 March, and estimated that the number of Italian infections was much more than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the production base numbers (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A screening published by the U.S. Center’s Control and Prevention Center has refused statements that it may be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 do not recover.
For those who do not see, the time from the appearance of symptoms until death has been between 6 and 41 days, the regular day numbers if 14.
By 10 April 2020, about 9,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, by 5 February 80% of deaths were at least 60, and 75% of the health conditions originally combined with cardiovascular diseases and sugar.
The right number of deaths from COVID-19 may be more, since it may not include people who die without being tested - e.g. at home, in nursing rooms, etc.
Only a certain amount of data from Italy found that additional deaths in a larger pandemic exceeded the official statistics of COVID deaths in section 4-5x.
U.S. Control and Prevention Center’s spokesman noted that [the stated figure of death] is a lowly high-frequency report in the United States. The lower condition occurs in a large epidemic, as the first proof of the hit hit hit was Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first deaths outside China on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first out of Asia were France on February 14.
By 28 February, outside China Mainland, more than several deaths recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries had reported deaths, in every continent unless they are affected.
These numbers differ from location and when you exceed, they are affected by the level of testing, the quality of the medical care system, the first type of treatment, and the demographic status like age, gender, and the amount of death to the story reflects the number of cases identified in a certain time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, international death-to-modern ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) reaching 10 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the location.
In China, the estimate of the death rate compared to the incident decreased from 17.3% (for people who had symptoms from 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (other than those who had symptoms from February 1, 2020). Other measures include a death rate for each case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who are infected with HIV.
This data is not blocked by a temporary criterion and follows the specific number of people from the transmission event to be resolved by the case.
Number of scholars have tried to calculate these numbers for a specific population.
The Oxford University Degree Center estimates that the rates of deaths due to a significant pandemic are between 0.1% and 0.39%.
Higher estimates of this percentage corresponds to results from randomly tested for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical analysis to detect the testing effect of CFR projection.
The World Health Organization claims that this major pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the outbreak of this disease is unknown and may differ from location.
Maciej Boni of the University of Penn State said, "Unless you be monitored, the outbreak of transmission usually begins when the disease is endowed.
But it's hard to estimate or to have a strong projection present about that time when it's.
The head of the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, said that "we may cease to reach June" if all countries are empowered to adhere to the International Health Organization's advice for measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski Institute of Health Sciences & Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, there is a possibility of one or two year".
According to the Imperial College survey led by Neil Ferguson, maintaining distances and other actions will be required "up to the vaccines are available (under 18 months or older)".
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt University said, “I think there is no possibility that this coronavirus—because it is easily transmitted—will completely disappear” and may be “as a seasoned disease, when it happens every year”.
The situation that the turn-out will depend on the coverage level of the virus changes.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be specific and people are infected that they do not reflect any symptoms.
The common two symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Inexpensive symptoms include fatigue, respiratory urination (coughing), well breathing feeling, muscle pain and limbs, throat pain, injury and head, cooling, vomiting, bleeding, or skin have about one of the six feet and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention maintains emergency symptoms as a failure to properly breathe, persistent chest pains or tangles, sudden inflammation, surface or blue lips; urgent treatment is recommended if these symptoms exist.
Some of the infected people may not show any symptoms, without any medical indications but their findings have been transmitted, so researchers have given advice that those who have contacted should be monitored and checked to eliminate infection concerns.
Chinese rate a series of do not show symptoms from a few to 44%.
The normal period of the presence of symptoms (a period of exposure and symptoms) usually occurs one day up to 14 days; usually it is five days. For example of the uncertainty, as much as part of people with COVID-19 who lost their mood was previously 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Other information about how this disease is still being transmitted.
This disease is believed primarily when it is close to the droplets originating from the time of cough, sneez, or speaking; and a person about 1 to 2 m (3 feet to 6).
Studies have found that coughing without blemishing can enable droplets to 4.5 meters (15 feet) up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have also suggested that these virus can be transmitted to small drops running longer in the air, which can from the time of the conversation. The respiratory drops can also be from the respiratory moment, as well as when talking, but these viruses are generally not transmitted through the air.
These drops can reach the lips or lungs of people around or dragged to the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as the timing and animation of the heart and lungs (CPR) can make the water to breathe in the air and therefore be distributed through the air.
It can also be distributed when someone touchs a viral component, including the skin, and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is doubt that it can be distributed by the stool, the risk is believed to be inferior.
The Chinese government challenged the possibility of disassembled from the backdrop of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is infected three days after the appearance of symptoms, although it is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of disease.
People have been tested and found positive for disease to three days before the appearance of symptoms indicates that it is possible before many symptoms have occurred.
There are only a few confirmed cases in the lab of people who do not show any symptoms but have viruses, but cases of infected people and who do not show symptoms are identified by other countries when monitoring people who interact with patients.
The Center for the Prevention and Control of the European Disease (ECD) states that although it is not fully effective for this disease spread, one person is generally infecting two or three persons.
In particular, the virus was found to be able to be discovered up to three days on the plastic and stainless steel does not enter 304 landings, for one day on a cardboard, and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, differ according to the humidity and temperature absorption levels. Likes and other animals have been found by COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit this virus to humans, but Britain’s authority advises them to wash hands after touching the animals, as after touching the infected people may touch them.
The COPD (SARS-CoV-2) is a foreign virus, first acquired three persons with a process of lung lung disease linked to the respiratory cases of Wuhan.
Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are occurring in the coronavirus related globally. Outside the human body, the virus is consumed by the intended use detergent. SARS-CoV-2 has a close association with SARS-CoV-2.
It is thought that infections from animals to humans.
The analysis of inheritance particles has shown that the coronavirus is connected to the coronavirus cell, in a small category of the Sarbe virus (generation B) along with two types from the panel.
It is analogous to 96% in standard particles for other coronavirus samples in the domains (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there are only one distinction of amino acids in a particular part of the mechanism of the particles between the virus from the brain.
All particles' compares so far have found in up to 92% of the particles material found in the cocoa virus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove to be a central parasites.
The transmission of the virus can be identified over time based on symptoms, but the evidence is following the method of returning chemical particles and a series reaction (RRT-PCR) of infected water or medical CT-based diagnosis.
The screen matching PCR and CT in Wuhan has recommended that the CT is higher than PCR, although not specific, and its image components interact with other wool flames and disease procedures.
By March 2020, the U.S. College suggests that “CT is not allowed to filter or as a first measure to realize COVID-19”.
WHO has published a multi-disciplinary call for SARS-CoV-2 testing protocol, and the first post was issued on 17th January.
The test uses the return of the chemical particles and a series reaction (RRT-PCR).
The test can be made of respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally this test is carried out using cotton inside the nose although taking the sample in the mouth can also be used. Several laboratory and companies develop a clinical attempt, identifying body immunity.
By 6 April 2020, there is no evidence of this to be validated for use by many.
The United States blood test is designed with Cellex approved for emergency use by authorized laboratories only.
The characteristics of radiology images and medical images of the computer (CT) of people who have been infected include a low-pressure pulmonary part of the urinary tract between chest and lung walls.
The Italian Radiology party collects an online database of certified medical images.
Due to the other transmission such as adenovirus, providing visualizations without proving through the PCR has a lack of specific issues in identifying COVID-19.
China showed that although medical images are not specific to transmission, they are fast and effective, showing their consideration as filtering in areas of disaster.
The online programs designed by nature are designed to discover the medical features of viruses and medical images and CT.
The disease prevention strategies include maintaining personal hygiene in general, handwashing, handwashing, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed, and coughing or sneezing into tissue and placing the tissue directly into the desired vessel.
Those who may have been infected are already advised to wear a medical mask at public.
The measures to maintain distance are also recommended to prevent the supply. Many governments have restricted or counseling against any unimportant journey towards and from countries and regions affected by disease outbreaks.
However, the virus has reached a move to spread the community in several parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within the community and some community members do not know where or how they have been infected by someone who may have been exposed to use common precautions, the attention of the eye protection.
The use of location data from mobile phones and governments for these use has driven over privacy, and a Amnesty International organization and over 100 other organizations will make an ad wishing to be set to such surveillance.
A separate mobile application has been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and by April 7, 2020, more than twelve categories of experts were creating a private solution, such as using Bluetooth to send a user distance and other mobile phones.
Users then receive messages if they have been around anyone who is tested and found by COVID-19. Falseity extends about how to prevent transmission; for example, the cleaning of nose and snuffing combinations are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are busy making one.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends people wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands seem dirty; before eating; after planting, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is consumed by the use soap at home, which gives its protection foam.
CDC proposes more to use mobile liquid for killing at least 60% of alcohol intake while soap and water is not readily available.
WHO recommends people from eyes, nose, or mouth and hands that are not washed.
The components used can be cleaned and disinfected with different chemicals (in one minute using chemicals for the part with stainless steel entry), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5%povidone-idine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chohexidine gluconate, have not been very successful.
CDC suggests that if the COVID case is suspected or certified in a building such as office or childcare, every part such as office, bathroom, living room, electronic equipment like a flat computer, touches, keyboard, remote controls, and ATM machine used by patients, should be cleaned by disinfectants.
Health agencies suggest that people cover their mouths and nose with a fold or tissue when they cough or sneez, and give us any tissue at once.
Medical mask is recommended for those who may have been infected, since wearing masks can control the amount and distance of transmission drops when it comes to, cough, and cough.
WHO has provided timely instructions and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at Leeds University, “Saving masks can reduce their physical strength, which is a major source of infection without better hand hygiene.”
WHO recommends masking healthy people only at risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, although they have also admitted that wearing masks may also help people touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks and public people.
The United States, CDC proposes to wear a non-clinically modified mask. China has specifically recommended use of a medical mask that can be cast out by people with good public health, especially when approaching (1 feet 3) or less) and other people.
Hong Kong proposes to wear on a medical mask when using public transport or staying in a place where there are many people.
Thailand health officials encourage people to make masks using fabrics at home and daily washing them.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned out of the public without wearing bars or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear masks while going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austria government ordered everyone who enters the store must wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear a mask publicly.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks every day from March, needed passengers in the train and city bus to wear surface masks on 1st day.
Panama has made it necessary to wear masks whenever you go out, but also recommends the production of bar showers at home for those who can’t buy masks.
Blessings are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Stay off of the community (also known as not to be accompanied by people) include control actions that are bought to reduce the spread of disease by reducing interpersonal contactes.
Methods include; barriers to travel; closed schools, work areas, plots, movies, or shops.
People can follow the methods of staying away from the community by staying at home, reducing the journey, leaving a place with many people, communicating without contact, and maintaining distances with other people.
Many governments have now ordered or suggested to be accompanied by people in affected areas and outbreaks of disease.
The scale of a population proposed by US government agencies and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no transmission of COVID-19 in a given area) up to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned a public gathering over two people. The elderly people with healthy conditions such as diabetes, heart disease disease, hypertension, and acute immune system, and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the outbreak of the community. Going towards the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change the term "depending on people" and "being", explaining that the goal is to direct contact while maintaining social relations, whether online or at a distance.
The use of the term "rested off the society" has caused the pharmacist that people should engage in social exclusion, rather than encourage continuing to communicate with others through alternative means.
These include suggestions only in relation to someone you live with, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Homelessness is recommended for those who have been exposed to COVID-19 and those suspects have been infected.
Health agencies have provided detailed self-isolation instructions at home in a reasonable manner. Many governments have ordered or suggested the people’s quarantine in affected areas.
Several orders regarding quarantines are provided for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have had a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to the country or area with large distributions have been advised to quarantine for 14 days from the last time possible and infected.
Strategies in control of disease outbreaks are inhibiting or suppressing, and avoiding.
Controlled is driven in early stages of the outbreak and aims to monitor and exclude infected people as well as bring other measures to control infections and vaccines to end the spread of other people.
If it is no longer able to control the spread of disease, the effort is then transferred to the recovery phase: the measures are taken to reduce the spread and depreciation of its impact on the health and the community’s treatment system.
The combination of preventive and avoidive measures may be carried out together.
Prevention requires a difficult step to reverse a large pandemic by reducing the production base under 1. The response part of the disease is trying to reduce the epilepsy, known as the balancing of an outbreak.
This reduces the risk of health care to be measured and provides more time for vaccine and treatment to be developed.
The non-profit strategies that can control this outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand washing, masking face masks and socializing; community measures are focused on social distancing and social distancing; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such strategies; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning areas. The more progress aimed at controlling the outbreak was carried out, such as putting the entire city in quarantine and setting a strong ban against transport.
Some countries have also implemented a lot of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched a public test with local regulations, providing attention to the transportation of infected people.
Singapore donated financial support to those infected with quarantine and high commissioning to those who missed it.
Taiwan added the manufacture of facial masks and fine charging by storing medical products.
The best policies of avoiding disease may reduce the need for medical care during the first 2/3 and deaths per half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems to be weighed down.
To suppression is preferable but it needs to be maintained as all the virus is spreading in the population (or until the vaccines are available, that first), or distributed or not again arises as soon as the action is turned on.
Long-term strategies for epidemics cause social and economic costs.
There is no approved COVID-19 virus medication, but the function of developing them continues, as well as testing for existing medications.
Using drugs bought without a prescription, drinking water, and relaxing can help reduce the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, the cure for air gain, dripping, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of muscle building may improve the results.
Several chemicals previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are checked for use to treat COVID-19.
WHO also stated that “some local and home solutions” can provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing the chances and flexibility of health care for COVID-19 needs is defined by WHO as the primary stage of response and outbreak of disease.
ECDC and the Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have provided hospital guidelines and basic resource-focused health care at several levels, including focusing on laboratory services by testing COVID-19, cutting off and disparizing patients with COVID-19, and increasing the ability of high-quality care by teaching staff and increasing the number of supporting respiratory care and beds.
There are many theories about the first case (known as the first patient) may occur.
The first known coronavirus case can be tracked up to 1 December 2019, Wuhan, Hubei, China.
During one month, the coronavirus virus number hue increased pole.
These were associated with the Total Fish Huan Market, which also sold alive animals, and the same theory is that the virus came through one of these species; or, in other words, has the source of animals from animals to humans. The pulmonary processes that have been identified on 26 December and treated by a Doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hub Hospital, who informed the CDC in Jianghan on 27 December.
On the 30th of December, a group of doctors in the Central Wuhan Hospital were attracted to the "viral coronavirus".
Four of these doctors, including Li Wenling, were exploited by the police by spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was sworn by her boss for warning.
Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later with public notice on 31 December and informing WHO.
Enough cases of unspecified lungs were reported to the health authorities Wuhan caused the early January exam. In the early stages of the explosion, visa numbers were doubled every seven days and a half.
In the beginning and between January 2020, the virus spreads to other regions of China, financed by Chinese New Year and Wuhan as a centre for transportation and a central rail exchange center.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases a day, including two Beijing people and one in Shenzhen.
Later on, the official data suggests that 6,174 people were willing to reach 20 January 2020. By March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 7.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 970,000 people died and more than ever.
About 200 countries and communities have had at least one occasion.
Due to the major European pandemic, many countries in the Schengen Area have blocked the journey between them and keeping control over the border.
The national response has included regulatory measures such as quarantine (known as homework orders, place-to-date or close to 2 April, nearly 300 million people or around 90% of the population are under the most common closures in the United States, more than 50 million and about 59 million people have been confined to normal activities in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people in the world were subjected to temporary closure, which increased to 2.6 billion people later—approximately a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 is tracked back to 1 December 2019 Wuhan; one confirmed report claims that the first case was in November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jijian observed groups of pulmonary disorders that are unknown on 26 December, following this hospital informed Wuhan Jianan CDC in 27 December.
The initial dimensions of patient sample on December 27, 2019 suggested the existence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
Public Notice was issued by Wuhan municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed that day.
When these reports occurred, the physicians Wuhan were exploited by police for “spread rumors” about explosions.

The outbreak of coronavirus could lead to a total of 47 million people in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the United States Agency for the Indian Commissioner for Human Rights (paid) without work.The study from the Institute of Angus Reid found that 44% of the Canadian homes were affected by a different type of work in Spain since the closure of normal activities in March 2020.
In the second phase of March, 4 million French workers sent requests to be unemployed and 1 million British employees sent a loan application to all. About half a million German companies have sent their employees in a program funded by a short-term government known as Kuzarbeit.
A short-term German career plan has also been used by France and Britain.
The industry’s performance and cultural establishments have been greatly affected by this major pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals—internationally employed.
Organizations in the arts and culture have tried to approve their goal (which is usually financed by the public) to provide access to cultural practices to communities, to maintain the security of their employers and to support potential artists.
By March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museum, acting halls, and other cultural institutions had been temporarily confined to their fairs, events and acting canceled or postponed.
In response there was a lot of effort to provide alternative services through online platforms. Another ever-changing event because of this disease is eradicative of religious worship, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and exhibitions, technology forums, and fashion shows.
The movie industry has also found a conflict. The Vatican announced that the anniversary of the Great Week Rome, which is the last week of the Christmas season, has been abolished.
Several Diocese have suggested early Christians staying home but not participating in Mass Sunday; some churches have made church worship through radio, live or television, while others have a worship of the participants coming to the car.
Following the Roman Catholic Diocese of fasting their churches and small churches and the St. Peter’s Feasts, other religious organizations also sought their worship and control the congregation in churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, churches, and gurdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellations of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and the temples were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of the pilgrims as well as citizens toward sacred places Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has led the world's largest disturbances to play the World War II.
Most sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 European UEFA, the 2019–20 NBA season, and the 2019–20 NHL season.
This outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which had been planned to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that “will be strengthened to the other day after 2020 but not beyond the summer sessions of 2021”.
This has led many gamblers to online, and many online gambling sites report a significant increase in enrollment rates.The entertainment industry has also been affected, and many music groups to stop or delete performance trips.
A multi-games such as Broadway also stopped dramas.
Some artists have tried ways to continue creating and distribute work through the internet as an alternative to live shows, such as live performances online or create “ concerts” online artists to entertain people, distribute, and develop their work.
Many photos of porn content have spread across the internet while many people turn to humor and customization even when there is a state of the document.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the increase in prejudices that people from other countries, racism have been seen by people from China or Central Asia, and against people from the most affected parts of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Events of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been found in many countries, especially in Europe, Central Asia, North America, and the Asia Pacific region.
A report from February (where many cases were still China) witnessed racist feelings led to different groups in the Chinese world to qualify for a virus or receive the right punishment.
Some African countries have felt against Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on the location they leave.
There have been support for Chinese, online and out, and for those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the continuing of this outbreak in other countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe through a fatal COVID-19 outbreak, they would also go through suspected situations against foreigners. Citizens in Malaysia, Zanzibar, Singapore and South Korea previously signed a move to prevent the people from entering their country in an effort to prevent this disease.
In Japan, a rail mark #ChineseDontComeToJapan captured on Twitter.
People of China and other politicians in the UK and the United States have reported high levels of racial violence, including attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been arrested for referring to the coronavirus as "China", a statement considered by the right to be racial and discriminatory in China.
The protestors in Ukraine attacked a boat carrying Ukraine and visitors saved from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the North East of India, use it until one and China and read in major Indian cities reported through the abuse situation related to the outbreak of coronavirus.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Society in West Bengal, mentioned that the Chinese people had destroyed natural resources and "that is why God decided to avenge against them."
The comments were later accused of Chinese embassy Kolkata, terming that "disputation". In China, the exception of people from other countries and racism against the residents who are not Chinese has increased following this pandemic, and the visitors called "willing the visitor" and the target for "puted".
Many registered newspapers have removed for some or for all information about the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers wrote scientific papers related to the outbreak obtained by the independent means of access.
Other scientists decided to forward their results quickly into automated servers such as bioRxiv.

Coronavirus disease tests 2019 (COVID-19) and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2, including anti-inflammatory methods.
The presence of the virus in the virus is proven by the RT-PCR, which detects the RNA protein of the coronavirus.
This measurement is specific and configured to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA protein only.
It is used to verify recent or ongoing transmission.
Intersection (serology) can be used in investigations along with monitoring of people.
Antibiotics show the number of people who were diagnosed including those whose symptoms were too low to be reported or those who did not show any symptoms.
The precise death rate caused by this disease and the immune level of the body among people can be identified as a result of this measure.
Due to the minimum testing standards, reaching in March 2020 there are no reliable countries regarding the spread of the virus among its people.
By March 23, no country has measured more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests carried out in a far country.
This state of diversity also has a significant impact on cases of death, which is more likely to be overly estimated in some countries.
Using a real-time dose of (RRT-PCR) testing can be done on the sample of asthma found in a far away, including sample of phonograph products or cough sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The measurement of the RT-PCR being performed using the laptops is only dependent on the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can be lost in the throat as they continue to reproduce in the lungs.
For infected people in the second week, alternative sample devices can be taken from the depth of respiratory tracts through a physical or cough (the cough) can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was created in Charité Berlin in January 2020 using a real-time dose of 250,000 packages distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British country had also made a measure on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech, designed a bundle of discovery SARS-CoV-2 that relies on clinical status PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
Browsing the name of "E" concerned in all beta- coronaviruses, and RdRp’s in which are mainly available in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive an urgent use consent from the SARS-CoV-2 National Product Management in China for PCR detection package in the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its real-time PCR Case Panel of COVID 2019 (2019-nCoV) for public health laboratory through the International Health Resources.
One of the three genetic tests in previous versions of testing packages caused non-permanent exposure from measuring instruments, and testing analytics at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to the average number of 100 samples being successfully tested in the entire period of February 2020.
The tests for using the premises are not specified as dependent on up to 28 February 2020, were until this time that the national and street laboratories were allowed to run the tests.
The measurement was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Management Act. The U.S. commercial laboratory started to do the tests in March 2020.
By March 5, 2020 LaCorp announced the COVID-19 test in the nation using RT-PCR.
The Quest Diagnostics Such did the COVID-19 tests accessible on March 9, 2020.
No limits for declared standards; the collection and processing of samples must be made in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was created and produced by the National Research Centre for Vario and Bayotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020 a measure was registered by the Federal Medical Monitor Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to form a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received a approval from the FDA for a measure that would be carried out within 3.5 hours above, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests for 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA provided emergency spending certification (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories in a measurement of m2000 system; the FDA had originally given the same approval to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the same EUA approval from FDA for the measure taking about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved the use of nuclear acid production technology that relies on the steady dose of heat fibers rather than PCR.
Because this measurement does not require flexible heat fibers, this technique can produce positive in a short period of five minutes and negative results in the duration of 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States and Abbott expects to multiply production to produce 50,000 tests per day. The similar dose of nucleocapsid protein (N) of the new coronavirus is formed in Taiwan, with confidence that they will deliver the result after 15 to 20 minutes as only the cases of cold cold cold fever.
In March 2020 it concluded that “ chest tests are worth under investigation in the initial phase, with the CT output [physical organs shown by the computer] to be replaced even before the appearance of symptoms.”
Common features on CT include two-line glass of rock lifts that block the brightness of the angle, not compatible and back.
The presence of Subpleural in bulk, poor path and durability becomes diseased when it comes to growing.
The screen matching PCR and CT in Wuhan is recommended that the CT is significantly better than the PCR, although not specifically with its many other image components to interact with the other lungs and disease procedures.
As of March 2020, the U.S. Academy of Radio suggests that “CT should not be used to investigate or phase first of tests to detect COVID-19”. By March 2020, the CDC center suggests PCR is used in preliminary investigations.
The immune area of the body to cope with infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to diagnose infection within 7 days after the start of symptoms, the prevention of body, and monitoring of people. Trials can be carried out in the middle of the care (CLT) or by testing in the areas of care (PoCT).
Automatic physical diagnostic systems in many clinical trials will be able to implement these trials but their availability will depend on the production level of each system.
With a single  CLT one of the peripheral blood samples used, although the chronic samples can be used to monitor the immune response of the body.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually available due to skin absorption.
Unlike the PCR action methods are required before the experiment. On March 26, 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 organizations reporting to the organization currently have the ability to distribute their antibodies.
By April 7, 2020, the only single test has been approved by the FDA under the use of emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epopemun Diagnostics received European authorizations of their metrics packages, which can detect IgG and IgaA antibodies against the virus in the blood sample.
The testing capacity is hundreds of samples within the clock and is much faster than the standard test of virus RNA.
Antibos can usually be detected 14 days after the start of transmission. Early April, the UK found that there is no antibody volume package that bought to be the best to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a deal where suspected patients can stay at home, "urgent department will give the patient a sample bottle", restoring it and getting a result of tests over time. The UK NHS announced that it makes attempts to test suspected patients at home, which eliminates the risk of infection in the hospital or have to be in contact with the patient.
The vehicle’s facilities have helped South Korea to implement some of the fastest and most expensive metrics than any country. In Germany, the National Health Insurance Act said on March 2, it had an estimated 12,000 tests every day in the order of ambulances and 10.700 people had tested a week ago.
Cost is assessed by health insurance when the measurement is commissioned by the doctor.
According to Robert Koch Institute’s president, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests each week.
By 19 March tests through the vehicle were conducted in several large cities.
By March 26, 2020 the total number of tests implemented in Germany was unknown, because the result was only reported.
The first lab research showed that by reaching the 12/2020 weekly total of 483,295 samples were measured to and including 12/2020 weeks and 33,491 (6.9%) were found to have SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion Hospital and Rambam noted the sample method from 64 patients at the same time, by setting together with more samples and testing if the combination of sample is available to be affected.
And construction managed by the BGI Wang Jian founder and completed in 5 days, the projections showed Hubei visa would be 47% more and the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be double if this level of testing was not established.
Wuhan lab has been followed quickly by Hua-Yan lab in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities across China.
By March 4, 2020 the total daily possible was 50,000 daily tests. Different models generated by Origami Assassins have been able to measure the amount of 1122 COVID19 sample with only 93 parameters. These models can be used in small lab without needing to respond to water.
As of March, low rates of metrics have become a challenge for public testing the EU and the United States.
This has led the publishers to examine the procedures for the sample production in the heat of 98°C (208°F) by 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for more tests. On March 31 it was announced that the Arabic Intellectual Property Union was now testing more people with coronavirus than any other country, and it was running to multiply testing standards to reach higher population.
This was through the inclusion of the ability to cater when they have the purchase of large numbers of people from Group 42 and BGI (according to their emergency discovery lab of "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built-in 14 days, this lab has the ability to make thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first ever in the world with this ability to be used outside of China.
Various criteria for measuring different parts of the coronavirus genetic procedure were created in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) started using the German resipation of the package sent to low income nations without the ability to form their own.
The German response was published on 17 January 2020; a protocol developed by the U.S. Center and Prevention Center was not available up to 28 January, and lately reviewed the metrics in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the effectiveness of nuclear equipment, and these countries and Australia could not provide adequate supplies according to the needs and recommendations of health experts.
In comparison, experts say that access to testing in many areas in South Korea helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
The ability to measure, greatly in the personal sector's laboratory, was built for a long period of time with South Korea's government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for military initiatives as a means to reduce the spread of a major COVID-19 pandemic. The high need for screening packages due to the spread of multiple viruses resulting in a tens of thousands of metrics across the U.S. private laboratory, and was limited to chemical distribution.
In March 2020 China reported problems in the accuracy of testing packages.
In the United States, the testing packages created by the CDC were “lacking limitations,” the government then cleared the barriers that prevented personal testing. The Spanish country bought testing packages from the Chinese Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., but found that the results of the metrics were not accurate.
The organization explained that these incorrect results may arise from collecting samples or not using packages accordingly.
The ministry said that it would replace the incorrect result, and it would use the packages provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy instead.80% of the testing packages that the Czech Republic purchased from China provided 1.2 million packages that were available to offer accurate results.
The Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the dumped on the Danube.Ateş Kara from the Ministry of Health said that the package of testing that the country of Turkey purchased from China had a "high level of offense" and "the British land bought 3.5 million packages from China but early in April 2020 announced that it could not be used.
Testing, followed by a quarantine for those tested and tested by disease and traced to those who are accompanied by SARS-CoV-2, occurred in the result of exposure.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first death case area from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two phases of metrics for the whole population of 3,400 people, approximately ten days’s diversity.
About half of the people diagnosed with disease had no symptoms and all cases were found in the quarantine.
While transport is regulated, this completely removed the new infection.
With an ambitious plan to track people who have contacted, barriers to internal transport, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has spread pole over other developed countries, but without the worst barriers such as forcing restaurants and returning stores.
Many events have been interrupted by Singapore to advise residents stay at the home on March 28, but schools were reopened for a period of time on March 23.
Many countries have also controlled this vast pandemic with an ambitious approach to monitoring people who have touched, barriers to transport within countries, testing and quarantine, but at a low level of closeness of common activities, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study has shown that the nations that have tested more, compared to the number of deaths, have lower levels of cases, perhaps because of these nations to be able to discover those with average symptoms or without symptoms.
WHO suggests that countries with no ability to measure and lower national information about COVID-19 have identified the first five cases of the disease with the first ten COVID-19 samples in one of the 16 WHO’s first COVID-19 related laboratory for verification testing.
Out of the respective 16 continents, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 Africa, 1 North America and 1 Australia.
In the following chart, an “The case of disease as % of tests” is motivated by the testing policy.
The country only measured hospitalization will have a high number of cases of disease as % measurements above the country that measures all citizens, whether they indicate symptoms or not, other factors are equal.
Washing hands (or handwash), which is also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing sand, dirt, germs or other missing objects.
Washing hands with soap every time in "some critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example running and twists, which are distributed through a stool path to arrive mouth.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as colds or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. inchne with water).
At five crucial times during the day when brushing the hand is important: before going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby’s toilet or changing the diaper, before giving the baby a meal and after preparing a fresh, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends manual washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of the patient.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby who has gone to the toilet.
After you plan the priests, cough or sneez.
After keeping the beast, the food of the beast, or the stool of the beast.
Medical hand hygiene refers to cleanliness activities related to clinical procedures.
Washing hands before offering medicine or treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main purpose of manual washing is to clean the hands from viruses (bacter, viruses, or other organisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause disease or disease.
This is especially important for people who take care of food or work in a medical field, but it is also an important overall practice.
Washing hands are many health benefits, including reducing the spread of cold fever, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes; reducing infectious diseases;
and reduce infant mortality during home delivery.
A 2013 study showed that manual washing can lead to low-quality improvement in children under five years of age.
In developing nations, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and can be prevented by setting up flexible dynamics, such as soap washing.
This simple act can reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50%.
The strategies that encourage people to wash their hands can reduce the operating periods for about a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low income zones.
48% of the decrease of the operation periods may be associated with the washing of hands by soap. The washing of hands is one of the most effective ways to prevent and infection of respiratory disease (ARI), as a common practice followed in home, at school and in communities around the world.
Nimonia, the type of the main AR, is the number of children under five years of age, killing approximately 1.8 million children every year.
Operating with the ammonia jointly contributes to about 3.5 million children’s deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, manual washing before eating and after using toilet practices can save more life than any vaccine or medical strategy, reduce death due to over half and deaths from a quarterly infection.
Hand wash is usually included for other cleaning strategies like water segment, sanitation and hygiene (SHOA) planning.
The washing hands also prevents the absorption of a person who is circulated through the direct contact of the body.
A slight reaction to washing hands is that manual washing can always cause damage to the skin due to the drying of the disease.
Research in December 2012 showed that manual washing can lead to the end of the skin known to burn hands or skin disease common conditions among medical staff.
Washing hands is always seen to be one of the symptoms of an infection or repeating something too much (OCD).
There are five important times per day when manual washing is essential to reduce the distribution of alcohol intake: after using toilets, go to need a small one, after clearing its need (to change his diapers), before giving them a meal and/after preparing a fresh meat, fish or a fast bird.
Other events where the correct manual washing technique should be made to prevent the supply of disease include before and after treating injury; after they have done, cough or tearing; after touching the animal’s dirt or handling them; after touching the desired divorce.
In many countries, there is a low manual washing rate for soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of the house were washing their hands with soap. The study of 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia had a higher rate of 97 percent; the United States nearly 77 percent; and China and a fewer approaches to change the behavior of hands in today's coordinated hours are one of the technique in developing countries to train children to wash their hands.
The "Basic Health Service" program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of a high-quality health and education of children.
To kill twice a year, added and washed daily hands with soap, brushing every day for the flute, is the foundation of this national project.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of the skin is enabled by adding the soap or severe spray to clean the water.
The most important act of soap and severe drugs is to reduce mix barriers, increasing concentration.
The only water does not have the ability to clean the skin because oil and protein, which is organic clay, is not easily melted into water.
Cleaning, however, is helped by a good flow of water..
Design mango, because of its reuse mode, it can keep bacteria obtained from pre-use.
A few studies that have dealt with the distribution of bacteria from contaminated mango soap have concluded that the distribution is not easy to occur because bacteria are removed from form.
The CDC station still states that the “grounded water soap in its supply is recommended”.
Stewards that kill bacteria have been widely declared in the public that is healthy.
By today, there is no evidence that using a proposed antiseptic or parasitic infection appoints a non-rejected into nature.
However, bacterial saucets contain common products that fight bacteria such as trilosan, which has a long list of non-conduct varieties.
So, even if the non-favorable types are not given for soap vs. bacteria, they may not work efficiently as they are declared.
In addition to skin protection, the combination can be acidic (synthetic acid, ascorbic acid) as a pH control, anti-benzoic acid and other skin lubricants (aloe vera, metha, drug from the trees). The extension of Oregon Public Health University reflects only as those responsible for anti-bacterial status in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands.
The hot water that is similar to washing hands is not enough to be bacterial.
Bacteria grow more rapidly in the body temperature (37°C).
However, hot water, cleaner is more effective than soapwater in removing natural oil that handles soil and bacteria.
In contrast to popular beliefs however, scientific studies have shown that using violent water there is no effect in reducing germs.
A block or a hand-type antisepticide is a non-water spray of hand sanitizer.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st year old, a water-based hand washable liquid (which is also known as alkoholic blocks, antiseptic or hand restrictions.) began to be popular.
Most of them have isopropyl or ethanol alcohol mixed with weighing ingredients such as carbomer ( acrylic acid polymer) and create oil, or moisture as make the glass, or foam to be used quickly and reduce the effect of alkoholic scars.
Increased hydrogen peroxide enhances the anti-crimination activity. 60 to 95% of alcohol-based hypertension should be in germs.
The containing alcohol-free bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, hepes, RSV, rhinovirus, variant and hepatitis.)
Allergies contain alcohol for 70% are 9.97% (combination of 3.5, equivalent to 30 bacterial spines) after using them with 99.99% to 99.999% (4-minute bacterial discounts on 10 minutes after using them.
All these are almost useless against the type of norovirus (or Norwalk), which is the most common causes of the cortroenteritis or alcoholism can be used properly to provide water-based hands or cover all the hands.
The front and back of all the hands and between and the ends of all fingers are suled by at least 30 to the liquid, foam or mats dry.
The tip fields must be properly installed as well, by touching them at all aspects. The U.S. Center for Control and Prevention recommends wash hands more than using cookies, especially when it is clear that the hands are dirty.
The increase in use of these liquids is derived from the convenience of its use and the activity of being germin quickly, however, should not be used as a bad manual washing method except soap and water is not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-positive organisms can lead to skin breach except emoline links and/or skin adhesive links have been added to the formula.
The effect of skin drying alcohol can be reduced or removed by adding the glassine and/or other electronic links to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-contained antibiotics caused a minimum of end to skin drying compared to other germs.
allergy problems facing skin touch, skin breakdown disease or alcohol-related disorder or ingredients that are contained in alcohol-based organisms have not occurred.
The lower capacity to cause skin burning turned into attraction compared to washing of hands with soap and water.
Despite its suitableness, non-water products do not clean the hands from germ devices, but tend to be germs.
It is due to this reason that manual impedance is not more suitable for soap and water in preventing the spread of germs because those germs are still remaining on the hands.
The efficiency of an alcoholism depends heavily on its organs and cells, and the historically they have not done well compared to those with alkohol.
Most recently, the combination that uses benzalkonium chloride is shown to have a strong and general activity against the germs after being used, compared to alkohol, which is shown to decrease in its efficiency over time, perhaps due to continuing to poor skin problems.
Many people from low income communities cannot afford soap prices and use ash or sand prices instead.
The ash or sand can be more suitable than water only but can not be effective than soap.
One concern is that if sand or ash has been germs, it can further escalate the disease rather than decreasing its spread.
Just like soap, ash is also a disinfectant product because it is mixed with water, it makes a mixture of alkaline.
WHO recommends gray or sand as soap products when the soap is not found.
The method of manual washing in an appropriate manner recommended by U.S. Preventing and Control Centers for spreading disease includes the following steps:
Use ghosts to wash their hands or flowing cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because static banks can be contaminated, although water temperature is not different.
Chronic hands using sufficient level of soap, including back parts of the hands, between fingers and even under claws.
The soap removes germs on the skin, and studies indicate that people have a tendency to wash their hands better than water alone.
Stainless steel for at least 20 seconds.
Chronicly causes friction, which helps to remove germs on the skin and chronically removes even more germs.
Sell well with flowing water.
Sale in the basin can poll the hands again.
Dry water using clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The hands that have water and moisture can easily be contaminated. The surface that is often forgotten is thumb, wrists, locations between fingers and under claws.
Artificial claws and soak claws keep them carry germs.
The lubricating oil is constantly recommended to support the hands from; the dry skin can cause damage to the skin that can lead to increased risk of transmission.
Low price options can be designed to enable hand washers of the canal and/or soaps are not available for example watering from a well-known syringe and/or using ash in countries where there is no sufficient water (such as water storage solutions), such as "carnation" and other low cost options.
Oxygen can be an easy technology used to be hung on a rope and a foot drive to pour some water into a hand and on a piece soap.
Reducing appropriate hands is an important part of the manual cleaning process, but the discussion continues on the most appropriate manual methods in the areas to wash the public.
The large-scale research that suggests that paper towels are more fresher than strips of steamers inside most bathrooms.
In 2008, research was carried out by Westminster University, London, and financed by the industry of European Shashi paper manufacturers, to compare the standardization of hygiene provided by paper towels, dry out air force and dry out the latest air type of jet-air.
After washing and drying the hands with mild air drying, the total number of bacteria was found to increase average on the fingers by 194% in the palm of 254%.
Drying hands for the jet-air store led to an average increase in the total number of bacteria in fingers by 42% and on plots for 15%.
After washing and drying the hands of the tissue, the total number of bacteria decreased by average fingers up to 76% and on the palm of the scientists also tested to determine if there was a possibility of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment due to all kinds of hand-drying technique.
The drying machine, providing the air of the unit for the speed required to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to spray the germs from the hand and the possibility of contaminating other bathroom users and setting up to 2 meters.
The use of air dryer power spreads germs up to 0.25 meters away from the machine.
In 2005, a research conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying techniques were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after the backing of the hands witnessed:
There are many manufacturer of water-drying products, and these hand-drying products are compared to tissue use.
Washing hands using the liquid tissue of disinfection is alternative when riding with no soap and water.
The hand disinfection liquid should have at least 60% of alcohol.
Wearing medical hands into a matter of long after a professional from Hungary, Ingaz Semmelweis discover its effectiveness (846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic equipment used to provide answers to hospital workers washing their hands.
One study has been reduced by infection rates due to its use.
Washing hands is recommended to be for 15 seconds medical, using sufficient amount of soap and water or gastrointestinal oil every part of the hands.
Hands should be touched together by binding fingers.
If there is dirt under claws, a soft brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can remain on the water in the hands, it is important to rinse off the hands for the clean towel.
After the washing, these tissues are used to close the water (and to open any external door if required).
This prevents the re-infecting of hands from those parts.
The purpose of hand wash in the health care area is to remove the disease (the "germs") and prevent them from spreading them.
The New England magazine reports that the lack of hands remains in most unacceptable levels in most clinical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting their hands before touching the patients and thus spreading them.
One study showed that the washing of hands properly and other simple processes can reduce the transmission level of blood flow associated with the catheter for 66. The World Health Organization published a table showing common ways of washing and handheld hands in the medical sector.
The draft corporate hand hygiene guide can also be found in an organization's website for public opinion.
The investigation was carried out by Whitby and other authors.
Commercial equipment can measure and confirm the safety of the hands, if the performance of the law is required.
The World Health Organization consists of a "Three times" to wash hands:
after that in the possibility of touching the blood/transparenting of the body
before a potential role to infect bacteria, and
After servicing the patient. Increased bacteria by soap (brasy “wrong drug” or “geron”) enables the product used to wash the hands to be able to kill bacteria.
Such an act of killing bacteria may be required before performing surgical or in a germs that are resistant to prevention and disinfection of bacteria is abundantly. In order to ‘surgical’, it is necessary to be able to be bound without handheld, chloroectic or spinal cord, washed with the other cleaned brush of cleaner’s cleaning device under the claws.
All the toys are suitable for release.
This process requires manual washing and hand-to-cooking, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long-lasting (10 minutes) is not required.
When you're selling, you must what is in the hand changers to be prevented from flowing back and back by hand.
After the washing of hands is complete, hands are touched to the polished garment and surgical gear worn.
To reduce the supply of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use the bacteria before and after the patient care.
With the control of the infection caused by bacteria in the hospital, it has been found that the most significant profit from washing hands occurred in the first 20% of the washing, and that poor profit was found when the hand washing rate was added more than 35%.
The only cause cause causes more than three-fold distribution of the disease-borne disease and bacteria to be caused by a bacterial bacterial physicist. Compared with the dilation of alcohol and bacterial infections.
But soap and water are more suitable than a combination of alcohol-based handheld hands by reducing the H1N1 A and Colstrium difficular pneumonia from the hands. The strategies of improving hand hygiene in healthcare landscapes may involve personnel regarding handwashing, increasing the concentration of alcohol-free, and applied museum and applied to workers.
There is a need for more research in which of these strategies are effective in different health care themes.
In developing countries, manual washing is recognized as a low cost device, which is important in having good health, and even a better diet.
However, the lack of reliable water, hand washable materials or soap in people’s homes, schools and workplaces are challenging to fulfill the global manual washing habits.
For example, many of our villages in Africa have washed their hands around every private or public toilets are few, even though cheap ways are there to build hand washing facilities.
However, low hand wash rates can also be a habit of adapting but not because of the absence of soap or water.
Growth and manual washing by soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of being delivered and lead to long-term behavior of people.
In order for this to work efficiently, monitoring and evaluation is important.
A survey of 70 surveys found that communities involved a handwashing technique in LMIC, while socially encouraging ways to change their behavior at a low level. One example of hand-washing growth in schools is the " UNICEF’s three-day approach" that encourages schools to take easy steps, with lower costs to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When low rates are met, schools can move from one star to the end three stars.
Creating handwashing stations can be a part of developing handwashing campaigns to reduce the disease and death of children.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of increasing awareness that is trying to make a climate change. Due to the main coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20, UNICEF improved to be used with the emoji's arms.
A small number of investigations has taken into account the highest cost of manual washing in developing countries with a DALY measurement.
However, one survey suggests that manual washing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation strategies.
The importance of manual washing on human health – especially for people in hazardous conditions such as mother whose delivery or deceased soldiers in hospitals – was first discovered in the 19th century with two hand hygiene predecessors: a doctor from Hungary in the name Ingaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Australia and Florence Nightingale, the British “the founder of modern nursing”.
At that moment many people still believed that infection was caused by a fatal smell known as the massas.
In 1980, the outbreak caused through food and health services carried out the U.S. Center to actively develop hand sanitation as an important method of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of cold colds in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of manual washing using soap to protect yourself from similar diseases.
For example, written banners "correct hand wash methods" were written next to the hand washing sinks in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing your hands from" is meant to declare to the person not wanting to take the responsibility of something or join others in a wrong or moral matter.
It comes from the passage of the Bible in Matthew where Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a major passage in some of the British communities.
In the Macbeth of Shakespeare, Daughter Macbeth begins to wash her hands with a coercion to try to clean up a thoughtful spot, marking the conscience of the crime she committed and persuade her husband to act.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or contemplating moral actions, appear more hands-on washing hands than others, and it seems worth more hand washable materials.
Moreover, those who are admitted to wash their hands after contemplating such things are less likely to engage in other acts of deficiency with “cleanse”, such as volunteering.
Religion enjoins the washing of hands on the basis of purity and as a sign. The washing of hands by using water without soap, it is part of the worship of washing hands in many religions, including the Bahá’í Faith, the Hinduism, the devilah and the netlat of the day in Judaism, Lavabos in Islam.
India, Judea and Islam orders to wash hands after using toilet.
And, India, Buddha Religion, the Deen of Sikh, Judaism and Islam enjoins the washing of hands before and every after eating food.
Risk control at work of COVID-19
COVID-19 risk control is the use of safety methods at work and risk control in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Precautions at work are based on the part of work and practiced, next assessing the risk of being affected, the extent of the disease in society, and the factors of the risk of employees who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (HOSA), work at a few risks are accompanied by people working rarely with the public and other workers, and basic measures to prevent infections are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging staff to stay at home if patients, respiratory punishment, and to maintain clean the procedure and clean up to the workplace theme.
The work of average exposure includes those that require constant attachment or close association with people who are unknown or suspected of COVID-19, but are unlikely to be infected with the ongoing dissemination of society or international transport.
This includes employees who generally interact with the general public such as schools, a working theme with a number of people, and a number of business referenced by many people.
The risk controls for this group, most of the basic measures to prevent transmission, include ventilation using a high-quality air filter, health restrictions, and to have self-defense facilities available if someone with COVID-19 is found.
The OSHA considers health and mortality facilities at risk or suspected of COVID-19 being at a high risk of at risk, which further increase if workers provide erosoli in, or collect and respond to referrals, known or suspects from a person with COVID-19.
These risks include engineering controls such as low- and environmental-level rooms, and self-equipped protection facilities.
COVID-19 outbreaks may have a lot of effects in the workplace.
Employees may not work due to being sick, need to take care of others, or for fear of being at risk.
Trading trends may change, in the type of product required, and the ways to access those products (such as buying products when there are many people or through traffic or services).
Lastly, the transmission of content from adversely affected areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted.
Planning deals with various levels of work and work performed, including factors to be at risk, the risk of being affected by household and community areas, and the risk of individual workers such as age or clinical situations.
They also list appropriate controls to deal with such risks, and emergency plans in a situation that may arise following the outbreak.
The preparations for infectious diseases and response plans can follow national recommendations or a particular area.
The goals of responsiveness include reducing distribution among employees, protecting people who are more vulnerable to chronic medical problems, maintaining business operations, and mitigating adverse effects to other organizations and involved in transporting goods.
The severity of the disease in a society where the business is affecting the response taken.
Risk control system is a very used system in the safety of the work and health set into dangerous groups based on efficiency.
A place where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be stopped, the most appropriate control is engineering, followed by administrative control, and the end self-protection devices.
Engineering controls involve separating employees from work-related risks without depending on the behavior of employees, and may be highly cost-effective solution to implement.
Administration control is a change in working policies or procedures that require action and employee or employer.
Self-protection (PPE) devices are considered as poor results than engineering and administration controls, but may prevent some instances of vulnerability.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk of the employee, and worn properly required (e.g., respiratory machinery), always and worn out, regularly checked, maintained, and modified, and properly removed, cleaned, and cast or prevent transmission.
According to the U.S. Security Administration and Health (OSHA), less vulnerable work is in line with people working with the public and other staff.
The primary measures of transmission are proposed for all working themes include constant washing and well, encouraging staff to remain at home if patients, a respiratory chastisement including covering a cough and sneezing, providing tissue and waste barrels, preparing for working from home or working in shifts that are required, to advise workers not using other equipment, and to maintain coordination and cleaning for work-based medicine.
Fast detection and segregation of people who are prone to infection is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the field of work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of chronic breathing illness should be at home until they do not have a basic temperature condition, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medication to reduce the condition or response to symptoms, and that workers at home are ill, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the work of being at risk of average includes those that require constant interaction with people or be close to people between six feet ( 1.8 meters) who are unknown or suspected of COVID-19, but may have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2 as a result of social distribution around the commercial area, or because the person has recently traveled to a greater supply of COVID-19.
This includes employees who interact with the general public such as in schools, the theme of work consists of a lot of people, and other aspects of business refer to the most people. The engineering controls for this and the most likely prevalence of transmission include placing high-quality air conditioners, increasing the barriers of air conditioners, and putting a window through through the driving for the customer service.
It is rare for employees in this dangerous group you need to use a machine to help breathe.
If a person becomes sick in a bird, well-protects the crew and other passengers include a separation of the patient and for a distance of 6 feet, choosing one of the patient’s staff or asking him to cover their mouth with their nose and tissues when he coughs or sneezing.
Flight staff should wear medical gloves that can provide us with patient passengers or places where they may have been exposed, and prefer more personal protection if a patient is very warm, he is coughing, or breathing difficulty.
Glavu and other tools cast after use should not be cast into custom hospitalized bags, and the exposed areas should be reduced and washed in future medicine. For shipping, including luxury ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include triping if you are sick, and separation and informing the health center at once if someone has a temperature or other symptoms when they are in the vessel.
For schools and child protection buildings, CDC recommends temporary closure or cleaning if an infected person has been in the school regardless of social distribution.
While there are limited distributions to social average, the methods of non-discrimination with people can be implemented such as the pursuit of education, meetings, and other large concentrations such as sports or training at restaurants, increasing space between desks, circumventing time of arrival and leaving, and using a different area of health office for children who have symptoms like cold cold fever.
While there are significant infections in society, by talking about the strategies of disagreement, the closest time of school can be considered. For workers who perform daily activities, the risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must contact qualified people or suspected of COVID-19 are recommended to follow those instructions like emergency medical technicians, as well as real protective equipment.
If there is a close contact at the time of taking, staff should clean up and clean up their work tape and equipment before reuse them or home cleaning reducer, and follow standard working procedures and PPE casting and washing clothes.
Osha takes other staff and dead room staff to be at higher risk or in a higher risk category to be infected.
Careers that have higher risks include the provision of health care, assistance, laboratory, medical transporters who have contacted or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These functions become highly exposed if employees perform procedures to produce aerosols, or collect or handle samples from known patients or suspected of COVID-19.
The processes for generating aerosols include inserting the tube into the unim, bronchoscope, some procedures and dental diagnostics, or a collection of samples for the detection,
The high risk of mortalization is involved in preparing bodies of known individuals or suspects by the COVID-19 facilities at their disposal; these are high risk transmission functions if they carry out the investigations of these hazardous groups. Additional risk-related facilities for COVID-19 patients, including when producing aerosols are practiced.
Special air transmission of a healthy air can be suitable in some health care settings and dead storage rooms.
Samples should be addressed with a safety-bio-level alert of 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that patients who enter exceptional waits for COVID-19 in respect of other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory machines for those working around 6 feet known as SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform procedures to produce aerosols.
In the United States, the N95 respiratory machines approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a fully written respiratory system that includes adequate testing, training, and medical diagnosis.
Other types of respiratory machinery can provide the highest immunity and improve employee comfort. WHO recommends a ovarol, since COVID-19 is a respiratory system and is infected with physical fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for an examination worker in the entry area.
For those who gather respiratory samples from taking care of them, or transporting COVID-19 patients without procedures to produce aerosilis, WHO recommends a surgical mask, sunglasses, and gloves.
If the procedure for producing aerosols is carried out, the surgical mask is replaced by the N95 respiratory machine or FFP2.
Since the global acquisition of the PE is not enough, WHO suggests reducing the needs of the PE via the e-mail of medical information, physical barriers such as bright windows, allowing those involved only in direct access to the COVID-19 patient’s room, using the PEPE key function, to continue using the machine to help eliminate it while serving a number of patients with the same diagnosis, and not encouraging the use of mask for people with symptoms.

STATISTICS: [Covid-19] Reduce the load and prepare the future
Date/SALURE: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LESENI: CC0: There is no right stored
We find ourselves in unique situations this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that makes it clear our close human relationships around the world and our own responsibility.
We don’t have the first place for its challenges, but we don’t know that our best answers depend on the type of feelings in the world, cooperation, and community creation that is the heart of this organization.
Faith and friendship with each of our partners via email, phone, and chat is a unique feeding of good men who have been fortunate to work with them.
I am grateful and very proud to depend on you as all of me.
Last week, there is a person who shares his gratitude for our work.
He reminded me of the importance of the world to use Wikipedia right now, and the main mark is for this important resource to stay online and accessible to all people.
Your work makes this possible, whether it is doing stations to continue working or our fellow paid or community to be safe.
The world needs information that Wikipedia offers, this time than ever.
This is the time that is not only what we do, but how we do, it will produce a meaningful result in the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your work, we will be doing some important adjustments about how we work together, from this next week.
Amendment to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team c met last night to discuss our way and schedule the day and the next months.
In the conversation, we considered what we thought would be the right answer to what we do and the best way to develop an organization at this time.
Strangely we all wanted to relieve stress and support our long-term mission.
If you want to call us, that's the same.
For employees, Contractors, and all contract workers:
Our daily working prospects will be around 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to an unknown time.
We do not promote holidays - if you can work for more hours, our mission can use you.
However, this world cannot be forecasted at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, get vegetables, or go to a doctor, your interests are our priority.
We do not track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should be clear, but we say.
No patient days or PTO required – just tell your manager and help your team through the calendar and schedule to ensure the main areas of work have been addressed.
(If you are found to have COVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops to know so that T&C can help you with support and make sure your situation can be considered well with the management).
Employees working for hours will be paid all money.
We have already said, and we are devoted to respect our commitments to our contractors and our staff working for hours.
Everyone will be rewarded on the basis of his regular hours they have worked during regular conditions.
This includes if you’re sick and you can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people operate as a way to address their stress to our world.
What we do can be very satisfactory, especially this time.
Again, this refers to self-care.
What we ask is that we contact our manager, so that we know what we should expect and we can fix it.
Other jobs are considered essential.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
SRE Teams, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (between other teams) perform important tasks that may require additional support.
We will start all the processes and departments so we evaluate the current objectives and we can focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are many things to do for us all, we will all focus on the most important projects.
Reduced speed now will not harm later.
We do not plan to "more time to cover" soon this pandemic over.
You will not be expected to work for an additional hour to achieve a deal that is currently impossible.
We agree that situations have changed, and we will work to keep new goals and time possible.
What happens with the APP ( annual Planning)?
To adjust our new truth and prospects for working hours every day, we aim to adjust the duration of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan presentation.
Our goal is to suggest the increasing duration of our 2019-2020 program which allows more time to plan budget to allow our employees to prioritize essential tasks, take care of themselves, and be dealt with their loved ones while they need or want to work for the next few weeks.
The increase in this time reduces the current work of planning and pressure throughout the organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and we will inform the members and teams about the following steps as soon as possible as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office status, transmission, and cleaning
Last week, we knew that one of the colleagues in SF might have been infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we hired well-wishers to clean up all areas at the San Francisco office.
They used the hospital killing solution to clean up everywhere, even in the halls and stairs that reach our floor.
This building uses its own product handling role protocol that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel well that the office will be prepared well at the time we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in DC.
Until last week, our DC office transferred its work to be carried out in accordance with the orders shared by San Francisco.
According to the understanding of some of our colleagues in NYC, we’ve also been discussing about hosting a Brooklyn region.
This discussion continues but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who worked remotely know that it can be a difficult situation to adapt, and wanted to give such advice:
Limit the length of the meetings with an increase of one or two hours.
If long sessions are needed, consider how they can be combined over a period of days.
Define the assembly clearly, have the agenda, and send the advance reading material.
Make video default, and tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate integration and direct connection.
To have a leader to facilitate each meeting, someone to track chats with questions and monitor the list of the speakers, and someone to help write the quotations (or engage in writing a quote).
Send an email to technical support if you need a good scalp device.
Use your welfare compensation to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties center in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Team focuses on the network environment’s guidance to help in the increase of distributed tasks in the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel all federal and Wikimedia events, as well as editthons, until the WHO announced this pandemic ended.
We informed them that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make them hard to complete their accepted grant activities and that no one will be punished for delaying or fixing those goals.
This next week we will track additional instructions on Wikimania and other regional conferences and the topic community.
The general opinion from the world’s societies looks sad at the inconvenience but the comfort of transparency and the ability to target their own communities, Wikimedias and otherwise.
Continuously, the CRT covers the page on Meta-Wiki to provide spaces to the community to track the results and track our contacts.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will be sending an invitation to your next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/0700 PT to a specified staff meeting.
We will take this time to share additional donations, answer your questions and take time to connect yourself.
We are with us here to help in any way we can.
At present, you can continue searching for information from this email, and all other important information associated with COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
CRT will update these pages and all the details in the shared place.
We also deal with maintaining constant communication with the workers living countries that have been affected at the moment.
If you have any questions about transportation, events, great tasks, or any other challenge you may need help, please do not hesitate to notify and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide the required support and cooperation.
If you have a privacy issue or sensitive, please send an email to Bryanm Judn - the Director of the International Association of HR.
No one of these changes should be seen as a drop-off for your tasks and tasks.
Instead, it is aware that at this time, our work and responsibilities are more likely to change in a way we have not seen before.
These are the steps we believe are crucial in supporting so that we can continue to work, provide our required movement, and the world’s services they can rely on.
Our scheduled work will be there waiting for us when the time will come.
At present, it is time to help and create a space for important tasks that will be coming in the next week and months.
We need all of you to enable it, and so we need all of you to protect yourselves with our families so that you may be in good condition when you need it to emerge.
For now, please -- have your hands and do not touch your face!

The 2 squeegee for turning b'Angiotensin (ACE2) is an shattered enclosed in the outer part (cellular network) of cells in the lungs, nerves, kidneys and gastrointestines.
ACE2 responds to activities related to antigensin (ACE) by reducing the levels of antigens-II and increasing the Ang (1-7) by making it a good cure for heart disease. AC2 is also used as part of entry into the cell of some coronavirus.
A person's exaggeration is repeatedly referred to as haCE2.
The 2 antigens of angiotensin are inhibitors of metals that are in the area of last cells and other cells.
ACE2 Protein has M2 peptide compound N and the transport domain of amino acids inchlene C
ACE2 is a one-way I membrane protein, its digestive domain in the upper part of the cell in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 double-sided agile domain has been holding another membrane-oriented domain as sheddase, and the generated protein is provided in the blood system and finally delivered through urine.
ACE2 is available in many links: AC2 is attached to alveola cells type II of lungs, small digestive enterosatis, vena vessels and soft muscle nerve cells in many limbs.
The ACE2 mRNA display is also available in the brain membrane, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain system.
The main task of ACE2 is to work as an ACE Standard.
ACE consumes the hormone I of angiotensin in angiotensin II of blood pressure.
Its ACE2 represents a carboxyl-terminal amino acid phelylanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and breaking into a vasodilator race (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Ile-His-O).
ACE2 can also be completed several links including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the transport network of SCL6A19 of natural amino acids and is referred to as Hartnup disease.
As a membrane transmitting proteins, ACE2 serves as the main part of the entry of certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the S SARS-CoV protein co-operation and SARS-CoV2 for the ACE2 division on the cell part causes the endoccytosis and transfer of viruses and are shattered for internal cells.
This entry process also requires protein preparation S and prevents the main serine proteins of TMPRSS2, which are currently investigated as possible treatments. This led to further assume that reducing ACE2 levels, in cells, can help cope with infection.
However, many professional and management organizations have proposed to continue the classic AC and ARB barrier.
The review of the framework and analysis of the meta published on 11 July, 2013, found that "ACE barriers were associated with a total of 34% of the ammonia risk compared to the controls."
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced to patients treated with ACE restrictions that were high risk of getting pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure to work.
The use of ACE barriers was also included in the decrease of deaths related to memonia, although the results were weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia."
ACE2 Connected human (RHACE2) has been treated as a new treatment for severe lung injuries, and it seemed to improve the blood circulation of the body and oxygen in the smaller pigs with severe respiratory syndrome.
Half life of the RACE2 for humans is 10 hours and will start working after 30 minutes plus a result factor (time) 24 hours.
Several results show that rhACE2 can be a good remedy for those who cannot tolerate the renin-angiotensin system barriers (RAS barriers) or in diseases where angiotensin II around ilove.
The COVID-19 app is a mobile application designed to help find people who interact to address coronavirus disease 2019-20, i.e. the process of identifying people ("people who met them") who can be accompanied by an infected person.
Many programs were developed or proposed, with official support of the government in several districts and regions.
Several systems for creating expert search programs are designed.
Privacy issues are implied, especially about systems that depend on the geographic location of the users of the app.
The irresistible alternative includes the use of Bluetooth signals to keep the nearest user’s location for other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will together integrate functionality to accept those programs based on Bluetooth directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has provided programs that allow citizens to check if they are in contact with people who have COVID-19.
Used more than 200 cities of China. In Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is used.
The program was developed by the local IY, released as a open source and will be handed over to the government. The Northern Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a highly reliable Bluetooth search program for infected people that could quickly respond to health care authorities.
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, the app was pending on Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the app was a search for the people who looked for was at the highest stages of development, and it was used after a few weeks. The program is organized in Ireland, and in France (“StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand focus on software based on the BlueTrace Converter and protocol. Russia is looking forward to establishing a program based on the location of patients available to COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to be ensured that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a safety engineering professor at Cambridge University University, listed several functional problems for software systems, including good false views and potentially effective if software use is restricted to a limited number of people.
Dealing with the problems regarding the distribution of “viral” or malicious software, Apple puts the barriers to what type of organizations that can keep software related to its coronavirus in its Program Store, blocking it to those who are “official” or other prominent organizations.
Google and Amazon have used those restrictions as well.
Employees’ privacy campaign showed the victims of high population diagnostics using coronavirus software, especially if diagnostic infrastructure is designed to address coronavirus disease will be forwarded after a controlled disease.
Amnesty International and other than 100 organizations have reportedly stated that restrictions be held in the investigations of this type
The organizations announced four conditions in government projects:
must be a "legal, useful, and appropriate";
must develop surveillance and diagnostic criteria for time;
The use of data should be restricted for the purpose of COVID-19.
The security of data and unknown is protected and displayed as protected according to evidence;
must study digital avoid multiplying discrimination and exclusion;
must share all data with other characters defined by law;
must be protected from abuse and the right of citizens to address abuse;
The “all key stakeholders” will be required, including by public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Compute Club of Germany (CC) and authors without restrictions (RSF) also issued a audit list.
The Google/Apple program aims to address the ongoing diagnostic problem by eliminating the deletion mechanism from the operating system of their device after it is no longer required.
Some countries used network-based monitoring instead of the software, excluding the need for software download and capabilities and avoiding searching.
In Israel, web-based monitoring was accepted.
A web-based solution that has access to local data has potentially significant privacy problems.
However, not all of the central servers need to have access to personal data; several private handling systems are designed that only use servers for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed system was used to carry out the searches of the people who looked for.
Instead of using one app, the system collected search information from a variety of sources including mobile device search data and card transaction data, and includes this notification via text messages for people who may have been infected.
In addition to using this information to notify possible people, the government has also made the location information accessible to the public, something allowed because of the privacy law of information after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through several apps and websites. Several countries including Germany focusing on using major and private storage systems.
By 6 April 2020, the information is not provided.
The look for people whose privacy is well established, and a large group that was established in 2013 until 7 April 2020, most of the professional groups were handling private solutions that are easy to use, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to keep a close area of user to other phones.

The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed clinical trials, there are several ongoing trials to create the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect an urgent need to prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, found over 18 months.
The five selected vaccines were in the study of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread throughout the world in 2020, causing significant investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use genome to be propagated to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
As mentioned in April, the requirements of the CEPI program for the development of vaccination are high speed, manufacturing capacity, standard consumption, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were researched and development at the beginning of 2020 to create appropriate COVID-19 vaccine.
The main objectives of the platform developed in the safety research of Phase Including:
The essence of the particles (DNA and RNA) (I-phase I and a vaccine designated: Moderna, mRNA-273)
virus detecting viruses (I-formed controller and selected chargers: CanSino Biologics, type vector operator viruses 5).
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 selected vaccines are conducted in the early stages, with 78 certified as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but for a few public information (required or constituted).
The I-II Phase Test runs an initial security test and communist, typically does not follow a specific procedure, is controlled through the placeholders and in various areas, while acknowledging the most accurate and effective dose.
The III phase tests typically involve more participants, including a control group, and measure the effectiveness of the disease prevention vaccine, while monitoring the negative impact on the measure at all.
Out of the 79 mentioned vaccinations (tested at the beginning of April), 79 vaccines were not evaluated by man (not yet in the study "pre-clinic testing").
In January 24, 2020 in Australia, the Queensland University announced that it conducts an investigation into a possible vaccine to reverse genetic protein that can stimulate the body’s immunity.

The vaccine-based exam for the laboratory study, and the human testing plan is scheduled in July or August 2020.
Earlier in the week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump gave the CureVac, the “great amount for exclusive access to Covid-19”, which the German government challenged.
On March 17, 2020, the U.S. pharmacist company Pfizer announced the partnership with the BioNTech German company to jointly create a vaccine that relies on mRNA.
Based on mRNA, BN162, is currently measured in animals and therefore clinical tests are expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, the Taxi Biotech company announced that they will have a result measurements for animals in April 2020 and the final coverage chosen can begin to undergo tests during the autumn of the leaves.
In France on March 19, 2020, the COVID-19 vaccine innovation launched a $1.9 million vaccine research partnership comprising the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of COVID-19 vaccine development to 29 million.
Some CEPI investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Modema, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing with six selected vaccines.
The Imperial College researchers in London announced on 20 March 2020 that they grow the most powerful RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was prepared within 14 days of receiving the procedure from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government declared $ 275 million to finance 69 medical research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccines appointed in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medico programs and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian government declared only 192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine plan, with a plan to introduce a "national new vaccine bank that can be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, Pittsburgh College of Medicine researchers reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in the mouse, stating that “MNA issued a microscope of SARS-CoV-2 S1 influenced the special antigen [inside] which appeared from 2 weeks after vaccination.”
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Waterloo School University Drug Study announced a structured vaccine-based structure based on DNA as a spontaneous spray spray spray.
Using bacteria, DNA will be manufactured from copies within the human bacteria to extract particles like malware, which can trigger the immune system to protect the body against SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industry, and three U.S. universities provided resources to access computers from IBM, as well as resources to providing computer services from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as non-special effects.
That means they can be more beneficial than the disease that prevents.
The most routine-free trial in Australia seeks to hire 4,170 staff of health care.
It is possible that the growing vaccines are not safe or will not produce expected results.
Early research to assess vaccine efficiency by using specific animal covid-19 systems, such as ACE2 containing genes from the mouse, other laboratory animals, and other non-human particles, shows the need for a 3-level diagnosis of infectious safety measures, and international coordination to ensure safety standardized procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MARS are tested in non-human animals models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccination to protect against SARS that have been shown to be safe and bringing the expected result to humans.
According to the research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the diagnosis and growth of new vaccines and medicine to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world. There is also no vaccine confirmed against the MERS.
When MARS started spreading, it was believed that an existing SARS research can provide an important tool to develop vaccines and treatment against the MERS-CoV infection.
Until March 2020, there was a single vaccine for MERS (based DNA) completed clinical I for humans, and the three continue to, all of which is a vaccine to prevent viruses, virus DNA (Chadox1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-MERS).
Social media posts have developed a procedural theory that the virus causes COVID-19 was known and that coverage was already available.
The copyrights referred to as far as social media outlets refer to existing copyrights of the electronic series and vaccines to other coronavirus varieties such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory disease (SAR-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Some symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat wounds, loss of feeling smell, and stomach pain.
Starting the time of exposure and symptoms is usually about five days but may start on the second or fourteen days.
When a large number of cases cause mild symptoms, some develops that the melonization of viruses or various organs to work.
By the 17th of April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in countries and the 21st empire, resulting in more than 15,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people are being recovered. The virus is mainly distributed among people who are close to each other, often through small drops offered when they cough, sneezing, or talking.
Although these drops are produced when deciding outside, they fall into the floor or into areas than getting infected at a long distance.
People can also be infected by touching the infected area and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in areas up to 72 hours.
It is most common in the first three days after symptoms have seen, though its appearance is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of illness.
People who suspect their virus and caregivers are recommended to use masks.
Public recommendations generally wear masks vary, while some authorities recommend their use, some recommend using them and others if they want people to use them.
At present, there is no vaccine or special treatment for COVID-19 prevention.
The internal infection of the disease has been reported in many countries for all six parts of WHO.
Those infected with the virus may be wrong regarding symptoms or show symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include respiratory disorder, ongoing pain or pressure on the chest, frustration, walking disorders, and blue-colored surface; they are advised to seek treatment if these symptoms are present.
Unusual; the symptoms in the upper part of breathing such as sneezing, as a nose or throat pain can be seen.
Symptoms in stomachs such as fuel, vomiting, diarrhea appear in different percentages.
Other cocktails in China showed a chest stress and heart-only vomiting.
In some cases, the disease can continue to be an ammonia, various organs not work with death.
This is known as a crossover period.
The erupt period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but it can start the second or fourteen.
97.5 percent of people who show symptoms will show within 11.5 days after exposure. The report shows that not all infected will show symptoms.
The role of these speakers who do not show symptoms in the infection is still unknown, however, the preliminary evidence indicates that they can contribute to the dissemination of the disease.
The ratio of infected people who do not presently show symptoms and are researched, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports 20 percent of all people who have continued to show symptoms while in hospital.
The China Health Commission began to include people who do not show symptoms on their daily visa on April 1; 166 people infected that day, 130 people (78%) did not show symptoms when they were tested.
Exploit and mates may have high levels of viruses,
Chat aloud refers to multiple drops than usual speaking.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing anonymously can cause drops to up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although they are not normally distributed in the air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that it is possible to infect through air particles and air gathers that are outside of people's rooms had a positive sample of RNA virus.
Some medical procedures such as entering repent and reviving the heart and lungs (CPR) may cause the water of asthma to be transformed into air and thereby cause the propagation through the air.
While there is an inadequate that the risk is believed to be low. The virus can be infected when people show symptoms; although the infections are possible before symptoms are low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECD) says although it is not clear how the disease spreads, one person generally reacts to two or three others.
In particular, the virus was found to be detected in one day on the card, up to three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and the stainless steel (ISI 304), and up to four hours on the 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature.
The soap and cleaning medication are also effective if used well; soap products undermine the virus’s protective layer, it has forced its power, as well as provide it with skin and other areas.
In other cases, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical chemical), they do not work properly. In the study, the salivaries were taken on average of two days after they began hospitalization.
Among six patients, the first sample showed the highest level of the virus and the sixth patient showed the highest level of the virus on the second day of testing.
Strong respiratory disease, coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus to severe respiratory disorders,
All components of new SARS-CoV-2 virus-related viruses in nature.
The outside of the human body, the virus is occupied with the use of the home, which surgerys its protective distortion. SARS-CoV-2 is widely related to the SARS-CoV of nature.
The lungs are the most affected ingredients by COVID-19 because the virus reaches the cells that carry the virus through antigensin-racist (ACE2), which are widely found in the II lungs.
The virus uses specific glycoprotein of known areas as "spike" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter the local cell.
The severe injury of the heart was found in 12% of people infected with hospitalization in Wuhan, China, and is widely happening in severe illness.
The symptoms of cardiovascular disease are high, because of anti-inflammatory disease and immune system during the development of the disease, but severe heart wall injuries may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are widely seen in their heart and are responsible for the performance of the heart.
Most cases of in the heart (31%) and blood have been transmitted to ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poor predictive factors. The diagnosis of people who have died due to COVID-19 has obtained specific changes due to the disease (DD), and lymph-contained cells in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV 2 has an ACE-2 growth that mirrors your body’s surfaces in the respiratory system, severe patients with COVID-19 have the symptoms of the hypainflammation system.
In particular, the GM-CSF cell produced IL-6 of inflammation and the causes of the severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Several skin disease has also been reported during blood survey.
WHO has published a number of survey protocols for the disease.
The most common technique of testing is in the research lab to explore the availability of genes (RT-PCR).
The survey is usually carried out on the samples of breath obtained by the testing of the stainless clinic; however; the cough sample and mate can also be used.
Results are generally available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples that were taken aside and the result is worth less quickly.
Chinese scientists were able to focus on the coronavirus crisis and the genetic series so that the world can develop specific DNA samples to detect the transmission of the virus.
From April 2020, clinical tests (which can detect active infections and if someone was previously infected) were progressing but not being widely used.
The Chinese experience of testing has shown the accuracy is 60 to 70 percent only.
The FDA in the United States approved the first attempt to take care of 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month.
Double-line glass and many parts of the angle used to examine the pum cords,
The presence of Subpleural in bulk, wrong way (the thickness related to the loular and different pairs of alveolas), and the connection can be seen as much as possible.
Few data are available regarding small lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pulmonary examination are:
Optical observation: pluury, pericarditis, lung filled with liquid instead of air and water accumulation in tissues and lung air spaces.
Four kinds of harshness of viral pneumonia can be investigated:
Non-sufficient pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumoyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumoytes, interstial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and structure of large cells.
Chronic pneumonia: a specific change in lungs due to nephrotic syndrome (DAD) with liquid from lungs.
DAD is caused by acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoemia.
healable Nimonia: liquid delivery in the gums and pulmonary interstital fibrosis.
Blood: The major problems that blood clotting controls become more active (DIC);
Reduced protective measures include staying at home, avoiding many areas, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing having a good cough and avoiding eye strain, nose or mouth and unwashed hand.
CDC proposes to cover the mouth and nose using tissues when coughing or sneezing and recommends to use within the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper manual cleaning after a cough or snuffing.
CDC has suggested to use fabric blackouts in a public environment, to prevent infection from a person who reflects symptoms. The strategies for separating the community intend to reduce compatibility with people infected in large groups by closing school and where to operate; preventing transport and baning large public conventions.
Individual stays guidelines also include people stay away from at least 6 feet (5.8 meters).
There is no known drug working to prevent COVID-19. Although no vaccine is expected until 2021 as early as possible, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the intensity of the outbreak, known as "repair reduction"
CDC also suggests that people wash hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the dirt is seen on the hands, before eating and after making a fast, coughing or sneezing.
It is more recommends to use hands with at least 60% of disinfectants, but it is time for soap and water to be absent. In areas where contaminated disinfectants are not readily available, WHO provides domestic production formula.
In these structures, antimicrobial activity is based on ethanol or isopropanoli.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial bacterial hurricanes within the summit; not "the object used for handbooks"
Gliserol is added as a substance used to keep things moisture.
People are regulated for handling, which can include liquid use as treatment, oxygen support, and treat other affected ingredients.
CDC suggests that those suspects that they have this unusual mask.
Outdoor breathing device (ECMO) is used to address respiratory disorders, but its advantages are still checked.
Physical cleanliness and have a healthy life and a balanced diet has been recommended to improve immunity.
The treatment can be applied to those who have demonstrated severe symptoms at the beginning of these infections. WHO and the China Health Commission has published recommendations to care for the hospital because of COVID-19.
Medical doctors and lung doctors in the United States have included treatment recommendations from various organizations to free resources, the IBC.
Up to April 2020, there is no special COVID-19 treatment.
In addition, some professionals proposed a paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen to be the first choice to use.
They must be considered to reduce the virus infection, especially in the health care environment when performing procedures that can provide erosoli, such as putting a cell or transmit air to the patient using hands.
For health care professionals who treat people with COVID-19, CDC recommends to place someone in the Air Decentralization Room (AIIR) as well as apply common precautions, people’s effects of contact with air infection. CDC provides guidance on how to use the Protective Materials (PPE) during a major pandemic.
The recommended clothing is: PPE gear, diameter or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, the priorities (other than mask) are recommended.
N95 tests have been approved for industrial environment but FDA has approved masks to be used under the Protection of Emergency Use (EUA).
They are designed to protect against eruption cells in the air such as dust but its effectiveness against specific biological cells is not guaranteed for undefined use.
When the masks are not available, CDC recommends using surface restrictions, or as the last option, the masks made at home.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not very strict that require ventilation or renewables, but is required for a large percentage of events.
Support type for people with respiratory problems associated with COVID-19 is researched by people in the hospital, and certain evidence that placing cells can be avoided by air inserting device at a high level.
It is unknown if one of these two causes equal profit to people who are very sick.
Some doctors prefer to use ventilation installations because this technique reduces the particles of moisture compared to the air insert device at a higher level. Several cases are common to the elderly (more than 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developing countries lack adequate access to everyone’s beds, which reduces the health system’s ability to handle sudden COVID-19 events which are very severe in need of hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% were hospitalised in the most vulnerable population units, 2.3% needed to help breathing and 1.4 percent died.
In China, about 30 percent of people hospitalized because of COVID-19, were eventually admitted to a critical room.
It becomes more difficult to use air inserting plants to become a severe respiratory disease (ARDS) happens with COVID-19 and it is becoming more difficult to increase oxygen.
Air-controlled air-conditioned instruments and high-speed PEEP are needed to increase oxygen delivery and still reduce the risk of lung injury associated with air-conditioning transmission tool
High PEEP can be not available on old air inserters.
The study of possible treatments began in January 2010, and several antiviral drugs are conducted clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to bring good results.
While new drugs can be conveyed in 2021 to develop, a number of medicines already have been approved for further use or are tested.
The anti-viral medication can be used by people with severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in potentially efficient and safe medical trials. The FDA has given a temporary consent to distribute antibodies as a trial treatment in cases where such a person’s life has been severely threatened or immediately.
It has not undergone clinical research required to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app and handled the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to name their ID number.
The software can discover the "man who you've got closer" by sending the diagnostic data and thus be able to detect possible risks and infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the possible risk is found, the app is not only recommended to separate, but also informs local health officials. A large mobile data analysis, mobile phone monitoring, and machine insights are used to track infected people and who interact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the government of Israel facilitated security protocols for monitoring mobile data of people who are believed to have coronavirus.
The action was taken to ensure that those who are struggling and protecting who can be accompanied by infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared mobile data with German federal, Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the virus from spreading.
Russia spreads the facial recognition technology to detect quarantine law.
Giulio Gallera, the health commissioner of the Italian region, said he was notified by mobile phone providers to "40 percent of people continue to walk only".
The German government operated a computer programming experience with over 42.000 participants.
Also, the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulad, called for innovative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People can find stress in quarantine, travel restrictions, medical harm or the fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connoe saying, "The increase in separation with the people, loneliness, healthlessness, stress and deterioration is an ideal approach to harm the mental health and well-being of the people."
The disease may have a few symptoms or not to have any symptoms, similar to another common respiratory disease such as a cold.
An abnormal illness usually occurs within two weeks, where people with severe or critical conditions can take three or six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women can be at high risk of infection by COVID-19 depending on the data compared to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MerS, but the data of COVID-19 is missing. For other people, COVID-19 can affect lungs and cause pneumonia.
For people highly affected, COVID-19 may rise quickly to become a chronic respiratory disease (ARDS) that causes acute injury, germinative infections or various illusions to work.
Problems related to COVID-19 include bacterial disease, blood clotting, heart damage, kidneys and liver.
Blood clotting is abnormal, especially the increase in term of prothrombin, is described in 6% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19, where abnormal functioning of the kidneys is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30 percent of people with COVID-19 show a lot of initi (high levels of liver harm)
According to the report, the average time between symptoms was ten days, and five days used hospitalization.
However, patients who were transferred to a critical condition had an average of seven days between hospitalization and dying.
In the early stages, the average duration of showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full rate of six to 41 days.
In the investigation conducted by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a level of 2.6 percent where women were at a level of death of 1.7 percent.
Post-dead sample historian tests show some changes in the lung format and severe respiratory disease in all lungs.
The major changes between cells also appear in the gum cells.
An image of lungs is similar to a severe respiratory disease (ARDS).
In 11.8 per cent of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, the destruction of the heart seemed to have increased levels of the protein or a heart shock.
According to the data of March from the United States, 89 percent of those hospitalized were pre-existing. Access to medical and economic resources can also affect the state of death.
Estimates of deaths from this situation vary because of those regional differences, but also because of the problems of a specific approach.
The minimum number of non-verbal cases may result in an estimated amount of death.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previous infected people may mean that the current death rate is ignored.
Smoking was more likely to have symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times in need of special treatment or to be compared to non-smorrhage people. Questions have been issued on the time that the disease will be.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found that there were about 20 to 30 percent in the lung capacity of the disease, lung tests showed some damage to the disease.
This may also lead to health problems that remain after severe disease recovers.
By March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection provided a suitable and long-term protection in the disease.
Prevention is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronavirus cases, but there are reports of cases where people are exposed to COVID-19 and are accompanied by positive coronavirus tests in the future.
These events are believed to increase in long-term infections rather than new infections.
The virus is considered natural and is from animals, through the spread of infections.
His source is unknown but by December 2019, the prevalence spreads from one person to the other.
The first 41th COVID-19 survey published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed the first date that the symptoms started is 1 December 2019.
Official posts from WHO reported that the first signs appear were on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to measure the death rate.
These numbers vary depending on the region and duration and are affected by the number of dimensions, the quality of the health system, the choice of treatment, from the first time received by the demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO handed the ICD-10 emergency codes which are U07.1 for deaths resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 infection by COVID-19 tested clinical or epidemiologically without infection by the SARS-CoV-2 reported in the news, according to cases the number of deaths divided by the number of cases within a certain period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240.191) to 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary according to the region. Other measures include the amount of death (CFR), which shows the percentage of the detected people who die because of the disease, and the extent of the death of infected people (IFR), which shows the percentage of infected people (known and undetected) who die because of the disease.
This data is not blocked and follows a certain number of people from infection to the state’s solution.
Even though not all infected people have access to antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people who have been infected.
At an explosion hub in Italy, the Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 people, 80 percent (1.7) already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread in the Kanivali ceremony, causing too many deaths, and not all deaths of COVID-19 can be formally listed in that way.
Additionally, the German health system has not failed.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent may contain antibodies, as evaluated from people who provide blood.
69 (0.04% of the population) are confirmed to be dead because of COVID-19.
The impact of these diseases and its death rate is different for both men and women.
In a study conducted in China and Italy, the death rate is high for men.
The biggest risk is for 50 years old and older men, and the gap between men and women close to only 90 years of age.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent per men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this gender diversity is unknown, but the elements of nature and behavior can be a factor.
Environmental factors related to gender, women’s level smoking is more than one disease such as blood pressure than women can be contributing to high death for men.
In Europe, 57 percent of infected people were 72 percent dead because of COVID-19 were males.
From April 2020, the U.S. government does not track data related to the COVID-19 response gender.
Research has shown that virus disease such as Ebola, HIV, flu epidemics and SARS affects different men and women.
A large percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that CO represents coronavirus, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 is the first year that was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was selected to avoid the specific geographic location (e.g. China), the types of animals or groups, according to international recommendations on providing the name for the prevention of stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called a respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the virus of COVID-19" and "the virus that causes COVID-19" in public communication.
Illness and virus are commonly known as "viral virus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly known as "viral coronavirus" and " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended that the deadly disease in 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov as temporary names and the disease as opposed to using areas like disease and virus names,
Official COVID-19 names and SARS-CoV-12 were released on 11th February 2020.
Due to the limitations of the ability in the series of standard supply, some digital manufacturers print healthcare equipment such as stainless cleaning and air replacement parts.
In one example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed an induction line, and the seller could not submit for a reasonable period of time, the local seller developed and published 100 cells needed for one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, false theories, false information and the absence of information emerged related to the strain, rate, prevention, treatment and other disease resources and spread quickly online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit viruses to other animals.
Research failed to gain evidence of the virus to restore themselves to the pig, duck, and chicken.
No medicine or vaccine confirmed to treat the disease.
A global study of COVID-19 vaccinations is developed by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the “One World Health Organization” to assess the impact of the four anti-viral medication with a large commitment to efficiency.
There is no vaccine available, but many organizations grow vaccines away.
The initial functions of SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 all use the AC2 receiver to log into human cells.
There are three immunization strategies that are investigated.
First, researchers intend to create a whole virus vaccine.
Use of such virus, whether they do not work or are dead, intend to increase human immune results for new COVID-19 infections.
The second approach, the vaccine component, intends to create vaccines that make the immune system feel certain parts of the virus.
In the event of SARS-CoV-2, such research takes into account the S-spike protein that helps the virus insert the ACE2 −
The third method is of a cell cell vaccination ( DNA vaccines or RNA, a new method of conducting vaccine).
experimental vaccinations due to any methods must be tested for safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of vaccination started with 4 volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an incurable genetic code copied from the disease. The pending improvement is recommended as a possible challenge of SARS-COV-2 vaccination development, but has complexity.
There are more than 300 clinical trials which are active from April 2020.
The seven experiments were assessing the already proven treatment of malaria, including four surveys of hydroxychloquine or chloroquine.
The anti-viral medication includes a lot of study of China, and the trials of the III phase in several countries due to reports before the end of April.
According to the COVID-19 clinical development, from April 2020. Several antivir drugs are evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir and lopinavir/ritovir as well as beta interferon.
There is a testivir efficiency evidence, from March 2020.
Clinical development appeared for patients treated with remedisvir applications.
The III clinical trials run in the United States, China and Italy. Kloroquini, which was originally used to treat malaria was conducted in China in February 2020, using the preliminary results.
However, there is a call to audit of the members of the research.
The Korea Health Authority and China suggested the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute, although it recommends a daily dose of a single grams, it notes that using the rate twice is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA released the consent of the emergency use of hydroxycholoroquine and chloroquine in the discretion of the doctors who treat people with COVID-19.
The original data show the highest amount of interestvirin is necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in a glass tool.
I will startaxonide proposed for further study of the vis after showing the low barrier barrier to SARS-CoV-2. Research has indicated that protein preparation using transmbrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is relevant to the SARS-CV-2 entry through a contact with AC2 receivers.
A study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine whether or not the azithromycin is a major decline that has prevented medical professionals from treating these treatments without further researching. Ostelamir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the composition and plays a known role in COVID-19 treatment.
The existence of a Cytokine protein can in many cases as well as in the future levels of COVID-19.
There is evidence that the hydroxychloroquine medication may be characterized by anti-inflammatory increases of cytokines. Tocilizumba is included in the medical directions of the Chinese National Health Commission after low research is completed.
It is reviewed the 2nd phase of special tests at the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe disease.
Compared with the blood measurement of the ferry serum to realize the increased amount of cytokines, it is intended to deal with such results, which are considered the cause of death among infected people.
The interleukin-6 pin was approved by the FDA due to the subsequent medical research of the disease through the amount of different cytokines, the treatment of the CAR cell, in 2017.
So far, no evidence with special order, controlled that tomicuzumba is the best CRS treatment.
Transfer printed and raised antibodies from the immune systems of the recovered body from COVID-19 to people in need of being investigated as a non-compliance method of vaccination body.
This method was tested for SARS and incomplete results.
The transmission of the virus is the expected method of the stage in which non-lying therapy can bring immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques, such as cell nototomy and/or phogytosis depending on antibodies, are possible.
Other methods of non-committed protective physical treatment, for example, use the genetics for one-way colony are formed.
The production of recovery medication, with a part of the blood liquid from the detected patients and has a antibodies that are specific to the virus, can be increased due to rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenling, a doctor at the University of Wuhan Hospital, who was later infected with the world because of COVID-19 after educating the public about the spread of the virus.
