Increased cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The total number of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) shows a focus in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom to prove that, at a different level based on the countries concerned, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow rapidly in all countries.
According to the situation in Italy, states, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness for an increase in COVID-19 patients who need treatment and especially critical conditions.
On 31 December 2019, a group of unknown pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new coronavirus is now known as acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have moderate cases of the disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections or pneumonia and most of them recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into the most severe form of the disease requiring hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases are of critical condition requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for COVID-19 patients is 4%.
In this study, we assess the total incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare the situation in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of current COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread to geographic areas and the COVID-19 pandemic issues in other parts of the world are now following what is happening in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a major pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the definition of the case according to the WHO.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), of which between 31 December 2019 included 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Find the total number and total number of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the notified number of COVID-19 cases in every country around the world, obtained from official sources such as WHO, is updated every day at 8:00 am.
This data was used to assess current COVID-19 issues in the EU/EEA and the UK, in comparison with those in Italy.
As part of the existing COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total number of COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days, thus taking into account the original source of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the total number of reported cases of each country by 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to that of Italy for the period from 31st January to 15th March 2020.
Current issues regarding COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Current issues in the incidence of COVID-19 cases in the 14 days spent in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the total number of COVID-19 cases began to rise on 21 February and further soar on 28 February 2020 (extra scripture).
This was driven further by an increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but across EU/EEA countries and the UK highlighted similar issues of the increase in the overall incidence of COVID-19 (extra scripture).
Figure 2 shows the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to that of Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of 15 March 8:00 AM, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy in the past 3 weeks or less.
Our findings show that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing dramatically in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The issues raised in the total COVID-19 cases suggested that this pandemic is accelerating at a comparable pace across all countries.
This is despite different countries being at different levels, different in how each public health is coping with the possibility of different visa definitions in the country and different procedures for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including population testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's affected areas identified a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients needed detailed treatment and sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units were already full of the hormone.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA rate at 6% and 1% of the syllabus (data is not shown).
However, they should be collected in a specific order to be used together with current observational data covering the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study showed a significant difference in access to intensive and moderate medical beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have fewer or more resources than Italy (coral beds for people in critical conditions and treatment of moderately 12.5 per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Structural conditions related to the strain on treatment capacity, with estimates of each EU/EEA country and the UK of COVID-19 infections in people at risk of being hospitalized >90% of the beds' capacity to handle people in critical conditions, has been released in the sixth update of the rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since the cases are currently included in certain areas in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically have a specific area of care, information about the cases and intensive care beds should be found in the reference units of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (NUTS-2).
The situation in Italy and the ongoing issues in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for the continuing state of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring treatment and especially the treatment of people in critical conditions, such as those in affected areas of Italy.
As noted in the recent ECDC accelerated risk assessment, a rapid, interoperable, and detachable approach is critical in delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with changes from a control point of view to response, as the expected increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response strategies appropriately if they do not act properly in advance.
A rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to address the impact of a major pandemic.
There is little room for opportunities where countries are able to scale up their regulatory efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on treatment.
Failure to do so, there are likely to be health systems in other EU/EEA countries facing an increase in patients requiring intensive treatment within the next days or weeks.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a pandemic for humans.
Similar to similar viruses, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS among thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms in the same way.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but a greater capacity for adoption and infecting older people than younger men and more men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications about this emerging disease, this article attempts to provide timely review and date of this rapidly evolving research topic.
We will address the underlying issues regarding epidemiology, etiology, variology, diagnostics, treatment, its sources and disease prevention.
While there are still other questions that need to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eliminating this terrible disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has been an unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were encouraged to stay home during the holiday period and for many weeks later due to the outbreak of a new virus-borne disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, the World Health Organization named SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020 and the related disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being admitted home and more than 3,000 dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "public enemy number 1" and is likely to be more violent than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published about COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that identified a series of viral isolation from many patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in a rapidly growing new topic.
Where possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, and outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the origin of the disease as well as some of the questions that have not yet been answered.
Traditional CoVs have been considered a harmless virus in humans, which mainly causes approximately 15% of the common cold 4.
However, in this century, we have experienced two times the most viral human CoVs - SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread rapidly in many other countries with higher rates of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third outbreak of CoV in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, pneumonia clusters that were not first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission in China.
Seven days later, the CoV has been eradicated.
On January 15, 2020, the first case from Wuhan was reported.
At present, the epidemic has spread rapidly in cities, regions and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, infections among medical care providers were reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city's normal operations in Wuhan were closed and public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease was reported, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had directly interacted with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered an area where infection originated from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared this outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of the publication of this report, the disease has already spread across China and around 50 other countries around the world (Photo.2).
As the situation continues to grow, the final scope and the impact of this outbreak remains unclear.
On February 11, 2020, a study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 who were confirmed to have COVID-19 presented a more updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has affected people of all ages, but most of them are aged between 30 and 65.
About half (47.7%) of infected people were over 50, a few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 affected more men (0.31/100,000) than (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded into groups, especially in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average number of 5 days (2-9 days) from the start of the investigation.
The average period of his recovery was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period from his death to his death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The primary population of the generation (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased before 23 January 2020, depending on the time of mass transit ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate for confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.1-1.86%), and the changed patient mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (me), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoV is a small family of large and interconnected viruses with a single RNA sequence.
They can be divided into four types, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, where alpha- and beta strains of CoV are known to infect humans.
The combination of glycoprotein (S) binds to its angiotensin receptor that changes the enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipptdyl peptidease 4 (DPP4) of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then the membrane connection occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the production of the viral genome, the genome RNA as well as the glacoproteins attached to the nucleicapsides proteins form virion-containing components, which are then connected to the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% of genetic identification among the 10 monitored samples collected from the original location of this outbreak, the Huanan Seafood market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV in genetics than MERS-CoV.
Through electronic distribution surveys, fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were found in the narrowest parts of the human airway.
Human ACE2 was found to be a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S protein binds to human ACE2 in a much weaker way than SARS-CoV, a phenomenon consistent with the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a less serious infection in patients compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also create a new short protein with orf3b code and a protein produced with orf8 code.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play a role in viral conditions causing disease and preventing the appearance of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not have any known domain that works.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported the cryo-EM structure of the full height human ACE2 to be a 2.9 Å classification in combination with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the complex, consisting of clear sides and congested locks, was collected as two molecules and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can synthesize two S proteins, which provide evidence of the diagnosis and transmission of CoVs.
B0AT1 may be a medical target for the SARS-CoV-2 infection suppression drug investigation.
Get rid of the virus
It has been known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have origins from bats and were transmitted to humans through cat and camel, respectively.
Through the physiological diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bats were considered to be SARS-CoV-2 carriers as these viruses are 96% identical to SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, the central carrier that helped the virus migrate to humans from a block of that animal species is still unknown and the path of its transmission is not yet known.
Ji and his colleagues suggested snakes to be carriers of viruses from bats to humans, which involved a re-integrative component within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that long-sleeved pangolins, ants who have traditionally been used as Chinese medicine, are more likely to carry SARS-CoV-2, according to 99% of genetic homology found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the percentage spread difference between the two genomes is still a big difference; thus, the perfect result for solid evidence is still pending (Photo 33).
The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be inside test tubes for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days below 20°C and 40%-50% of humidity conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is strongly affected by ultraviolet rays and temperatures of 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% of ethanol, chlorine-containing cleanser, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively suppress this virus.
All humans are generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at risk of acquiring the new virus.
At the moment, no detailed research has been reported regarding the antibody fight against SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies about other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Generally, after the virus invades the carrier, it is first identified by the non-living body system of the carrier through patterns detection receptors (PRR) including lectin-type C-type detectors, Toll-type (TLR), NOD (NLR) detectors, and RIG-I-type (RLR) detectors.
Through different mechanisms, the virus causes the presence of the elements that cause tissue burn, the maturation of dendratic cells and the production of I interferons (IFNs) proteins that control the spread of the virus and accelerate the transfer of proteins that fight the virus.
However, the N-SARS-CoV protein can help the virus evade the body's protective edge.
Soon after, the immune system joins in the fight against the virus.
White T-type blood cells including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells can play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies that respond to specific viruses and CD8+ T cells kill the cells affected by the virus directly.
T helper cells produce cytokine molecules that support the state of burn to help protect cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functioning of T cells by causing the killing of T cells.
Protection in the human body including extras such as C3a and C5a and various antibodies are also important in dealing with viral infections.
For example, antibodies released to the recovered patient destroyed the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, when the body produces excess antibodies it can cause severe lung and other joint damage, and in the worst cases, many organs are not functioning and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, initially highlighted, is more likely to affect older people with other illnesses and pregnant women.
It is common that for people at risk of developing a large number of viruses or whose immune systems are weak, they have a much higher chance of being infected by others.
The estimated estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, often 3-7 days, according to a study of 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a survey of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and was between 0 and 24 days.
The most recent study as described above shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) depending on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is important for the health authorities to adjust the effective time for quarantine based on the same gestation period, thus preventing infected individuals from showing symptoms to transmit the virus to others.
As a common practice, people at risk or infected with the virus usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever in the body is the main and most often the initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be followed by the absence of symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, flu, chest pain, running, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing and/or a low level of clean air in the early stages of the disease.
In the worst case scenario, patients continued to suffer from severe breathing problems, causing the body's organs to function, too many acidity in the body and the blood condition to fail to clot.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of asthma and high fever, even without respiratory problems should be screened for the virus in an early diagnosis.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for difficulty breathing and 3% for running; 8% for patients who needed respiratory support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent family samples and samples from a person who did not have symptoms of the disease.
Comparatively, a 2012 study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and difficulty breathing (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilators, rather than COVID-19 patients, and this coincides with a more severe condition of MERS than COVID-19.
Driving (26%) with a sore throat (21%) also appeared among MERS patients.
For SARS patients, it has been found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), running (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the main symptoms and breathing support machines were needed for 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, the mortality rate for COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
In comparison, the mortality rate for SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, mortality rates were 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was above 6.47 for a 95% accuracy rate (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas SARS-CoV R0 was only for 2 to 4 frequencies.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in relation to their symptoms, death rates and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above data shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV but its edge is lower than the other two.
There is therefore a greater challenge to control the larger SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than to control MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
When it comes to starting out, it often happens in the same family or from a similar collection or car such as a ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with people or patients affected in the last two weeks before starting.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients allowed to return home can carry the virus again, which provides a warning of an extended quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or decreased number of white blood cells of the peripheral (especially lymphocytes) in the initial phase.
For example, the condition of white blood cells deficiency < 4×109/L including the number of lymphocyte < 1×109/L and the induced levels of aspartate amino transferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzyme and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients with C-reactive protein and erythrocyte cleanses increased in the blood of many patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, the product of lowering the fibromyalgia status in the blood, was elevated and the number of lymphocyte continued to decline.
Unprecedented conditions in chest tests were found in most COVID-19 patients and those conditions were combined with two-way shadows or so close to the lungs that they could not be detected.
Patients often have abnormal pneumonia, severe lung injuries and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the event of ARDS, uncontrolled burning, hydraulic assembly and continuous vascular fracturing are negatively contrasted with gas-combination conditions.
Inactivity of type-I and type-II airbags reduces the shock levels of the wet product and exacerbates the region's shock levels, thus reducing the risk of lung enlargement and putting more lung risk not to work.
Therefore, the results of the most serious chest conditions tests are consistent with the most serious level of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 signaled the introduction of the inner parts of the lungs, the structure of the hyaline membrane, the entry of lymphocytes in the body through the multi-nuclear cells in the lungs of the patient who died from the disease, in comparison with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS infections and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through a series of reverse-transscriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) was used as the primary mechanism for COVID-19 testing.
However, due to the high rate of cases of the disease not available through tests, which can spread the epidemic, clinical signs began to be used for testing (which is no longer based on RT-PCR only) in China on 13 February 2020.
The same thing happened with SARS.
Therefore, the total history of disease, clinical manifestations, experiments on the mantras and radiology results is necessary and suitable for performing effective tests.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group defined the procedure for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 in doses of 20×10-18 ml/L to 200×10-18 ml/L (10-100 copies per small liter of your hand) using less than an hour iron without requiring a complex capacity device.
We hope that this new approach can improve in a unique way the relevance and convenience if proven in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of new CoVs, medical professionals can provide support therapy for COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of therapies previously used or recommended to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral-causing diseases ( Table ( Table 2.2).
These treatments include modern and potential treatments with anti-viral drugs, immunosuppression, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, pharmaceutical and psychological support from China.
Even the plasma from the recovered patients was recommended to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are struggling to create antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs in the beginning and may also attack other organs that exhibit ACE2 at a minimum, such as the gas and kidney system.
However, not working through asthma and failure is the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is essential to relieve pain and save lives and includes routine clean air therapy, clean air flow, assisted breathing without using peripheral machinery and assisted breathing by peripheral machines depending on the disease situation.
Patients with severe asthma should be supported through extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and the cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of heart failure or asthma that is dangerous.
Likewise, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating second-hand infections and inactivity in body organs and the protection of vital organs is also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is also known that cytokine eruptions are due to the immune system of patients providing excessive antibodies to fight SARS and MERS.
The cytokine explosion is a form of systemic burns that involve the release of cytokine sequences including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines enter the immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are a major source of ARDS and organ failure often.
Suppression of body immunity is essential in the treatment of cytokine eruptions, especially in patients who are in critical condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 board of a single cell, have been used to treat cytokine eruptions.
Other immunodeficiency treatments for cytokine eruptions include the control of body immunity directed by T cells; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibitors; blinatumob; cytokine inhibition signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, like immunosuppression, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the impact of burn damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially the lack of blood in the bones greatly affected the diagnosis of the disease.
However, small doses of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids have been suggested to be used appropriately to treat patients in severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing the article, there is no effective treatment for the virus that has been confirmed.
However, drug remdesivir is injected into the arteries, a nucleotide containing sugar and phosphate, has been found to be effective in a U.S. patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally created by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola-related disease and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed the prevention of other similar RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
On these grounds, Gilead has offered the drug to China to conduct a pair of tests on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the events are highly expected.
In addition, baricinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested to be a possible treatment for patients with mild respiratory disorders.
Running, nausea, vomiting, liver breakdown and other serious conditions can occur following total therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from patients who recovered from the production of antibodies
The blood collection from patients who recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect health workers from getting the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have higher levels of antibodies compared to pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign substances and they identify specific molecules in nuclei and fight them directly.
As a result, plasma collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 was used to treat 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, including a decrease in inflammation and viral levels and an improvement in the absorption of clean air into the blood.
However, validation and clarity are essential to suggest a method for the use of high doses before specific treatments are created.
Also, when the therapeutic effects are highlighted, some of the deficiencies associated with the plasma should be taken into account carefully.
For example, antibodies can trigger excess body immunity and cause cytokines to be produced, which is likely to have life-threatening contaminants.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is low and the need for plasma is high to treat patients.
It is difficult to create and produce specific antibodies more quickly to combat the global pandemic.
Thus it is more important to extract B cells from recovered patients and to identify genetic codes that infect the effective antibody or to detect effective antibodies against the virus's essential protein.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has also been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for many years.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the integration of many components into a variable formula based on epidemiological studies based on the theories of TCM.
Many of these structures are still unknown or unclear as it is difficult to recover and confirm such structures or their better integration.
At present, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from the worst stage.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing were found to be treating COVID-19 effectively.
High levels of treatment in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in many regions in China that used TCM to treat 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, where TCM was used for only about 30% of their COVID-19 patients, had the lowest treatment rate at 13%.
However, this is a higher correlation because other side effects such as the number and condition of the patients should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing western medicine (WM) treatments alone with the total treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the amount of time needed for restoring the body's temperature, symptom loss and hospitalizations decreased significantly in the WM+TCM group than the WM only group.
The best result is that the rates of symptomatic patients (from mild to severe) decreased significantly for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality rates decreased in the WM+TCM group than the WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Despite this, the efficiency and safety of the TCM are still waiting for more well-regulated tests at greater levels and at more stations.
It would be interesting to give them the characteristics of the action processes and to expose the appropriate components of the TCM treatment or integration as much as possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 often experience severe fear of this highly contagious disease and even kill people, and people in quarantine also experience fatigue, loneliness and anger.
In addition, signs of infection such as fever, lack of adequate air in the body organs and cough as well as serious medical effects such as lack of sleep caused by medications that reduce body burniness can cause anxiety and stress.
In the initial phase of the SARS outbreak, various mental disorders including extreme stress, anxiety, panic attacks, mental distress symptoms, mental distress and even suicide were reported.
Tracking contact with mandatory quarantines, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may raise concerns about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigma on family and friends.
Thus, mental health treatment should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of contacting them as well as the general public they need.
Psychological support should be included in the creation of a variety of mental health, open communication and regular information that is accurate about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and medical programs and the use of professional electronic devices and programs to avoid contact with others.
Effective vaccines are essential to halt the transmission of animals and humans to vulnerable populations and are used as well as treatments against the virus in control of major epidemics caused by the virus.
Efforts are made to create S-protein vaccines to produce a stable and long-term antibody and/or body protection against SARS-CoV.
Severely reduced virus vaccines have been assessed in animal models for SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these vaccines in older people and their standards structures to kill viruses and protections against animal-borne viruses has not yet been identified before clinical research has been launched.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new infections have been reported since then.
In comparison, the cases and concentration of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to zoonotic sources in areas that are endemic to the disease.
Vaccine strategies are designed for MERS using disabled viruses, DNA plasmids, viral currents, small particles, viruses-like particles and micro-protein units reattached to others have been evaluated in animal structures.
The creation of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in immunodeficiency individuals is an urgent and critical responsibility to manage this ongoing pandemic.
However, there is a challenge to overcome this difficulty due to the long-term required (on average 18 months) to create a vaccine with a range of CoV-changing factors.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to fully manifest itself medically in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without conditions caused by the disease.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a higher risk of developing disease and mortality rates in patients with severe conditions.
Therefore, developing a medical experience-based structure is essential for healthcare organizations to prioritize their services, especially in areas with insufficient resources.
According to the medical research reported so far, these parameters may be affected or associated with the presence of COVID-19 in patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was a key factor in studying SARS, which is also a fact in COVID-19.
COVID-19 primarily occurred in people aged 30 to 65 with 47.7% of those patients having more than 50 in 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have other conditions of illness and problems and were older than those who did not (at the average age of 66 versus 51) and signal age as a criterion for the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Diseases and pre-existing health conditions: Patients with COVID-19 who needed treatment are more likely to be infected with a severe heart injury and heart failure.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death for SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect to the ACE2-positive lining bag cells, which can lead to the malfunction of the liver of COVID-19 patients.
It is important to mention that age and chronic diseases have strong relationships and can overlap.
Unusual results of migraines. The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects burn status or tissue injury and has been suggested as a criterion for recovery ability, state of receiving therapy and recovery eventually.
The relationship between CRP levels and weight and the ability to recover from COVID-19 has also been proposed.
Also, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are manifested in large quantities within many organs of the body, especially within the heart and liver and are produced during tissue breakdown.
Thus, they are the traditional signs of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest testing and temporary development of clinical symptoms should be considered as well as other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs that are widely used as an additional treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the rate of burn damage.
As high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs were widely used in patients with severe SARS conditions, many of the victims suffered from a lack of blood in the bones and long-term disability and poor quality of life.
So, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods for COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from unusual stress as they endured long periods of quarantine and a state of enthusiasm and saw the deaths of close family members and their patients.
It is important to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help patients recover from stress and to refer to the normal state of life.
According to a demographic study so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to being produced in a lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be produced in the upper part of the respiratory tract effectively causing mild symptoms or not showing any symptoms in the initial phase of the infection, similar to other CoVs that transmit high fever.
Thus, infected patients in the early phase or during the incubation period can produce high viral load during daily activities, resulting in greater difficulty for epidemic control.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was observed to occur when patients are seriously ill, although most transmissions did not take place in the early phase.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is even worse and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
Significant efforts are currently underway in China including the closure of routine operations in Wuhan and nearby cities and the continuation of quarantine for almost all people in the hope of disrupting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been detrimental to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has decreased and signaled a decline in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that this outbreak will end in March and its impact phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and his colleagues estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and her colleagues developed a mechanism to predict the consequences of the pandemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two thirds of people around the world.
A group of Canadians reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in air currents and throats of patients who recovered from the hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that newly identified viruses could be reversible periods such as influenza.
However, optimistic signs have emerged in China on the basis of a decline in the number of new cases, suggesting that current strategies may have been working.
Ebola was initially predicted to have caused up to one million cases and killed half a million people.
However, through strict quarantine and quarantine regulations, the disease is finally under control.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may be weak in infection and eventually die or have a lower viral load and be found in humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Photo.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is further spread through cough or sneezing and can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected devices.
The virus was also found in feces which raises the possibility of a new transmission from feces to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were caused by infections within the hospital, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 medical providers.
Therefore, greater attention should be taken to protect human beings, especially health care providers, community workers, family members, co-workers and even other people who touch sick or infected people.
The first step to avoid being used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; using medical masks and N95 respirators (versions of # 1860) helps control the spread of the virus.
Medical face masks prevent fluid droplets from someone who may have been infected against being transported to the air or stuck in parts of the product, where they can pass on to other people.
However, only the N95 masks (versions of # 1860) can protect against breathing into small embryos even at doses of 10 to 80 nm, with 5% of those embryos being fully penetrated; SARS-CoV-2 is the equivalent of SARS-CoV in size and is approximately 85 nm.
Since small pieces can penetrate even the five masks put together, health care providers contacting patients must wear N95 masks (versions # 1860) but not medical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear masks with features needed to further reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect people through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 although he wore a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyes that were turning him on.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear face masks or sunglasses while dealing with patients.
In general public in the affected or most vulnerable areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more soap than usual, try to stay at home in self-quarantine and reduce contact with people who may be infected.
Three meters is considered a suitable distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus came as a new virus to the human world, its similarity to SARS-CoV as it passed away on 7 January 2020 would have to pay greater attention to China due to their memories of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by stating that the new virus has low rates of transmission and low reproducibility from person to person and that it is not a problem preventing and controlling this disease.
This message significantly reduced public concern, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they failed to deal with the disease when it was not spread further to Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies can regret this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these organizations should be (1) more careful when making public announcements because each term has implications for citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more careful and take unusual steps from clinics than wait to receive official reports from doctors or officials; (3) put in place additional restrictions to control the risk of a pandemic in its initial phase than trying to reassure the public and (4) consistently provide more effective trials to raise public awareness about pandemics and try to improve the community response system over time.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries around the world by the time we write it.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the assumption of a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some fundamental differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important in managing this pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more people than young men and women than women and its weight and mortality rates are higher among older people than young people.
SARS causes death by a higher percentage than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they do not show any symptoms while SARS patients are doing so in extreme cases, which causes more difficulty controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in turn why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A typical SARS-CoV-2 RNA test may occur negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, treated patients can be diagnosed with this virus again.
This increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
Due to the rapid progress of research on COVID-19, many key issues have not yet been resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 virus come from?
Although 96% genetic diversity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-derived SARS-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from bats.
Which animal was the medium to carry and transmit the virus from the natural host, for example from bats to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2 questions, we can't stop this supply effectively and this outbreak can happen again at any time.
Although molecular structures and biochemistry experiments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 warms up and becomes ACE2, what exactly is the virus entering the respiratory cells and causing the next pathological changes?
Does this virus also connect cells that show ACE2- in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we can't achieve accurate testing and proper treatment.
How long will it last?
How does the virus develop in the course of human transmission?
Will you be a global pandemic, will you die as a SARS or happen again over time such as the flu?
It is important but you can take some time to find answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, despite its cost, we have no choice but to end this pandemic as soon as possible and restore life to normal.
The origins of human coronavirus disease
The changes in the body and environment have contributed to the growth of the coronavirus (CoVs) and its carriers, including humans for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common colds.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed things and revealed how HCoV infections can be life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made the coronavirus once again a reality and surprised us with its high spread potential but reduced the risk of causing the disease compared to the SARS-CoV variant.
HCoV infection comes from animals and understanding the origins of HCoV infection from animals can help us.
Most HCoVs came from bats where they were not able to cause disease.
Some of the HCoVs are also known.
Identifying an animal carrier is directly involved in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the interactions of the CoV carrier in animals can also greatly help to gain valuable insights into the potential of CoVs to cause disease in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven types of HCoV, by highlighting the history of its discovery as well as its origins in animals and its transmission from one animal species to another.
Very important, we compare and differentiate different types of HCoVs with the perception of viral substitution and replication of the genome.
The current COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) has been discussed in this context.
Also, the requirements for the success of the carrier's flexibility and the effect of the virus' growth on the seriousness of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, consisting of a group of connected viruses, with positive emotions and the same type of RNA.
The virus with the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobes among RNA viruses was called "CoVs" due to their shape as a crown under electronic surveillance.
Structurally, the CoV has genomes that do not contain the same sequences.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open-loop frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), converted to pp1a-type protein and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
Polyprotein is mainly processed to produce 16 non- structural proteins, designed as nsp1~16.
The initial component of the genome contains ORF structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific reproductive proteins have been classified by different generations of CoVs.
According to the variation in protein sequences, the CoV is classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among them, the beta-CoV genera contains the most active HCoV and is divided into four generations (A, B, C and D).
Phytogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as sources of alpha-CoV gene and multiple beta-CoVs, with birds being the main reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
For thousands of years, CoVs have evolved beyond animal-type restrictions and some have emerged as the main causes of human disease.
To date, there are seven known types of human CoVs (HCoVs).
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The five other types of beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus (SARS-CoV) of severe respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 often cause mild symptoms, such as common colds and/or running.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 viruses are highly pathogenic, causing severe infection in the lower respiratory tract in more patients with acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and non-external lung disorders.
The first form of HCoV-229E, B814, was extracted from the fluids from the nostrils of patients with common colds in the mid 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been gathered through extensive research into the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, all of which cause symptoms of personal weakness.
Indeed, the assumption was accepted among many that HCoVs are generally harmless until the SARS outbreak occurred.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the worst in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a fatality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused an ongoing epidemic in the Arab Peninsula and spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the leading cause of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The world needs to be prepared for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are native to bats, rodents or domestic animals.
Much of the evidence supports the origins of the growth of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are common and have no potential to cause disease but indicate a wide range of genetic conditions.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges in China and the world.
Tracking the source of HCoVs from animals provides a mechanism for understanding natural history, motivation and disease prevention criteria to spread between species of animals.
This can also lead to or facilitate search for reservoirs, central carriers and carriers of SARS-CoV-2, with the effect of preventing overcrowding in the future.
In this review we present an overview of animal origin, distribution among animal species and the potential of HCoVs to cause disease.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoVs are usually not able to cause disease within their natural host but are able to cause disease after they have been transmitted between species of animals to a new host.
We also review the current development issues of HCoVs where increased transmission capacity often coincides with a decrease in disease-causing capacity.
The results of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the release of the first HCoV-229E strain B814 from liquids extracted from the nostrils of patients exposed to high fevers, various CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, including hiccups, rats, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV discovery in the temporal order (Table 1) can be informative and instructive.
The first form of HCoV-229E was released in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, and later continued to grow in the pulmonary currents of the WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed symptoms of common cold, including headache, sneeze, fatigue and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from link development and implantation in the brains of breastfed mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be statistically distinguished from those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
The HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have spread all over the world, and appear to be more widespread during the monsoon season in moderate weather.
Generally, the time between infection and the emergence of the virus is less than a week and, followed by an illness of approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study of human volunteers, infected health workers with HCoV-229E had a relatively common cold.
Only a few patients whose immune systems are weak showed severe respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "extraordinary pneumonia", was the first epidemic caused by HCoVs in human history recorded by the hierarchical agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV detected.
The first case of SARS can be traced to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province in China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases of 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
In addition to the main parasites, it was estimated that each case would cause approximately two cases and a period between 4 to 7 days of infection and maximum viral load appearing on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show signs of pain in the muscles, headache, fever, fatigue and cold, then respiratory problems, cough and difficulty breathing like future symptoms.
The reduction of lymphocytes in the blood, the study of the functioning of the damaged liver, and the increase in kritian kinase is a rare study of SARS.
Alveola depletion, increased epithelia cells and increased macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive treatment with ventilators and ventilators.
With a lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine explosion, which can be particularly dangerous for patients whose immune systems have been compromised.
The virus was first isolated from a patient who had travelled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.
Since then, efforts have been made to investigate HCoVs.
The HCoV-NL63 virus was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially discovered to spread among young children, elderly people and patients whose immune systems were affected by respiratory diseases.
The appearance of flu, inflammation of the eye, fever and bronchitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study identified the same virus from an eight-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although they were discovered in the Netherlands, they spread throughout the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and occurs most frequently during the initial dry, autumn and winter periods.
The HCoV-NL63 virus is associated with a sore throat, also called a croup.
The same year, the HCoV-HKU1 virus was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and blocked airways in the lungs in Hong Kong.
In addition to social distributed pneumonia and airborne blockages in the lungs, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with a sharp increase in the binding of asthma.
The same virus as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 were found worldwide causing relatively asthma.
All of these socially transmitted HCoVs have found a way to stay in humans better and less likely to evolve to cause viral disease, although accidents occurred for unknown reasons as in rare cases of the most viral type HCoV-NL63, which has recently caused severe respiratory tract infections in China.
In general, these HCoVs have been able to transmit effectively and maintain themselves in humans, and their viral or pathogenic capacity is also declining.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung patient who developed severe pneumonia and died of urinary tract failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed cases were in the Middle East, cases from foreign countries spread frequently to people close to them were reported in Europe and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical signs of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by persistent severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also experienced urinary failure, which is very unique to MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients show signs of stomach problems, such as running and being diagnosed.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases of the virus have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the worst known human viruses.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a collection of pneumonia patients previously known to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of acute respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a fatality rate of 3.4%.
The death rate in Hubei province, China, is 4.2%, while the outside of the region is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, characterized as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
It also affects some patients.
pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can continue to develop rapidly and become a severe respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 closely resemble each other due to the high nucleotide sequence of 82%, they connect to different branches in the epigenetic diagram.
It is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is less likely to cause disease but its transmission is higher than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People who do not show symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been confirmed and can contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with other six types of HCoVs has given rise to striking similarities and differences.
First, the period between infection and emerging with the presence of HCoV is the same.
As a result, the SARS-CoV-2 virus follows the normal fluctuation of other HCoVs.
Second, the weight of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four socially distributed HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are commonly seen during the transmission of the HCoV, including showing non-specific symptoms, amounts or even absence of any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although tests are much lower.
Third, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 also shows an impressive pattern of HCoVs distributed socially by SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the potential for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the socially distributed HCoV.
On the other hand, it will remain to be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2's transmission capacity decreases after human adoption as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a stool sample.
If the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the mouth plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances it remains exposed through future research.
It is also interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 virus can occur in seasons as in the cases of social spread HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including the ability to transmit, the ability to infect and continue to circulate after human adoption will have an influence on the fate of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four social-spread HCoVs that cause moderate symptoms are human.
In other words, it may also be the fact that humans have become accustomed to these four HCoVs.
In other words, they may all be survivors of past HCoV disasters.
The HCoV that causes severe diseases in humans and humans with severe HCoV diseases has been eliminated.
This is what happens, the HCoV must be produced in humans to the appropriate extent to allow for the accumulation of mutations that can fight the virus carrier's regulatory criteria.
In this context, the more SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks develop and the more people become infected, the more likely it is that it will be familiar to humans.
If the virus is properly spread, its transmission to humans can be difficult to control through quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four social-spreading CoVs have spread among people, triggering common colds among people/animals with stable immunity.
The virus does not require protection in animals.
On the contrary, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that are most widely distributed are not well adapted to humans and their transmission among humans cannot be controlled.
They need to maintain and sustain their reservoirs within animals and seek space for targeted humans at risk, possibly through a second carrier and spreading them.
SARS-CoV-2 has the same characteristics as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-distributed HCoVs.
They are more likely to be distributed such as the social distributed HCoV, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than the social spread HCoV and its potential to cause disease is lower than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It will remain to be seen whether they will be fully adapted to humans and spread within human beings without shelter or animal carrier.
Before discussing the origins of HCoVs, it would be advisable for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the growth carrier, nature, conservation and transmission carrier of HCoVs.
The animal serves as a growth HCoV carrier if it has kept a close lineage of the same at the level of a series of nucleotides.
The virus is usually common and has no ability to cause disease within the carrier.
Also, the host that is the reserve tends to have HCoVs on a regular and long-term basis.
In all cases, carriers of the virus are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoVs or their respective strains of the virus.
On the contrary, if the HCoV has first entered the intermediate carrier before or around its human entry, it is not well adapted to the new environment and often causes illness.
This intermediate host can be used as a source due to human transmission and performs the carrier's role by allowing viruses to be produced and then transmitted to humans to increase the rate of infection in humans.
HCoVs can undergo non-impact transmission if they are unable to maintain their transmission within the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also be common within its intermediate host and even create long-term disease conditions.
In this case, the central carrier becomes a natural host that stores the virus.
The epidemiological data revealed in a back-up that the index of SARS had a history of association with wild animals.
The following infection rate study indicated that animal traders had higher anti-SARS-CoV igG levels compared to the general population.
Face masks (Paguma larvata) and sani dogs in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported after the slaughter of all the chicks on the market.
However, it has been reported that masks from wild or rural areas are not compatible with the animals sold on the market, most of whom are not found with SARS-CoV, suggesting that face masks can only be used as intermediate spread carriers but are not the original reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It will be noted that, since 80% of the different animals in the Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that many species of small mammals can also be used as intermediate spreaders of SARS-CoV cannot be ignored.
All of these seem to have no effect on SARS-CoV.
The next finding of an animal that is a natural host of SARS-CoV showed that the virus closely related to bats, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), is found in the Chinese bats of horsehoe.
These bats have antibodies against SARS-CoV and a series of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomes.
These and other bat CoVs contain 88-92% identical nucleotide sequences containing SARS-CoV.
This study has laid the foundation for the new assumption that bats carry the emergence of human viruses.
Several similar CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but none of them except WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The human hormone that causes blood pressure changing the enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
The virus WIV1 released on a sample of bat feces was shown to use bats, lice and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the serums from SARS-recovery patients were able to destroy the WIV1.
To date, the WIV1 virus represents the closest generation of SARS-CoV in bats, with 95% of the same nucleotide sequence.
For the greatest example among these viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the intermediate virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not intermediate carriers who store SARS-CoV.
Phogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5 viruses.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptors, dipptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent sequences of MERS-CoV polymerases are almost identical to those within the bat beta-CoV virus identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no active MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest community of bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the central reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, a study conducted in the Middle East has shown that the tallest camels have a specific antibody leveling MERS-CoV, similar to the Middle East's native camels in many African countries.
The virus-like MERS-CoV found in humans was released from the nose samples from the longest camels, further indicating that camels could serve as the true reservoir hosts of the MERS-CoV virus.
It is also important to keep in mind that usually relatively mild but common symptoms with viral delivery are generally seen in camels infected with MERS-CoV for testing.
It is evident that infected camels provide the virus not only through respiratory tract but also through feces, which is also a major way to extract the virus from bats.
However, questions have not yet been answered as many cases of people confirmed to have MERS do not have a history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms, and strongly indicate human infection to humans or unknown distribution routes involving species of undiagnosed animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% of nucleotides similar to the CoV RaTG13 bat found in rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much greater so that they cannot be classified as cervical-related.
That is to say, bats are probably not the closest reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless the virus of nearby bats is found in the future.
It can be taken that, the intermediate host animal of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the species of wild animals that are sold and killed in the Huanan Seafood General Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 were associated, pointing to the possibility of an animal-to-human transmission event.
Many recent studies focusing on the electromagnetic chain have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals such as pangolins (Manis Javanica) can carry the traditional beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These CoV genomes from pangolins contain 85-92% of the sequence of nucleotides homology similar to SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 to approximately 90% of the identities at the level of the nucleotide series.
It is arranged in two sub-species of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the epigenetic diagram, one of them having the same binding receptor receptor (RBD) as SARS-CoV-2, containing 97.4% of the amino acid sequence recognition.
In a clear comparison, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 virus RBDs are quite different, although a large amount of the same genome sequence is the same.
Previous studies on pangolins also reported the virus's detection in kidney samples that, in turn, appeared to be related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used different methods of collection and modification to produce a semi-circumcision of the genome consisting of 86.3% of the total length of the virus' genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 due to a series of differences between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoVs related to the pangolin SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between the beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 detected by pangolins.
The path to the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains recognizable.
Although the most advanced sequence similarity was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 found in pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome sequencing similarity.
It is widely assumed that the high level of similarity between the RBDs of the beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 virus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the growth of the concentration brought about on the basis of selection.
Another proposal supports the reintegration of the beta-CoV-related SARS-CoV-2 virus found in pangolins and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in growth, re-integration spread among beta-CoV viruses.
The decision is yet to be made regarding the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
In addition to the main potential of HCoV causing diseases, the origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 from animals have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat-CoV, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found within the rat community.
It has been reported that the bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the North American three-colored bat showed close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCoV-229E was genetically related to other bat CoVs, called Hipposideros/GhanaWam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with small camel community animals also suspected of being its central carrier.
Clearly, the current knowledge about the animal origin of the known HCoV is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the incidence of HCoV transmission among animal species in history.
When the HCoV-OC43 virus spread between animals and infected humans from animals around 1890, an epidemic of asthma was observed.
The history of transmission between animals of HCoV-229E is unclear.
An alpha-CoV of bats closely related to HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the viruses is the alpha-CoV, which is a type of animal.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus directly from bats to humans.
First, humans and not alpaca who are animals may have been exposed to bats in a shared ecological environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to the animal alpaca.
Second, the alpha-CoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are different and are less likely to cause disease in bats, while the alpha-CoV found in alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV found in alpaca is not found in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility of alpha-CoV-related infection with HCoV-229E from humans cannot be excluded.
Indeed, bats are the direct source of the virus that causes illness in humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats are able to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, although the alpha-CoV is used as a gene domain for HCoV-229E, alpaca and the longest camel may be used as intermediate host for viruses in humans, especially in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV is used as the best example of the transmission between animals from bats to long camels and from tall camels to humans.
The growth origin of MERS-CoV from bats is found in its first detection and also confirmed by the subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a central collection of viruses for the exchange between animals of genetic components and the distribution between animals.
Long-term living capacity, densely populated habitats, close social interactions and strong flying ability are conditions that make bats 'a virus-borne animal'.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the camels for decades.
They were well adapted within these camels who have turned from the central carriers of the virus to stable and natural carriers who keep the virus alive.
MERS-CoV causes very little disease and maintains a low level of flexibility compared to these animals.
Its immediate distribution to humans is accidental and humans remain the last non-communicable MERS-CoV carriers because its transmission is unsustainable.
Conversely, the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV that can be detected by pangolins has a significant potential to cause disease within the pangolins.
They may be the beta-CoV virus hosts related to SARS-CoV-2-infectable, similar to those in SARS-CoV conditions.
Several potential transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 between organisms from animals to humans must be accepted or rejected in future research.
First, bats may be reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2-like SARS-CoV-2 virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological environments with bats through slaughtering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the central viral loaders who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time.
Humans get the virus through slaughtering and eating wild animals.
There is a possibility that many mammals including domestic animals can get SARS-CoV-2.
The study of domestic animals and wild animals for the antibody is eligible.
Third, as mentioned above, re-integrating and traditionalization of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third organism that interacted with bats and pangolins.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from animals is still ongoing.
In addition to different types of carriers, the three main criteria on the viral side are also important in enabling the virus to spread to organisms.
First of all, their high conversion rates in RNA production.
Compared with other single RNA viruses, the estimated conversion rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" or "high" with the average exchange rate being ~10-4 per year per 2 area, depending on the traditional phase of CoV in its new host.
The CoVs contain exorbonucleic acid, which in turn causes an increase in the ability to change, reduce the effect or even its capacity.
Interestingly, nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to suppress the production of CoV through the inhibition of x-rays and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Remdesivir is one of the most powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines underwent clinical trials.
However, the conversion rate of CoVs is approximately a million times higher than that of its carriers.
Also, mutation rates are often higher when the CoV is not common in the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high conversion rates, SARS-CoV-2 conversion rates are noted to be low, indicating a higher likelihood of human addiction.
It can be assumed that they have already been adapted to another nearby carrier.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also used for MERS-CoV, a virus that is well-liked within the longest camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic mutations can make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, a large RNA genome on CoVs is more able to change shape in genome modification for mutations and reintegration, thus increasing the likelihood of growth among organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are favorable.
This is backed by a special wide open frame with the functioning of the coded proteins towards the end of the 3rd genome.
Third, random CoVs and occasionally change the template during RNA production through a specific "copy-choice" mechanism.
Within the virus carrier used as a mixing instrument, strand switching occurs frequently during transcription of CoV RNA.
The most common full-length and small-scale RNA can be re-integrated to produce new CoVs.
Philosophical evidence of natural reintegration was found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as the CoVs found in animals such as the SL-CoV virus of bats and the CoV-HKU9 virus of bats.
Virus carrier interaction associated with distribution
In addition to the three virus variables mentioned above, the host's viral receptor interaction is another important factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, re-integration of SARS-CoV is considered a common pattern, which also showed evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission events.
According to the analogy analysis between SARS-CoV in humans and the hives, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly common within different carriers, especially for changes in the RBD of S protein.
In general, RBD in CoV S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is broadly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318 and 510 amino acids in the S1 piece, which meets the human ACE2 as well as the main receptors for viral insemination.
SARS-CoV RBD is capable of identifying ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, lice, rats and dogs, and allowing the transmission of viruses between organisms.
Indeed, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from the virus isolated from humans and cages on the RBD and 4 of them are in the place of connecting receptors for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV contained within Ngawa mutations of K479N and S487T on their RBD, which may increase the likelihood of S protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, the conversion of these two amino acids can be important in a common virality in humans.
It is important to note that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptors as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the human protein suggests that S protein's ability to connect to human ACE2 may have changed.
Of course, the cryo-EM study shows a 10- to 20-fold more viscosity potential of this viscosity than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would be interesting to find out if any other diagnostics could be needed for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also reacts to ACE2 but in a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as HCoV-229E aminopeptides, and 9-O-acetylated HCoV-OC43 anti-glycemic acid.
It can also lead to the normal efficacy of this CoV in humans after it is transmitted between organisms from their host animals.
Along with cellular receptors, the effects of HCoV transmission between organisms are also governed by dependence by other carriers and barrier parameters.
The difference between human and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, the longest camel and rodents can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The HCoV must invade the host's dependence components and change the host's barrier features to successfully transmit the virus between organisms.
In this case, the molecular reagents in this important part of the interaction between the virus and its host are not yet identified and classified.
An in-depth review of the host of the genome dependent on the inhibitory parameters of SARS-CoV-2 using its CRISPR technology is likely to be fruitful.
The emergence of the new HCoV: a complete regression
Various types of bat CoV provide abundant opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, the bat CoV serves as a gene collection of various HCoVs.
With it, rapid flexibility and genetic connectivity also facilitate the growth of HCoVs and they become two important steps in this process.
For example, finding or losing a new protein-coding gene is likely to quickly change a viral sample.
Among the SARS-CoV accessibility proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in human genetics, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were released but were found to encrypt ORF8 different proteins.
The discovery of 29 SARS-CoV nucleotides has been confirmed in samples released at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This finding divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a traditional change that facilitates the conversion of virus carriers.
Similarly, SARS-CoV is likely to have a history of connections to alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small areas of connectivity components were identified in RNA-dependent polymers.
Connectivity areas were also identified in nsp9, nsp10 and nsp14 sections.
Also, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic witnessed the connection events between different generations, occurring in the longest camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of reintegrating into other HCoVs have also been observed, where different HCoVs are reintegrated with other animal CoVs on their unformed genes.
Caution should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to uninhibited changes in viral genomes, often due to the removal of invasive viruses, such as the host body's immune system.
An example of these effects is the complete disappearance of ORF4 in the initial sample of HCoV-229E, due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 is more likely to be detected in bats and camels related to HCoV-229E, the alpha-CoV found in the alpaca showed a single nucleotide placement, resulting in a frame change.
Finally, the growth of the new HCoV also stems from the pressure of selection on the reservoir of the virus carrier.
The absence of symptoms or quantitative symptoms were discovered when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating mutual familiarity between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that the CoVs were adapted to better physical and functional bats.
For example, an error in response to the burning conditions in bats succeeded in reducing the ability to cause CoV-enabled disease.
Similarly, the activity of natural killer cells in bats has been limited due to the production of NKG2/CD94 inhibitors for natural killer cells and the low rate of type I molecules of tissue density.
In addition, the high amount of active oxygen species (ROS) produced from many activity in the body of bats can suppress the CoV's spectrum and affect the testicle, thus giving the selection pressure for the production of the virus species with the greatest potential to cause disease when it is introduced into the new environment.
More samples of causing CoVs can grow through re-integrating, resulting in the availability of new proteins or protein qualities for more common on the carrier.
Therefore, it is not by chance that three new HCoVs have emerged over the past two decades.
The CoV is not capable of causing disease or causing mild symptoms to their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
It is produced in large quantities without exhibiting strong body immunity to its carrier.
Here's a secret about why symptomatic carriers are found and what causes severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms often result from excessive body immunity and cytokine eruptions where the body's immune system is more stable, the lungs are more damaged.
On the other hand, in symptomless carriers, antibodies are separated from the production of CoV.
A similar strategy for the separation of antibodies can be useful in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The effect of the protein produced by the host virus is particularly strong on bats.
Thus, the provision of the protein produced by the host of type I virus at least in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is harmful.
In this context, the prevention of NLRP3 inflammasome using MCC950 can be significant in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows a holistic approach where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
Although the bat beta-CoV with a 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also bat-CoVs with a 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
Although bat and other animals on the market have been exposed to a virus similar to SARS-CoV, close-knit SARS-CoV-2 carriers have not been identified.
The Beta-CoVs found in pangolins have been found to be very similar to SARS-CoV-2, this suggests that pangolins can be intermediate carriers or beta-CoVs that can contribute gene fragments to the final SARS-CoV-2 strain.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been intentionally developed by humans.
The CoV has been reoccurring due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has quickly changed our focus on the importance of zoonotic origins and the conservation of HCoVs in the distribution of humans.
Widespread evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have origins from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate carriers.
Since SARS-CoV infection is a result of human-to-human bonding on the market, closing the animal markets and killing all of the animals there would have been helpful in ending the SARS epidemic.
In the same logic, pangolins should be removed from the animal market to prevent animal transmission, due to the discovery of multiple generations of beta-CoVs that can be observed closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins, and other mammals remain exposed to future surveillance.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in the camels longer.
These camels serve as a useful tool in transporting as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather products and cotton products to street populations.
They spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to kill all camels in order to control MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the repeated outbreaks of MERS, a dot trend should be taken to create a viable vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, as well as other infection control strategies.
Because we can't eliminate this virus, new species can emerge and cause outbreaks.
Many species of CoV transmitted by animals are distributed in the wild.
In particular, the CoV caused by bats capable of being transmitted by animals is extremely diverse.
There are many opportunities where these animal-borne CoVs grow and regroup, resulting in the emergence of other CoVs that are more and/or more dangerous to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned in order to reduce the compatibility between humans and animals.
Due to the presence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the situation to prepare well and the response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have been present in the world for a long time.
The virus lives in their natural habitat until there is a chance of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that facilitate the spread of the virus, human space to interact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are educated to stay away from them.
It is important to continue the investigation of animals to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural carriers, which will prove important in preventing transmission from animal to human and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus from animals is for humans to stay away from the ecological environment of the natural reservoirs of the virus transmitted from animals.
There are still many unknowns about the origins of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, if bats transmit the traditional SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see in which conditions bats and pangolins can be found in the same ecological environment.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it should be noted how humans interact with bats.
Third, if the third mammal serves as a real intermediate host, it should be identified how the animal interacts with other organisms including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since other animals including domestic animals may be at risk of developing SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental transmission should be conducted.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or another animal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its next-of-its-kind virus will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
The continuation of the investigation in this field will determine the pathway to the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with a significant impact being in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Improving the testing procedure for the "suspected case" and the "confirmed case" of COVID-19 is essential
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and the guide provided our experience and set a good reference for fighting this great pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge continue to grow based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; thus, testing and treatment strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our guide and provided a more up-to-date procedure for testing of the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Test and Treatment Guidelines (the seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a major pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has created a quick consultation guide and has been published online in the Army Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has been a huge hit since its release.
However, keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are growing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience, so, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, provided a total of seven versions with some context changing content.
Now our guide received feedback from Zhou and colleagues., they brought a simple proposal to get the agency based on their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and also made a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We recommend their important work and give our thanks.
However, their work also needs to be updated in line with the latest COVID-19 Testing and Treatment Guidelines (the seventh trial version) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to verify suspected cases requires to include any single element of epidemiological history and two aspects of clinical manifestations in order to carry out an investigation or requirement to meet three aspects of clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
A history of travel or living in Wuhan and the surrounding areas or communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the previous 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive tests of nuclear acid); (3) a history of contact with patients with mild or acute symptoms from the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas or communities where COVID-19 was reported in the previous 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a collection of confirmed cases (2 or more cases of fevers and/or respiratory symptoms present within 2 weeks in small areas, such as at home, office, classroom etc.)
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or asthma symptoms; (2) visible symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells showing a normal, decreased number of white blood cells in the early phase.
Tests for confirmed cases should be based on the case consisting of any suspected item of epidemiological evidence or serology as follows: (1) the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in real-time through PCR tests; (2) the entire chain of viral genome showing a major similarity with the novel coronavirus known; (3) the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum doses; or the conversion of specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 absent to or quadrupled in the recovery phase beyond the critical phase of the disease.
We can see that a real-time PCR test for nuclear acid on the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to the second version (January 18, 2020) and the third (January 22, 2020).
The pathological discovery of the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (January 27, 2020) by the fifth edition (February 8, 2020); and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These adjustments according to the researchers continued the work of finding the best nuclear acid detection package for rapid testing, including samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples and helped bring about positive results of specific antibodies in a proven procedure.
Besides, there is much more evidence that reminds us to be cautious with patients with mild symptoms and those with no symptoms.
Thus, Zhou's chart with colleagues should be updated, because it classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be validated in future clinical actions and research.
In conclusion, we hope more direct evidence will emerge and we encourage readers to share their opinions.
For testing "suspected case" and "certified case", we recommend compliance with the new guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update at the appropriate time for our guidance to provide support.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily reported cases
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded cases including 114 cases and 33 cases of recovered people living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news report, the director of the IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were for people over the age of 60, two for 51 to 60 years and one for 41-50 years.
He also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu, a local news agency that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director at the Bengani Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Minister of Transport Obaidul Quader said public transport would be temporarily closed more than originally planned, until next Saturday.
The closure of this public transport had begun initially on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4th.
Transport of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on 8 March, for two people who returned from Italy as well as the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three men had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than one million cases worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) passed one million around the world, data from Johns Hopkins University showed.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
This was the same day Malawi confirmed its first case of coronavirus and Zambia confirmed the first death related to the virus.
North Korea announced on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m., Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, including at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by the coronavirus.
All over the world, several countries have introduced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russian citizens will remain unpaid until 30 April.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favour, ten of which chose not to vote with one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the day of sulphur in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; initially, the curfew was between 3 pm and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement the curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state extended the stay-at-home order by May 1.
Australian companies have reduced the amount of paper they can buy.
On the evening of Sundays and Saturdays, Australian supermarkets Woolworths and Coles lowered their bottlenecks to two bundles and one respectively for each transaction at the national level.
Aldi also launched a single package limit, on Monday.
These limits were published as messages in payment sites and on the Facebook pages of stores.
Buyers were reportedly buying goods in large quantities due to the fear of COVID-19 if people needed to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolsworth also set limits for the purchase of shale paper from home delivery to one package per order.
These changes followed the initial four packages limits for each transaction set by Woolsworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in a press release on 8 March, reported that even after putting in a four-sheet package limit, "some shops were still selling all paper products within an hour of submission", citing the demand as "unexpected", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, described it as "unexpected".
Sales increased "by a high increase" last week, according to a Wolsworths spokesperson.
The Costco store in Canberra also set limits on the amount allowed to be two packages last week.
In order to cope with the shortfall, Coles imported large packages from the product and added for the regular delivery of the product, Woolworths ordered additional products, while ALDI developed the product for Wednesday's special plans much earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Retailers Association in Australia, said that retail retailers were trying to increase products, but local council restrictions on the timing of delivering goods by car had crippled his mind.
He expects a rise in production costs, with suppliers trying to meet specific needs and plans.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that early release of the product, some shops could not run a special Wednesday program.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail sales specialist from the Queensland University of Technology, said that their stores fill out products every night.
He mentioned that the shashi paper is a great product, which makes up a small number of products and when sold, leaves a large portion of their shelves empty and increases the sense of inadequacy.
Coles and Woolworths have a view that if there were enough products on the shelf, if products such as shaky sheets and barbers were to be bought and available in bulk, there is a possibility to reduce anxiety, said Russell Zimmerman.
A company producing shashi paper based on papers used by Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they had sold all their products.
Kimberly-Clark, the company producing Kleinex Toilet Tissue and Solaris Paper forming Sorbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain product distribution, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a residential area, reported that some of the property sellers provided a shaky paper for the first auction in Melbourne, while a few auctions were made due to buyers getting a holiday due to the long weekend of Labor Day.
Thursday's NT News, a daily newspaper in Darwin, included an eight-page cut-off section to serve as a shaky paper.
The stores initially did not want to impose restrictions, according to reports from ABC Australia on March 3 where they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, soap to wash hands with flour.
Also, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening, the British online store Ocado appeared to reduce the purchase of Andres's sheets to 12 paper towels.
The World Health Organization has confirmed the spread of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak — the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 — a major pandemic.
Although the term "massive epidemic" refers to how widespread the disease is, not how dangerous a specific case is, the World Health Organization observed the importance of encouraging nations to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this great pandemic.
If countries recognize, test, cure, isolate, monitor and mobilize their populations in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
We are deeply concerned by the rates of transmission and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "exactly unprecedented."
He said, in a comment published by CNN in February, "but with flu, no respiratory virus was monitored from spread to global spread."
Ghebreyesus said: "We have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus before."
He continued, "We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
A new situation such as the pandemic follows the World Health Organization's decision in January to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak of the disease, "basic, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, the U.S. Broadcasting Corporation reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it was announced that the Global Public Health Emergency Situation Concern on 30 January 2020, and identified as a major pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have died.
Death rates are estimated to be 4% in China, while internationally vary from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Problems may include pulmonary artery and COPD.
The time from infection to the appearance of symptoms is usually around five days, but it may be between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is to treat symptoms of illness and ancillary therapy. The recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering your mouth as you cough, maintaining distance with other people, and monitoring and self-isolation in people who suspect they are infected.
Organisations around the world have taken action by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantines, curfews, dangerous restrictions at work, and the closure of buildings.
This pandemic has led to severe social and economic unrest, the postponement or disruption of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and the spread of shortages of goods due to the purchase of goods in fear.
Schools and universities are closed on a global or regional basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Lying about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of discrimination from other countries and discrimination against China, some people from East and South-East Asia or having the same look, and others from areas with the majority of the virus cases.
Following reduced transport and closure of large industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health organizations Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported cases of a non-sourced lung strain known on 31 January 2019, and an investigation was launched as early as January 2020.
The cases were related to the Huanan Seafood Market and thus the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new virus discovered and related to the coronavirus of bats, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The first person to be identified with the symptoms was diagnosed with the disease on 1 December 2019, and the person had no visible relationship with anyone in the market.
In the previous events observed in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be connected to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post said that there was a case followed until 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei province, it could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that, how new cases reportedly decreased in China but exceeded Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be serious cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, at least a few cases have been reported in young people, those aged 19 and down to 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the UK's population would need to be infected before effective immunity could be achieved through vaccination.
Visa means the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their dose is confirmed to be positive according to the official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country has measured more than 3% of the population, and many countries have officially not tested those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infections for 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical study published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the production base number (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it could be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not receive, the time from the appearance of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, normal day numbers being 14.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were associated with COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, as much as 80% of deaths were in those over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic generally means people who died were tested and positive for COVID according to the official protocol.
The number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Only some data from Italy found that the additional death toll in the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention admitted "We are aware that [the cited death toll] is a low estimate", a statement confirmed by the reports of poor counting in the United States. A low estimate often occurs in the pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first outside of Asia was France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by location and time, influenced by the level of testing, the quality of the health care system, the type of treatment, the time of the first occurrence, and the demographic status of people such as age, gender, and general health status.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) by April 10, 2020.
The number varies depending on location.
In China, mortality rates decreased from 17.3% (in people with symptoms starting from 1st to 10th January 2020) to 0.7% (in people with symptoms starting from 1st February 2020). Other tests include the death rate for each case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from the disease, the rate of death from infection (IFR), which accounts for the percentage of people who have not been diagnosed (measured and who have not been tested) who die from the disease.
This data is not limited to a temporary criterion and follows a specific number of people from the transmission event to the resolution of the case.
A number of scholars have tried to calculate these numbers in a specific population.
The University of Oxford's Evidence-Based Medicine Center estimates that mortality rates due to the pandemic are between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher this percentage corresponds to the results from the random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and statistical analysis to examine the impact of CFR testing on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) claims that this pandemic can be controlled.
The height and time of the disease outbreak is unknown and may differ from location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "Unfollowed, the infection usually develops and then begins to decline when the disease becomes infectious.
But it's hard to estimate or estimate when that time is."
China's top adviser Zhong Nanshan said it would "probably stop by June" if all countries could be encouraged to follow the World Health Organization's advice for measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, the London Institute of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to spread, there is a possibility of a year or two".
According to an investigation by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, maintaining distance with people and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (there is a possibility of 18 months or more").
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is so easily transmitted—will disappear completely" and could "be seasonal disease, occurring every year".
The severity of the infection depends on the level of the virus.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may not be specific and infected people may not show any symptoms.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Unusual symptoms include fatigue, the delivery of cough, loss of breathing sensation, muscle and joints, sore throat, headache, cold feeling, vomiting, coughing blood, running, or skin having a blue color. The World Health Organization says that approximately one in six people get very sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists emergency symptoms such as acute respiratory failure, persistent chest pain or gallbladder, sudden anxiety, difficulty walking, facial or blue lips; urgent treatment is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected individuals may not show any symptoms, but their results confirm that they have been infected, so researchers have advised that those who have been in contact with people who have been confirmed should be monitored and examined to remove fear of infection.
The Chinese estimate the dose range of people who do not show symptoms ranging from a few to 44%.
The normal period of symptoms (the period between exposure and appearance of symptoms) ranges from one day to 14 days; usually five days. For example, the percentage of people with COVID-19 lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Other details about how the disease is transmitted are still being investigated.
The disease is believed to be transmitted primarily when being close to the droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking; with a person approaching 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without an oral covering can allow droplets to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that this virus can also be transmitted to the remaining small droplets in the air for a long time, potentially from the moment of conversation.Respiration drops can also come from breathing time, as well as during speaking, but this virus is generally not transmitted through air.
These drops can reach the lips or noses of people close to or pulled to the lungs.
Other medical procedures such as ventilators and cardiac and lung animation (CPR) can cause respiratory fluids to be drained into the air and thus distributed through the air.
It can also be transmitted when a person touches a part containing the virus, including the skin, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are doubts that it can be spread by feces, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government objected to the possibility of spreading from feces to the mouth of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is widely transmitted three days after the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to transmit it before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease for up to three days before the appearance of symptoms shows that it is possible to spread before most symptoms occur.
There are only a few confirmed cases in the laboratory of people who do not have any symptoms yet they have the virus, but cases of infected and undiagnosed people have been identified by other countries while monitoring people who have been in contact with patients.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not fully clear how the disease spreads, one person generally infects two or three more people.The virus has the potential to remain active in different places for hours to days.
Specifically, these viruses were found to be able to be detected for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel impregnated 304, for one day on cardboard, and up to four hours per copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature levels. Favorite animals and other animals have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but British authorities suggest washing their hands after touching animals, as after touching parts of infected people they may have touched.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first identified by three people with acute respiratory pneumonia in Wuhan.
The symptoms of the virus SARS-CoV-2 occur in related coronaviruses around the world. Outside the human body, this virus is killed by home-use soap, breaking the surrounding flower.SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be an infection from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus binds to the coronavirus gene Beta, in the subspecies of the Sarbe virus (generation B) as well as two species from bats.
It is 96% identical in the amount of particles to other samples of the coronavirus in bats (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, the Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in a certain part of the particle mechanism between the virus from pangolins and from humans.
All particle comparisons so far have found for the maximum 92% of particulate matter found in pangolin coronaviruses seen by SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove to you that the central parasite organism.
The transmission of this virus may be temporaryly diagnosed based on symptoms, but the evidence is ultimately based on a method of chemical replication and a series of reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected fluids or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan has suggested that CTs are significantly better than PCR, although not specific, with its imaging features interfering with other pulmonary artery and disease procedures.
As of March 2020, the American Academy of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to filter or as a first-time testing method to identify COVID-19".
WHO has published multiple protocols to test SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with the first post being released on 17 January.
The test uses a reverse chemical particle with a series reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be done with respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally achieved within hours to a few days.
This test is generally carried out using cotton inside the nose although taking samples in the mouth can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing a blood-focused test, which detects antibodies in the body.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be genuinely approved for use by many.
The U.S. blood test is designed and Cellex is approved for emergency use by only authorized laboratories.
The characteristics of radiology images and computer imaging (CT) of people who are infected include a partial low pressure lung and a lack of fluid concentration between the chest wall and the lungs.
The Italian Radiological Association collects an online database of the results of medical images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as adenovirus, providing a picture without proving through PCR has a shortage of specific issues in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT and PCR breast imaging results and showed that although clinical images are not specific to the infection, they are faster and better, demonstrating their adherence as a filtering device in epidemic areas.
Online apps created by a non-native mind are designed to detect the clinical features of viruses and medical images and CTs.
Disease prevention strategies include maintaining personal hygiene in general, washing hands, preventing keeping your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in tissue and putting dirty tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who may have been infected are now advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Measures to maintain distance are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have imposed restrictions or advised against any non-essential travel to and from countries and territories affected by the outbreak.
However, this virus has reached a stage of social spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within communities and some community members don't know where or how they got infected. Medical providers who have treated someone who may be infected are recommended to use common precautions, contact tracing and eye protection. Tracking contact tracing is an important way for the health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by the government for this use has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations making an announcement calling for limits to such surveillance.
Different mobile apps have been implemented or recommended for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than twelve groups of experts were creating privacy-protecting solutions, such as using Bluetooth to send user distance to other mobile phones.
Users then receive messages if they have been close to anyone who has been tested and diagnosed with COVID-19.The lie spreads about how to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and suction and mouthwash combinations are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop one.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if your hands appear dirty; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, this virus is killed by home-use soap, which blows its protection foam.
The CDC further recommends using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol in moderation when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people not to wash their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The active ingredients can be purified by killing the virus using different chemicals (in one minute of chemical use for a fraction containing stainless steel), including 62-7% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5%povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as Benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, have not been very successful.
The CDC recommends that if the case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in buildings such as offices or schools to take care of children, in all places such as offices, bathrooms, living rooms, electronic devices such as flat computers, toys, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by sick people, they should be cleaned with disinfectants.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their lips and nose with a folded elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and throw away any tissue at once.
A medical mask is recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can control the amount and distance of travel to respiratory droplets distributed when you speak, sneezing, and coughing.
Who gave instructions on when and how to use the mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viral scientist at the University of Leeds, "The wearing of a mask can reduce people's ability to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."The masks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of anyone who may have this disease.
WHO recommends wearing a mask with healthy people only if they are at risk, such as those taking care of someone with COVID-19, although they have also admitted that wearing a mask can help people touch their faces.
Several countries have started to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical mask but made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of a medical mask that can be discarded by healthy public people, especially when approaching (1 feet (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask using public transport or staying in places where there are many people.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make masks using home linens and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a face mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face covering while going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government ordered everyone to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks every day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and city buses to wear face masks on the 1st of March.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face covering every time you go out, while also recommending the manufacture of a face covering at home for those who cannot afford to buy a face mask.
Baroas have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Staying away from society (also known as people's incompatibility) includes measures to control transmission intended to reduce the transmission of disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include; travel restrictions; school closures, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas, or shops.
People can follow methods of staying away from the community by staying at home, reducing the journey, not going to a crowded place, greeting each other without contact, and maintaining distance with other people.
Many governments have now ordered or recommended not to interact with people in areas affected by the outbreak.
The size of the proposed population collection by U.S. government agencies and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no COVID-19 infection in a particular area) to 50 people, and later up to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and the affected body's immune system pose a significant risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as often as possible in the context of a community outbreak. Towards the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to change the term "not interacting with people" and "maintain distance", clarifying that the goal is to limit direct contact while maintaining social relationships, whether online or remotely.
The use of the term "stay away from society" has led to the assumption that people should engage in social distancing fully, rather than encouraging them to continue to interact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have provided sexual health guidelines to use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations only to have sex with someone you live with, who has no virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions to self-isolate at home in a way that is appropriate.Many governments have prescribed or recommended quarantine for people living in affected areas.
Severe restrictions on self-quarantine have been imposed on those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have had a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with a high supply chain are advised to quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Strategies in the control of disease outbreaks are to prevent increased or suppression, and to avoid.
Control is being administered in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as bring other measures to control infection and vaccination to stop the disease spreading to other people.
If it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are then transferred in the prevention phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and avoid its effects on the health and social care system.
The combination of preventive measures to increase and avoid can be done together.
Suppression requires hard action to reverse a major catastrophe by reducing the production base number to less than 1.The part of dealing with an infectious disease is trying to reduce the peak of an outbreak, known as the balancing of a pandemic outbreak.
This reduces the risk of overwhelmed health care and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical measures that can control this outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand washing, face masks and quarantines; community measures aimed at staying away from communities such as schools closed and closed by mass gatherings in public; community affiliations to encourage acceptance and participation in such strategies; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning up places.
Several countries have also implemented measures to reduce the spread of the virus.
South Korea launched a public testing and quarantine of sites, and issued a travel alert for infected people.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected and quarantined themselves and imposed heavy penalties on those who did not do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and fined for possessing medical products.
Effective prevention policies can reduce the demand for medical services during the outbreak by 2/3 and half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression is preferred but needs to be maintained at all times as the virus spreads in the population (or until a vaccine is first available), or it does not reappear quickly when the action is relaxed.
Long-term disaster suppression strategies lead to social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug for COVID-19, but the effort to manufacture it continues, including testing for existing drugs.
Using medications purchased without a prescription, drinking water, and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, additional air therapy, drip, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of muscle-building drugs can lead to results.
Several chemicals that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also mentioned that "some local and home remedies" may provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Raising space and changing health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients is defined by the WHO as the primary step to addressing the outbreak of the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have provided hospital and primary health care guidelines to focus resources at a number of levels, including directing laboratory services for testing COVID-19, cancelling planned procedures as much as possible, staying away from isolated patients with COVID-19, and increasing the capacity for high-quality care services by training staff and increasing the number of ventilators and beds.
There are many theories about where the first case (known as the first patient) might have occurred.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.

In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic slowdown due to this pandemic on global growth could surpass that which was caused by the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
Some estimates from a specialist from the University of Washington in St. Louis provided a $300+ billion impact on global supply chain that would last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly been "soured" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a low demand from China.
Global markets slowed trading on 24 February due to a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to rising concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, the majority of US stock exchange tests including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded the most significant declines since 2008, with Dow dropping 1,191 points, the highest per day since the 2007-08 tough economic situation.
All three indexes closed in less than 10% per week.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH emphasized the country's debt repayment rate, but maintained poor visibility.
The sale of goods was halted again due to fears of the coronavirus, with 16 March seen a sharper drop.
Many people think that there is a possibility of economic collapse.
The economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken at the right time by the central bank and the government.
Central banks are dealing more quickly than they dealt with during the 2008 financial meltdown.
Tourism is one of the sectors affected by travel restrictions, the closure of public places including travel destinations, and the government's travel advisory against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, with the UK's regional carrier Flybe crashing.
The impact on the luxury fleet industry was at an unprecedented rate.
Multiple train stations and ferry ports are also closed.
This pandemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Most of the events involving many people were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's Eve concert, with private companies also closing their own shops with tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Chinese New Year's events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including Forbidden City Beijing and traditional temple displays.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and territories, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, ordering multiple workplaces not to open until that day.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong increased the response to infectious diseases to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shutting schools down until March and canceling New Year's Eve celebrations.The retail business sector has been affected internationally, with reduced working hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in trips to major stores in March compared to February.
Major supermarket operators around the world put in more measures, such as increasing hygiene, setting up temperature assessment gadgets to measure the temperature of buyers, and canceling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, a slowdown in the wake of the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people in extreme Latin America than would have been in that situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when the pandemic hit more than Wuhan, approximately 5 million people lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million displaced workers have been stranded at home in the country's provinces or detained in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak is likely to result in the dismissal of 47 million people in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Union Reserve Bank of St. Lois. The temporary closure of operations in India has caused millions of workers to migrate to India (paid through daily income) without work. A study from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian homes were affected by a different type of unemployment. About 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown began temporarily in mid-March 2020.
In the second phase of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal loan scheme. Nearly half a million German companies have sent their workers into a government-funded short-term work program known as Kurzarbeit.
Germany's short-term work programme has also been used by France and the UK.
The performance and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by this pandemic, having affected the functioning of organizations as well as individuals—employed and employed—internationally.
Organizations in the arts and cultural sectors tried to endorse their (usually publicly funded) goal to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, around the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, theatres, and other cultural institutions were temporarily closed and their exhibitions, events and performances canceled or postponed.
In response there was a lot of effort to provide alternative services via online platforms.An other recent event is rapidly growing because of this disease is canceled religious worship, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festival and exhibitions, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also suffered a stir. The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which is the last week of the Christian season, has been canceled.
Several dioceses have recommended older Christians stay at home but not taking part in Sunday Mass; some churches have made church services available via radio, live streaming online or television while others have a church service to come by car.
Following the Roman Catholic Dioceses closing their churches and small churches with the Basilica of St. Peter's with no Christian pilgrims, other religious organizations also canceled their worship and control gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and temples later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of pilgrims and citizens to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the biggest disruptions in the world's sports calendar since World War II.
Many sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 European UEFA NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
This outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the Games would be "scheduled until another date after 2020 but not more than the summer of 2021".
This has led many gamblers to online, with many online gambling sites reporting an increase in the number of registers.The entertainment industry has also been affected, with many music groups suspending or canceling exhibition trips.
Many sports venues, such as Broadway, have also stopped dramas.
Some artists have tried to continue creating and distributing work through the Internet as an alternative to live performances, such as live performances online or creating an online "festival" of artists to perform people, distribute, and promote their work.
Many of the jokes containing the coronavirus content have spread online, with many people turning to humour and debauchery even in the face of adversity.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the growing senseless hatred of people from other countries, racism has been seen in people from China or Central Asia, and against people from the most affected parts of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially Europe, Central Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (where many cases were still in China only) have seen racist sentiments being directed at different groups in the Chinese world to qualify for the virus or receive what is said to be an appropriate punishment.
Other African countries have seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
The majority of Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination based on their origin.
There has been support for Chinese, online and offline, and for those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the continuation of this outbreak in other countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience the worst COVID-19 outbreak, would also be subjected to suspicion and intimidation against foreigners. Citizens in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had previously signed a petition seeking to prevent Chinese people from entering their country in an effort to prevent the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went viral on Twitter.
Chinese people and other Asians in Britain and the United States have reported high levels of racial violence, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has been criticised for referring to the coronavirus as "China virus", a statement considered by critics as racist and racist.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian men and foreigners who were rescued from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which uses one border with China and studies in India's major cities, have been reported to have been subjected to violence related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, mentioned that the Chinese had destroyed natural resources and "that's why God decided to avenge them."
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese embassy in Kolkata, calling them "mistakes" in China, discrimination of people from other countries and racism against non-Chinese populations increased following this pandemic, with foreigners being called "foreign waste" and targeted for "casting".
Many newspapers with subscriptions have removed it for some or all of the information about the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have written scientific papers related to outbreaks to be available and free access capabilities.
Some scientists have decided to rapidly distribute their results into automated servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 related viruses including methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced to fight the infection.
The presence of the virus on a viral sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA protein of the coronavirus.
This dosage is specific and designed to detect the RNA protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus alone.
It is used to confirm the most recent or ongoing infection.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used in diagnostics as well as monitoring people.
Antibodies tests show the number of people diagnosed with the disease including those whose symptoms were very low reported or those who did not show any symptoms.
The precise mortality rate caused by this disease and the level of complex immunity among people can be determined from this dose.
Due to low testing rates, by March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the spread of the virus among their populations.
As of 23 March, no country had measured more than 3% of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This difference also has the potential to significantly affect the death rate, which is highly likely to be overestimated in some countries.
Using a real-time (rRT-PCR) dosage can be made on a sample of asthma obtained in a variety of ways, including a sample of nasal products or a sample of cough.
Results are generally achieved within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed using throat samples is expected only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can be lost in the throat as it continues to breed in the lungs.
For infected individuals measured in the second week, alternative sampling materials can be taken from the depths of the respiratory tract through a body fluid or cough (cough) device can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests was created in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a real-time (rRT-PCR) test, and became the basis for 250,000 packages distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also created a measure by 23 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech, created a package to detect SARS-CoV-2-based PCR-based treatment status (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the National Management of Medical Products in China for a SARS-CoV-2 detection package based on PCR. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is supplying its Real-time PCR Screening Panel of the New Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health contractors through the International Drug Testing Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in previous versions of testing packages resulted in an unfavourable deviation from faulty testing instruments, and the complexity of testing at the CDC facility in Atlanta; this resulted in an average number of less than 100 samples being tested successfully throughout the course of February 2020.
Tests using blocks were not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, it was up to this point that national and local radars were allowed to operate tests.
The measure was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Authorization Act.The U.S. commercial laboratories began conducting tests in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the presence of a COVID-19 test in a nation using RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made tests for COVID-19 available as of March 9, 2020.
There are no limits to advertised standards; the collection and processing of samples must be carried out according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, a COVID-19 test was created and produced by the National Centre for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the dose was registered with the Federal Medical Monitoring Service.On 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic reportedly developed a COVID-19 diagnostic test.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a dose that would be carried out within 3.5 hours for maximum volume, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for the Abbott M2000 system measurement; the FDA had previously given the same approval to Hollogic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the same EUA approval from the FDA for a dose that lasts approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a measure that uses nuclear acid production technology based on a solid temperature measure rather than a PCR.
Because this dosage does not require a series of alternating temperatures, this technique can deliver positive results in a short time of five minutes with negative results in a span of 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott is hoping to ramp up production to produce 50,000 tests per day. A test using the identical nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the belief that they will deliver results within 15 to 20 minutes just like flu tests.
A review of an article in March 2020 concluded that "the chest tests are of lower investigative value in the initial phase, while the CT results [images of body parts shown by computers] may exist even before the appearance of symptoms."
Common features in CT include glass containing two multi-layered lines that block light with a curved, non-linear and backlighting ratio.
Subpleural presence in abundance, poor way and consolidation develops the disease continues to grow.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan during the outbreak of the current pandemic has suggested that CTs are significantly better than PCR, although not specific to its many image components interacting with other pneumonias and disease procedures.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to carry out the screening or the first phase of COVID-19 screening tests".As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR to be used in pre-screening.
Part of the body's immunity to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infections within people starting from 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to identify the immune system, and to monitor people.Tests can be performed on medium-sized (CLT) or by testing in the care areas (PoCT).
Automatic body screening systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the level of production of each system.
For one peripheral blood sample is used, although chronic samples can be used to monitor the immune response of the body.
In PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained from the absorption of the skin.
In contrast to PCR methods the take-over measures are not required prior to the trial.On March 26, 2020, the FDA released 29 names that provided information to the agency needed and thus are currently able to supply their own antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their packages tests, potentially detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in a blood sample.
The testing capacity is hundreds of samples within an hour and is therefore much faster than the standard PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of the infection.As early as April, the UK found that no dose package of the antibody it purchased to be the best used.
Hong Kong has put in place a program in which people suspected of being sick can stay at home, "emergency department will give the patient a sample bottle", he will spit in it, restore it and get the test results over time.The UK NHS has announced that it is testing suspected patients at home, removing the risk of a patient infecting others coming to the hospital or having to kill the embryos in ambulance if used by the patient.
Vehicle passing centres have helped South Korea carry out some of the fastest and most effective tests in any country.In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors said on 2 March, that it had an average of about 12,000 daily tests in the ambulance arrangement and 10.700 had been tested last week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when the dose is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, traffic tests were carried out in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, because only the affected results were reported.
The first laboratory study showed that as of 12/2020 a total of 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12 weeks/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were found to contain SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a sampling method from 64 patients at the same time, by putting together samples and further testing if a sample combination is found to have been affected. In Wuhan the laboratory for emergency detection of a time of 2000 square meters called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) opened on February 5th 2020 with BGI, and can detect 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction being managed by BGI founder Wang Jian and completed in 5 days, estimates have shown the case in Hubei would be 47% more and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled if this level of testing had not been established.
The Wuhan lab is quickly followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily probability was 50,000 tests per day. Different designs available free of charge by Origami Assays have been released and are able to test the sample of 1122 patients of COVID19 using only 93 tests. These standardized designs can be used in small laboratories without requiring the use of robots to process water.
By March, shortages and poor standards of testing tools have been a challenge for both the EU and the UK and the United States.
This led the publishers to explore sample preparation procedures involving heat samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to leave the RNA genome for further tests.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more people for the virus than any other country, and was steadily increasing testing levels to reach the highest number of people.
This was through the integration of people's capacity to serve and the purchase of large scale masks from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection masks in China).
Built within 14 days, the drone has the capacity to carry out thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first in the world with such capabilities as this one to be used outside of China.
Various testing criteria aimed at various components of the coronavirus genera were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization began to use Germany's replica of producing packages sent to low-income nations to create their own.
The German response was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, and delays in existing tests in the U.S. and China and the U.S. had problems with the efficacy of testing kits at the start of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide adequate equipment in line with the requirements and recommendations of testing by health experts.
In comparison, experts say that access to testing in many parts of South Korea helped slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to measure, largely in the private sector, was built over a long period of time by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the roll-out of testing programmes as a way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, a high demand for testing packages due to the spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States, and there was a shortage in the supply of test chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported problems in the accuracy of testing packages.
In the United States, the testing packages created by the CDC had "a deficit;" the government then lifted restrictions that prevented personal testing.The Spanish purchased testing packages from China's Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results of the tests were not accurate.
The agency explained that such incorrect results may be due to a lack of collecting samples or using packages appropriately.
The Spanish ministry said that it would remove packages that restored incorrect results, and would use packages provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy instead.80% of the testing packages that the Czech Republic purchased from China yielded incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be thrown into the Danube River.Ateş Kara from the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the testing packages that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and "did not use it."The UK bought 3.5 million packages from China but in early April 2020 announced that they could not be used.
Testing, followed by the quarantine of those tested and diagnosed with the disease and monitored in those with SARS-CoV-2, occurred in the results of the infection.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the region's first case of death from COVID-19 in Italy, ran two phases of testing for the entire population of 3,400, approximately in a 10-day range.
Nearly half of the people diagnosed with the disease did not have any symptoms and all of the diagnosed cases were quarantined.
While the road was closed, it was completely destroyed.
With an ambitious plan to track people in touch, local travel restrictions, testing and quarantines, the coronavirus pandemic 2020 in Singapore has spread more slowly than other developed countries, but without even more stringent restrictions such as forcing the closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Most of the events were cancelled and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in due course after the holiday period on March 23.
Many other countries have also curbed the pandemic with an ambitious plan to monitor contactable people, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with a lower level of lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Studies have shown that countries that have more measured, compared to the number of deaths, have lower rates of severe cases, probably due to their better ability to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with low-impact COVID-19 testing and national antivirals send the first five cases of COVID-19-free and the first ten samples in one of the WHO's 16 COVID-related laboratories for verification testing.
Of the 16 species, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the following chart, a vertical line of "A case of disease like % of tests" is stimulated by a testing policy.
A country that tests people admitted to hospital alone will have the highest number of cases of the disease as % of all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors being the same.
Washing hands (or washing hands), also known as hand hygiene, is an act of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, dirt, germs or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap regularly during "some critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the channels of stool to reach the mouth.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. liquid-containing membranes).
Five important times during the day when hand washing with soap is necessary include: before and after going to the bathroom, after cleaning the baby's toilet or changing it, before giving the child food, before eating and before and after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be washed with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after treatment.
After a change of pace or cleaning up a child who has gone missing.
When it comes to cleaning, cleaning, or cleaning.
After taking the animal, the animal's food, or animal's feces.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene activities related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before giving medication or treatment can prevent or slow the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from viruses (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens) and chemicals that can cause harm or illness.
This is especially important for people who are dealing with food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes for driving; reducing infectious diseases;
Reducing infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices could lead to a minor improvement in the height of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and driving can be prevented by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple act can reduce the mortality rate due to these diseases by almost 50%.
Strategies that encourage people to wash their hands can reduce driving periods by about a third, and this can be compared to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of the decrease in driving periods can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is one of the most cost-effective ways to prevent driving and respiratory infections (ARI), such as routine behavior followed at home, at school and in communities around the world.
pneumonia is the number one cause of death of children under the age of five, killing 1.8 million children each year.
Driving with pneumonia together contributes to around 3.5 million children's deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, doing hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet as a habit can save more lives than any other vaccine or therapeutic strategy, reducing mortality from nearly half-acting and deaths from asthma infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other cleaning strategies such as water, hygiene and hygiene programs (OSHA).
Hand washing also prevents skin rash disease that is transmitted through direct contact with the body.
A small side effect of hand washing is that hand washing can always lead to damage to the skin due to dryness of the disease.
A 2012 study in Denmark showed that excessive hand washing could lead to an end-to-end condition known to urinate of the hands or skin diseases of the hands, especially among medical staff.
Hand washing is also often seen as one of the most common symptoms of COPD.
There are five important times a day when hand washing with soap is necessary to reduce the spread of diseases from stool to mouth: after using the toilet (going for a small need, going out to a large need), after cleaning the fire (change his diaper), before giving him food, before eating and before/after preparing food or touching raw meat, fish or bird feed.
Other cases where the correct hand-washing technique should be done to prevent the spread of the disease include before and after treating the wound; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal debris or touching them; after touching the waste.
In many countries, there is a low level of hand washing with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households were washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States at the center of nearly 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. Several methods of changing behavior exist at the moment to increase hand washing habits for soap in these dangerous times. Hand washing for school children in the hours of the day coordinated is one of the most effective methods in developing countries to teach and remind children to have the habit of washing their hands.
The "Basic Health Care Program" implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is a high-profile example of promoting children's health and education.
Killing worms twice a year, supplemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national project.
It has also been successful in Indonesia.
The removal of germs from the skin is facilitated by adding a soap or water-soluble spray.
The key act of soap and strong medication is to reduce the mixture's restrictions, and to increase solubility.
Water alone is not able to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning, however, is supported by the presence of good flow of water.
Solid soap, due to its re-use nature, can keep bacteria obtained from previous use.
A limited number of studies that have dealt with the distribution of bacteria from contaminated soap have concluded that the transmission is not easy because the bacteria are washed and removed through the form.
The CDC says that "hand-controlled water soap in its bath is recommended".
Bacterial soaps have been widely advertised for the public who care about health.
To date, there is no evidence that using pre-prescribed antiseptics or parasitic killers designate non-drug-resistant organisms in nature.
However, bacteria-killing soaps contain common anti-bacterial products such as triclosan, which has a long list of types of immortal microorganisms.
Therefore, even if the non-dead species are not given soap against bacteria, they may not work effectively as advertised.
In addition to skin-protecting medicine, complex mixtures can contain acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, fermented milk) as a pH stabilizer, anti-benzoic acid and other skin lubricants (aloe vera, vitamins, mentha, drugs from trees). The University of Oregon School of Public Health's analysis showed that conventional soaps are just as effective as those of anti-microbial users in preventing diseases and removing bacteria in the hands.
Hot water that is right to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow more quickly in the body's temperature (37°C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than soapy cold water in removing natural oils that hold sand and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using lukewarm water has no effect on the reduction of cell waste in the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-water spray for cleaning hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand-washing liquid with waterproof alcohol (also known as alcohol-containing agents, antiseptics or hand sanitizers) became popular.
Most contain isopropyl or ethanol alcohol mixed with weight-lifting ingredients such as Carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) and fat-reducing, or a moist supplement such as making glycerin a liquid, or foam to be used quickly and reduce the dry effects of alcohol.
The addition of dissolved hydrogen peroxide enhances anti-inflammatory activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effective in disinfecting bacteria.
Alcohol-based antibiotics kill bacteria, non-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, hepatitis, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic acid supplements with 70% kill 99.97% (3.5-loga reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after use. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hand sanitizers containing almost norovirus (or Norwalk), which are the most common causes of gastroenteritis infection, should be used appropriately to put hands on or cover all hands.
The front and back of both hands and center and the ends of the fingers are all rubbed for at least 30 seconds until liquid, foam or flower drying.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend washing hands rather than using turns, especially when the hands are obviously dirty.
The increase in the use of these secretions is due to the ease of its use and the rapid killing of the parasite, however, they should not be used as an alternative way to wash hands unless soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcohol-containing agents may cause skin dryness unless the ingredients of the amino acids and/or the ingredients of the skin have been added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on skin drying may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other amino acids to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-containing agents of the embolism resulted in lower levels of irritation and skin dryness compared to other antibiotics.
Allergic problems associated with skin contact, skin irritation or problems with alcohol or ingredients in alcohol-containing agents did not occur much.
The ability to cause skin irritation turned out to be an attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite its usefulness, non-water products do not clean the hands from organic materials, but they kill the microorganisms to them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of bacteria because such bacteria are still in the hands.
The effectiveness of a non-alcoholic yarn depends largely on its ingredients and particles, and historically has not done well compared to those with alcohol.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a consistent and holistic activity against germs after they have been used, compared to alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in its effectiveness after being used over time, probably due to persistent skin problems.
Many people from low-income communities cannot afford soap prices and use ash or sand instead.
An ash or sand can be more suitable than water alone but can not be more effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash contains microorganisms, it can further spread the disease rather than slowing its spread.
Just like soap, ash is also a disinfectant product because it is mixed with water, forming an alkaline mixture.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative soap product when soap is not available.
The methods of hand washing in the appropriate way proposed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of the spread of the disease include the following steps:
Use lukewarm water to wash hands or cold water.
Flow water is recommended because the static basin can be contaminated, although the water temperature seems to be different.
Rub the hands with an adequate amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the toes and even under the hips.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people have a tendency to wash their hands better than water alone.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Swelling causes friction, which helps to remove microorganisms from the skin and rub for longer periods of time to remove even more microorganisms.
Take good care of water.
Washing your hands can cause damage to your hands again.
Wash the water with clean towels or allow it to dry in the air.
Hands that have fluids and moisture can be easily germinated again. The areas that are often forgotten are thumb, wrist clench, areas in the middle of the toes and under the palms.
Artificial nails and paint paints the nails.
Skin oil is often recommended to help hands get out; dry skin can lead to damage to the skin that can lead to increased risk of infection.
Low-cost options can be developed to facilitate hand washing in the place of canal water and/or soap is not available for example to pour water from the lyre with appropriate holes and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In cases where there is not enough water (such as schools and residential areas in developing countries), there are water storage solutions, such as "care canals" and other low-cost options.
Hanging canal is a simple technology that uses a rope-mounted jag and a foot-operated gadget to pour less water into the hand and into the soap of a piece.
Hand washing is an essential part of the hand washing process, but the debate continues about the most effective ways of hand washing in public wash areas.
A large growing study suggests that paper towels are a cleaner way than hand dryers that are in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was carried out by the University of Westminster, London, and funded by the paper towels industry, to compare the sanitary standards provided by paper towels, dry-handed air movement and the latest jet-air air drying hands.
After washing and drying hands using a hand dryer for air movement, the total number of bacteria was found to increase averagely on the fingers by 19% in the hands by 254%.
Drying hands with a jet-air cooker resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands to tissue, the total number of bacteria decreased on the fingers by up to 76% and by up to 77%.The scientists also conducted experiments to determine whether there was a potential contamination of users of other bathrooms and bathroom environments due to all kinds of hand drying techniques.
The drying machine, providing unit air at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to spray the embryos from the hands and the unit with the possibility of polluting other users of the bathroom and bathroom environment up to 2 meters.
The use of an air-conditioning device transmits nuclei up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the machine.
In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying techniques were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying hands have been observed:
There are many manufacturers of hand-washing products, and these hand drying products are compared against using tissue.
Washing hands with liquid hand tissue is an alternative when traveling with no soap and water.
The hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became a necessity long after a specialist from Hungary, Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices used to respond to reminders of hospital staff washing their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates due to its use.
Washing hands is recommended to be for 15 seconds medically, using an adequate amount of soap and water or oil to rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be tied together with the hands.
If there is dirt under the nails, a soft brush can be used to remove it.
Because the microbes can remain in the water in hand, it is important to properly rinse and dry hands with clean towels.
After cleaning, these tissues should be used to close the water (and open any external door if needed).
This prevents the spread of the virus again.
The purpose of hand-washing in the health care sector is to remove the germs ("germs") and prevent them from spreading them.
The New England Journal reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in many medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients and disinfecting them.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of blood flow related to caesarean section by 66.The World Health Organization published a table showing common ways to wash and rub hands in the medical sectors.
The organization's hands-on cleaning guide can also be found at the organization's website for public comment.
The investigation was carried out by Whitby and other writers.
Commercial equipment can test and verify the cleanliness of the hands, if required.
The World Health Organization has "five times" to wash hands:
In the presence of blood and/or fluids
before the introduction of bacteria, and
after caring for the patient. The addition of bacteria-killing chemicals to soap (a "drug-resistant" or "with antibiotics") enables the product used to wash hands to kill the bacteria.
Such an act of killing bacteria may be required before surgery or in a scenario where antibiotics and antibiotics are present in abundance. To 'swift' your hands with surgery, it is necessary to have a canal that can be opened and closed without touching hands, the amount of chlorine or iodine, the cleaned towels of the hands after washing, and the rub-in brush and other fermented disinfecting device.
All names should be given.
This process requires washing hands with a hand brush up to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Length of time (10 minutes) is not required.
When you're selling, what's in the handbox should be stopped from falling back and coming back to the hand.
After the washing of the hands is completed, the hands are rinsed with a disinfected cloth and surgical gown to be worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands or use a bacterium before and after treatment.
With the control of bacterial infections in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand washing occurred in the first 20% of washing, and that the lowest benefit was achieved when the hand washing rate was increased more than 35%.
The washing of soap alone results in a three-fold greater distribution of the rate of bacterial infection spread of food as compared to washing with a chemical antibiotic. Compared to rubbing hands with alcohol-based mixtures and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, it showed that rubbing hands with alcohol reduced bacterial infections by 26% than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rub mixtures for reducing H1N1 influenza virus A and Clostridium difficile particles from the hands. Strategies for improving hand hygiene in the healthcare landscape may involve staff education about hand washing, increasing the availability of hand-washing mixtures containing alcohol, and written and spoken reminders for employees.
There is a need for further research in which of these strategies are effective in different healthcare themes.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a low-cost, essential tool for good health, and even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water, handwashing facilities or soaps in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge in fulfilling the global habit of hand washing.
For example, many of our rural Africa's hand-washing areas in almost every private or public toilet are few, even though affordable ways exist to build hand washing facilities.
However, lower levels of hand washing can also be the result of habit of getting used to it but not due to the absence of soap or water.
The development and advocacy of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in people's behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is essential.
A systematic study of 70 studies found that approaches involving communities are effective in increasing hand washing in LMC, with community-based campaigns encouraging to change behavior at a lower rate. One example of hand washing promotion in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Technique" that encourages schools to take simple, low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When low levels are met, schools can move from one star to the last three stars.
Hand washing stations can be part of the hand washing promotion campaigns that are being developed to reduce disease and mortality in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a awareness-raising campaign trying to bring about a change in behaviour. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF improved the use of handwashing emoji.
A small number of studies have focused on the cost-effective overall hand washing in developing countries in relation to DALY dosage.
However, one study suggests that encouraging hand washing with soap is much more cost-effective than other water and hygiene strategies.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in dangerous conditions such as mothers who have given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first discovered in the middle of the 19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: a doctor from Hungary named Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Australia and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time many people still believed that the infection was caused by a bad smell known as miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks caused by foodborne illness related to healthcare led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fully develop hand hygiene as a key way to prevent the spread of the infection.
The outbreak of influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing using soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, banners labeled "right hand washing techniques" were written around hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of offices and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing your hands from" a matter, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to join others in a wrong or moral matter.
It comes from the biblical passage in Matthew where Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used passage in some British communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Macbeth's daughter begins to wash her hands in a fervor to try to clean up the perceived stain, symbolizing her guilty conscience about the crime she committed and convincing her husband to commit.
It has also been discovered that people, after remembering or meditating on immoral practices, appear to wash their hands more than others, and seem to appreciate more hand washing equipment.
Additionally, those who are allowed to wash their hands after considering such things have a lower chance of getting involved in other acts of compensating for "cleansing", such as volunteering.
The religion mandates washing hands for reasons of purity and as a sign. Washing hands as a sign, washing hands with soap and water, is part of the ritual of washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam demand the washing of hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandates washing hands before and after every meal.
The Dangers of COVID-19
Risk controls at work are the use of safety methods at work and health risk control in preventing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at work correspond to the workplace and the work being carried out, following a risk assessment of the risk of exposure, the rate of disease in the community, and the risk factors for employees who may be exposed to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk workplaces rarely interact with the public and other workers, and basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging staff to stay at home including sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine hygiene and hygiene for the workplace medicine.
Average exposure jobs include those in need of regular contact or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but are likely to be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who interact with the general public such as at school, a multi-population work theme, and several large-scale retail businesses.
Risk controls for this group, beyond the basic measures to prevent transmission, include ventilation using a high-quality air filter, sneeze barriers, and having self-defense equipment available if someone with COVID-19 is found.
OSHA considers health workers and mortuary staff at risk by people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at greater risk of exposure, which is even more likely if employees perform aerosol-containing procedure in, or collect and process specimens, known or suspected from someone with COVID-19.
Control of the appropriate hazards these employees include engineering controls such as rooms with low air and environment, and self-defense equipment suitable for the work to be carried out.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have a lot of consequences in the workplace.
Workers may be out of work due to illness, need to take care of others, or fear of being at risk.
Business models may change, in the type of products required, and ways of acquiring those products (such as buying products at times when there are not many people or through delivery or via a vehicle service).
Finally, shipments of goods from COVID-19-affected areas can be interrupted. Preparation plans and response to the infectious disease can be used to guide protection measures.
Plans address risk levels related to different workplaces and tasks, including risk factors, risk factors from home and community areas, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also list appropriate controls to deal with such risks, and emergency plans for situations that may arise following the outbreak.
Preparation of infectious diseases and response plans may follow recommendations of a particular nation or region.
The response objectives for the outbreak include reducing supply among workers, protecting people who are most vulnerable to chronic medical problems, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other organizations and involved in transporting goods.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the response taken.
A risk management system is a system widely used in workplace safety and health to put in groups risk management based on effectiveness.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be put to an end, the most appropriate controls are engineering, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately self-defense equipment.
Engineering controls involve excluding employees from work-related risks without relying on staff behavior, and can be a cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is a change in work policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less of a result than engineering and governance controls, but may prevent some instances of vulnerability.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the risk to the employee, and properly worn (e.g., ventilators), always with proper wear, periodic inspection, maintenance, and replacement, as required, and properly removed, cleaned, and disposed of to prevent transmission.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), fewer exposure jobs are connected to people at work and to the public and other workers.
The basic measures to prevent transmission of all work themes include hand washing and comfortable, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, breathing etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and garbage bins, preparing for work from home or working on relaxed turns as needed, advising workers to use other equipment, and maintaining coordination cleaning and cleaning of work theme spray.
Fast detection and isolation of people who are thought to be infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with chronic respiratory symptoms should stay home until they do not have fever, fever symptoms, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antiretroviral medications or to deal with symptoms, and that the disease holiday policies change depending on the condition, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a family member who is sick, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, the risk factors include those that require regular contact with people or close to people within six feet (1.8 meters) who are unknown or suspected of COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing social distribution around the business area, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to an area with a high spread of COVID-19.
This includes employees who interact with the general public such as in schools, crowded work environments, and other crowded retail areas.Engineering controls for this and other high-risk business areas include keeping high-quality air filters, increasing ventilation standards, setting up controls such as smart sedentary barriers, and setting up a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this and other vulnerable group include encouraging patients to stay at home, changing face-to-face meetings and communication channels, setting up emergency communications plans including a platform to respond to staff questions, providing education and training on COVID-19 risk situations and self-defense, teaching employees who need to use clothing and equipment to promote personal hygiene, hand-washing, reducing the face-to-to-to-to-face masking, and other measures, and labeling, and labeling signs about hand washing, and other COVID-19 measures, and keeping up an averages may be required to protect the workplace.
It is rare for workers in this dangerous group to need to use a ventilator.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, the best stability to protect staff and other passengers includes isolation of the patient and others at a distance of 6 feet, choosing one flight attendant to handle the patient, and giving the patient a face mask or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose and tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Flight crews should wear medical gloves that you can throw at sick passengers or touch body fluids or places that may have been infected, and possibly more personal protective equipment if a sick passenger has fever, coughs too much, or difficulty breathing.
Glavu and other tools thrown away after use should not be thrown into special hospital garbage disposal bags, and infected parts should be diluted and cleaned with medicine afterwards.For shipping, including luxury ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include suspending trips if you are ill, and disinfecting and informing a health facility in the container immediately if one has a temperature or other symptoms when in the container.
Suitable, medical monitoring to be carried out in a separate person's room.For schools and buildings to protect children, the CDC recommends temporary closure of the drug if the infected person has been in the building at school regardless of social distribution.
While there are fewer to moderate social distributions, incompatibility techniques can be implemented such as cancelling educational trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as sports or choir training sessions or meals in restaurants, increasing the space between desks, relaxing times of arrival and departure, reducing the number of unwanted guests, and using a separate health office area for children who have symptoms such as influenza.
When there is a serious infection in society, by speaking of strategies for non-compliance, further closure of schools can be considered. For law enforcement workers who work on daily activities, the existing risk is considered to be lower by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact people who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, as well as real protective equipment.
If there will be close contact when taken, workers should clean up and clean up their tape and work equipment before using it again using a home cleaning sprinkler or sprayer, and follow routine procedures for working with PPE casting and dyeing and dyeing.
OSHA considers other staff and staff of the mortuary to be at high risk or in high risk category of infection.
High-risk jobs include the provision of health care, support, laboratories, medical transport workers who have been in contact with known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These functions are highly at risk of infection if employees are implementing procedures to produce aerosols, or to collect or process samples from well-known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The procedures for producing aerosols include inserting the tuber into the esophagus, broncoscopy, some procedures with dental examination, or collection of samples for injecting,
The high-risk functions of the mortuary infection include staff involved in the preparation of bodies of individuals known or suspected to contain COVID-19 at the time of their death; these are high-risk functions if they carry out a morbidity investigation. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol production procedures are carried out.
A special air-conditioning positive impulse reaction may be effective in some health care settings and mortuary rooms.
Samples should be handled with the attention of Level 3 Bio-Safety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in exceptional waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19, in addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends ventilators for those working around 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those implementing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 surface ventilators prescribed by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive written plan of the respiratory system that includes, testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of ventilators can provide greater protection and improve employee comfort. WHO recommends the ovaries, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for the doctor in the entry area.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples starting from caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol-producing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, sunglasses, face shield, gowns, and gloves.
If aerosol production procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the international availability of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting PPE requirements through the electronic transfer of medical information, physical barriers such as light windows, to allow those involved only in direct care to enter the COVID-19 patient's room, using only PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the ventilator aid machine without replacing it with a number of patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and not encouraging the use of masks for people with symptoms.

Title: [Covid-19] Relaxing the load and preparing the future
Deadline: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
C.C.C.: There is no right to privacy
We are in a special situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is something that makes it clear our close global relationship and the responsibility we have for ourselves.
We don't have the first place for its challenges, but we don't know that our best answers depend on the kind of emotional-partnership in the world, the partnership, and the social fabric that is at the heart of this organization.
The trust and friendship and care we have among all our partners via email, phone, and chat is the exclusive justification for the wonderful human beings we are lucky enough to work with.
I am so grateful and grateful for all of you.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
He reminded me of the importance of being able to use Wikipedia right now, and the main symbol is for this valuable resource to remain online and accessible to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether it's to keep the facilities working or our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
It's not just what we do, but how we do it, it's what makes the world a better place.
Because of the importance of this mission and your work for him, we will be making some important adjustments to how we work together, starting this week.
Changes to our work and schedule
As mentioned earlier, the team c met last night to discuss the route and our schedule for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we focused on what we thought would be the right answer to what we are going through and the best way to develop an organization at this time.
We all wanted to get rid of stress and support our long-term mission.
If you want to call us, that's right.
For employees, contractors, and all employees of the contract:
Our daily work expectations will be around 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until an indefinite period of time.
We don't advertise holidays - if you can work for more regular hours, our missions can send you.
However, this world cannot be predicted right now, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, get groceries, or go to a doctor, your interests are our priority.
We don't follow your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should be clear, but we say it.
There are no sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and support your team through the calendar and schedule to ensure the main areas of work are addressed.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please tell Bryana at T&C Ops to find out so that T&C can help you with support and ensure your situation can be properly considered by management).
Employees who work full-time will be paid.
We have already said, and we are committed again to respecting our commitments to our contractors and our employees working for hours.
Each person will be paid on the basis of their normal hours of work during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use it as a way to deal with their stress and our world.
What we are doing can be very exciting, especially at this time.
Again, this involves taking care of yourself.
What we ask is that we contact our manager, so that we know what we should expect and we can fix it.
Other tasks are considered important.
There are some things we must continue to do.
SRE teams, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising (among other teams) perform important tasks that may require additional support.
We will start the process with all departments so that we can assess the current objectives and be able to focus on supporting what is important to our mission.
There are a lot of things to do for all of us, we will all focus on the most important goals.
It will not hurt, but it will not hurt later.
We do not plan to go "for more time" as soon as the pandemic passes.
You are not expected to work overtime to reach an agreement that is currently not possible.
We believe that things have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as much as possible.
What's happening with the app (the annual subscription)?
In order to adjust to our new reality and the prospect of working hours each day, we aim to revise the timing of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan submission.
Our goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to plan a budget to allow our staff to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for their loved ones while providing for those in need or wanting to work for a limited period of the next few weeks.
The addition of this time greatly reduces the current planning and pressure functions throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the members and the team about the following steps as soon as possible as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your guidance in this regard.
Office conditions, infections, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues at SF may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, with great caution, we employed well-prepared cleaning workers to clean up all areas in the office of San Francisco.
They used a virus-killing solution used in hospitals to clean up everywhere, even in the courtyards and stairs that reach our floor.
This building uses its own maintenance function to use products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel very well that the office will be well prepared at the time when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in DC.
Until last week, our DC office transferred its functions to be carried out remotely according to the instructions shared by San Francisco.
According to some of our colleagues at NYC, we have also been discussing setting up an area in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but may be delayed.
Some of them are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely know that it can be a difficult situation to adapt to, and they wanted to give some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to an hour or two.
If there is a need for long sessions, consider how they can be separated over a period of several days.
Describe the meeting clearly, have a agenda, and send early material to read.
Make the video a default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate integration and direct connection.
Have a leader to facilitate each meeting, a person to monitor the chat for questions and to track the list of speakers, and someone to help write the citations (or collaborate in writing quotations).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a good headset.
Use your skills to make money.
Join the #remoties center in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team adheres to a network environment guide to assist in the increase of distributed tasks in the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel all Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO announces the pandemic is over.
We informed them that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it difficult to complete their agreed grant activities and that no one will be punished for delaying or modifying those targets.
This week we're going to be following the additional guidelines on Wikimania and other regional and community topics.
General opinion from global communities seems to be a source of sadness for the inconvenience but a comfort in the openness and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT works to keep a page about Meta-Wiki in order to provide an opportunity for the community to monitor the results and monitor our communication with them.
Keeping in touch on COVID-19 related issues
We will be sending an invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will take this time to share some additional updates, answer your questions and take the time to connect with each other.
We are here to help as much as we can.
For now, you can continue to search for information from this email, and all other relevant information related to COVID-19, on Office Week.
The CRT will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also committed to maintaining regular contact with employees living in countries that have been severely affected at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, events, major tasks, or access challenges, or anything else that you may need help with, please do not hesitate to inform and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide the support and cooperation needed.
If you have a privacy issue or are sensitive, please send an email to Bryanm Judan - Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as the abandonment of your duties and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a recognition that at this time, our work and responsibilities are likely to change in a way that we have not seen before.
These are the steps we believe are important in supporting each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the needed support, and the world's most reliable services.
Our work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
Now is the time to support and create a space for important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to do that, and so we need you to protect yourself and our families so that you can be in a better position when the need arises.
Take your hands off and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The 2 enzyme b'Angiotensin (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer part (the cell membrane) of the cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 reacts to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity by reducing angiotensin-II levels and increasing Ang (1-7) by making it a good medicine to treat heart diseases. ACE2 is also used as a entry point to certain coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hace2.
Angiotensin reverse enzyme 2 is a zinc containing the enzyme of the metal atoms located in the area of the last cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 domain of the terminal N peptide and the domain of transporting the amino acid of the colotic terminal C
ACE2 is a one-way membrane protein I, its active digestive domain being at the top of the cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The ACE2 external fluid domain holds the membrane domain to another enzyme known as a sheddase, and the resulting protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually released through urine.
ACE2 is found in many ingredients: ACE2 is attached to the membrane of the alveola type II lung cells, small intestines, veins and terminal venous cells and fine muscle cells in many organs.
The ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the brain's membrane, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain system.
The main function of ACE2 is to work as an ACE partitioner.
ACE activates the hormone I of angiotensin in angiotensin II of blood pressure.
On its side ACE2 activates carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and breaks into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also inhibit several connections including [des-Arg9]-brandykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls the transmission of the natural carrier membrane SLC6A19 and is referred to as Hartnup disease.
As a membrane pass protein, ACE2 is used as the main entry point for certain coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the synergy of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 protein to the ACE2 enzyme domain at the upper part of the cell causes endocytosis and viral and enzyme transfer to the internal endostoms of the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the protein S and the main TMPRSS2 protein block, a block that is currently being investigated as a possible treatment. This has led some to assume that reducing ACE2 levels, in cells, can help deal with the infection.
However, many professional and managerial organizations have recommended continuing with the standard ACE inhibitor and ARB treatment.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2013, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34 percent greater deficiency in the risk of pneumonia compared to regulators."
Additionally, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also combined with a reduction in mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Human-integrated ACE2 (rhACE2) has been considered a new treatment for severe lung injuries, and appeared to improve blood circulation and oxygen saturation in young pigs with severe acute acute respiratory syndrome of lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and will start working after 30 minutes as well as the result (time) 24 hours.
Several results suggest that rhACE2 may be a good drug for those unable to tolerate system renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where angiotensin II circulating is preferred. A combination of rhACE2 is rated in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic respiratory disorders.
The COVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to help people who have been linked to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the process of identifying people who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many programs were developed or proposed, with official government support in several districts and areas.
A number of software development programs have been developed.
Privacy issues have been highlighted, especially regarding systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of the software users.
Highly customizable alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to set the user's approximate location to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would connect the Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has released a program that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a software called TraceTogether is used.
The program was developed by the community and the local IY, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-based program for finding infected people who can transmit and provide immediate responses to health care authorities.
The program was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was pending approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the search for connected people was in the advanced stages of development, and it will be operational within a few weeks. The simultaneous program is planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand focus on software based on Singapore's TraceTogether software and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to introduce a program based on the area of patients likely to have COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of practical problems of software systems, including positive misconceptions and possible ineffectiveness if the use of software is restricted to a limited number of people.
To address problems regarding the distribution of "coronavirus" programs misleading or malicious, Apple imposes restrictions on what types of organizations may place coronavirus-related programs in its App Store, restricting them to only "official" ones or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also implemented the same restrictions.
Privacy campaigners expressed concern about the impact of large numbers of people's surveillance using the coronavirus software, particularly about whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus disease will be dismantled after the disease is controlled.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement saying restrictions on such investigations have been imposed.
The Commission has identified four areas in the government's budget:
must be "valid, useful, and appropriate";
Monitoring and monitoring must be carried out in a timely manner;
The use of data has to be restricted for the purposes of COVID-19.
data security and anonymity must be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid further discrimination and exclusion;
must share all data with third parties defined by law;
There must be protection against harassment and the right of citizens to abuse violence;
The meaningful participation of "all key stakeholders" is required, including for public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Compute Club of Germany (CCC) and Reporters Without Barriers (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also provided a checklist of audits.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to address the problem of continuous investigation by removing the search mechanism from their device's operating system after it is no longer needed.
Some countries used internet-based monitoring instead of apps, eliminating the need to download apps and capabilities and avoiding searching.
In Israel, internet-based surveillance was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to real location data have potentially significant privacy problems.
However, not all major server systems require access to personal location data; several privacy handling systems are designed that use the main server only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-programmed system was used to search for connected people.
Instead of using a single software, the system collected search information from various sources including mobile device search data and card transaction data, and included these to report via text messages to potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to inform potential people, the government has also made local information accessible to the public, something permitted due to changes in the privacy law of the information after the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Several countries including Germany focused on using central and private storage systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not been released.
The search for connected people whose privacy is well established, with a large group established in the past 2013. Up until 7 April 2020, several professional groups were working on private solutions that are easy to use, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to set up a user-friendly location for other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that has all the means of jurisdiction and jurisdiction, and not a single protocol. Various authoritative protocols include Search for a Near Place whose Privacy Is Stored with Multiple Authority (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, Fka Event Contact Numbers, cen), Sensitive Privacy Protocols and Phone Tracking Techniques (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, the personally identifiable data does not come from the device, and all the synchronization takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy storage techniques when collecting and using location or data to track COVID-19 infections.
Based on a study from the whitepaper "Programs Have Become Lagai: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Explosion" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform for Enigma MPC, a private technology-promoting company that was also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April, the TCN Global Partnership was established by groups that were associated with the same techniques and protocols, with the aim of reducing divisions, and facilitating international cooperation of search and notification programs, an important component of achieving greater use.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government program.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS platforms, announced a plan to search for connected people, which claimed to be privacy-protectors, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy storage encryption.
They also published a classification of the underlying technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be delivered in three steps:
provide tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus search apps that protect privacy
The connection to this functionality directly in iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple's plan to address ongoing diagnostic problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in a similar way after the threat ends.
Drug replacement (also known as taking other medications, repositioning, leading to new work or changing medications) is sending other approved medications for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition rather than using it for a previously developed cause.
This is one of the scientific research methods that is currently being pursued to promote safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and taking the immune system of a person who recovered and transferred it to a person who was sick through blood. SARS-CoV-2 contains around 66 drug proteins, each of which has multiple locations with molecules.
Analyzing these link areas provides a good project to develop a better antiviral drug that will produce COVID-19 proteins.
The most targeted SARS-CoV-2 protein is a protease such as papain, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A, who examined several of the prescribed drugs, then improved and analyzed their similarity to the bones and high-level approved drugs to speed up the development of possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and his proposed drug investigation into the clinical surveillance structure.

The CDC said that "the use, dose of the drug, and duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when "there is no other option",
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study of the use of chloroquine as well as zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
A major study is underway at Duke University and Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School conducts safety and efficacy trials for the use of hydroxychloroquine.
Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that fapiravir was "effective"
The 35 patients in Shenzhen were tested and the results were negative in an average of 4 days, whereas the length of the disease was 11 days for 45 patients who did not receive the drug.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given fapivir and half were given umifenovir.

It may not be safe to use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antibodies, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from producing copies in comparison to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change the drug to find an atom that will connect with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about pointing to the changing resources of drugs created to treat HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Union's experiment.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and coronaviruses.
One issue with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to severe disease and infection.
Some early remdesivir studies show that it can be a serious genetic barrier. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate illness and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for intravenous passes in hospitalized people and they are seriously ill with COVID-19; two controlled embryos (China, Canada) and one uncontrollable (Italy).
New York State began the trial of azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.

Also tests in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a design vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are several ongoing trials to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be found in less than 18 months.
The five vaccines selected were in the safety study of Phase I in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, resulting in significant investment and research activities to develop vaccines.
Many organizations are using printed genomes to develop potential vaccines to prevent SARS-CoV-2.
As mentioned in April, the CEPI program requirements for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale consumption, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development at the beginning of 2020 to create a viable vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
The main objectives of the forum developed in the field of security research include:
particle cell acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I promoter and designated vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
virus surveillance tools (Phase I developer and designated vaccine: CanSino Biology, type 5 vector adenovirus.
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 selected vaccines are being developed in early stages, with 78 being confirmed as ongoing projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but with few publicly available details (presumed to be planned or created).
Phase II trials run an initial safety test with immunogenicity, usually not following a specific procedure, are controlled through a placebo and in various locations, noting more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the highest doses.
Of the 79 selected vaccines being developed (certified at the beginning of April), 79 were not evaluated in humans (still in the study "before clinical testing").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is conducting a feasibility study of a genetically modified metabolic molecule that can convert viral proteins to stimulate the immune system.

At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million to fund 96 medical testing projects against COVID-19, including a number of vaccines designated in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicaid and the University of Saskatchewan.
Meanwhile, the Canadian government announced $192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine alone, with plans to introduce a national "vaccination bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVac, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA produced small doses of SARS-CoV-2 S1 induced a potent antigen-specific antibody response [within mice] that appeared to be an idea starting 2 weeks after the vaccine."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Medicine announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine as a possible nasal spray spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be synthesized from the inside copy of the human bacteria to produce particles such as non-harmful viruses, which can stimulate the immune system to provide antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three U.S. universities provided access to supercomputers from IBM, as well as computer resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can be more beneficial than the disease that prevents them.
More randomized trials in Australia are looking to hire 4,170 healthcare workers.
The vaccines developed may not be safe or will not produce the desired results.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using specific animal COVID-19 models, such as ACE2 with genes from mice, other lab animals, and other non-human particles, highlights the need for 3-degree prevention measures for infectious particles, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and SARS have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SARS that has been shown to be safe and to exploit the expected outcomes in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and growth of new vaccines and medicines for treating SARS was a priority for governments and public health organizations around the world.
When MARS began to spread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infections.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and the other three continue, both of which are virus-prevention vaccines, two DNA viruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
The intellectual property rights mentioned by various social media posts refer to existing genetic rights and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and breathing problems.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat ulcers, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
From the time of infection to symptoms appear it is usually around five days but may start on the second or fourteenth day.
While a large number of cases cause severe symptoms, some develop a viral pneumonia or a few active ingredients.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly among people close to each other, often through small droplets provided when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although these drops are produced when you breathe out, they tend to fall on the floor or on surfaces rather than infect each other at a distance of a meter.
People can also be infected by touching the infected area and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can live in areas up to 72 hours.
It is more transmissible in the first three days after symptoms appear, although its spread is possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. A common method of detecting the transmissibility of the polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) from the particles provided in the nose.
People who suspect having the virus and their caregivers are advised to use the mask.
Public proposals in general to wear masks vary, with some authorities recommending their use, some recommending them to be used, and others calling on people to use them.
Currently, there is no vaccine or special treatment to prevent the COVID-19 virus.
Infections have been reported in many countries in all six regions of the WHO.
People infected with the virus may be mistaken for symptoms or show flu symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and respiratory problems.
Emergency symptoms include breathing problems, pain or persistent pressure on the chest, confusion, difficulty walking, and face or mouth blue; it is recommended to seek medical attention if these symptoms are present.
Unusual; symptoms in the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, sneezing or throat pain can be seen.
Symptoms in the stomach such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea have been seen in different percentages.
Other cases in China showed only chest and heart palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can continue to be pneumonia, various organs do not work and death.
This is known as a period of mourning.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from a second or fourteenth.
97.5 percent of people who show symptoms will show up within 11.5 days after exposure. The report shows that not all infected will show symptoms.
The role of these repeaters in the infection is not yet fully known, however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the transmission of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who show no symptoms at the moment and are under investigation, with the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20 percent of all confirmed cases continued to show no symptoms in hospitals.
China's National Health Commission began to include people who showed no symptoms in their daily cases on 1 April; 166 people infected on that day, 130 (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Fluoride and saliva can have high levels of the virus,
The sound of the voice is louder than normal speech.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering can cause droplets to up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted into the air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that it is possible to transmit via airborne particles and airborne collectors in the channels outside people's rooms had positive samples of RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures such as turning back and recovery of heart and lungs (CPR) can cause respiratory fluids to be turned into air and thus cause spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that it can be spread through stools, this risk is believed to be low. The virus can be highly contagious when people show symptoms; although infection is possible before symptoms appear, its risk is minimal.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says although it is unclear how the disease spreads, one person generally infects two or three others.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaning spray are also effective if used properly; soap products weaken the protective layer of the viral oil, dilute its strength, as well as provide it to the skin and other areas.
Other moisture, such as Benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical chemical), does not work properly. In a study in Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken for an average of two days after they began to be hospitalized.
Among the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe respiratory syndrome, the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of severe respiratory problems,
All variants of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus appear in the coronavirus-related virus naturally.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a home-based sabnae, which bursts into its immune tract. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to natural SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19 because the virus reaches the cells containing the virus through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found predominantly in the second alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses specific areas glycoprotein known as "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cells.
A severe heart attack was found in 12 percent of people infected and admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is most common in severe disease.
Heart disease symptoms are high, because of the inflammatory response system and immune system during the development of the disease, but severe heart wall injury can also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are very visible in the heart and are responsible for heart function.
Most cases of coronary heart disease (31%) and blood clotting (25 percent) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with serious prognosis. A case study of people who died from COVID-19 has found specific mutations due to the disease (DAD), with transmissible lymphatic cells in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV 2 has a growth of ACE-2 showing cells that stretch your body's surfaces in the respiratory system, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemichyinflammation symptoms.
In particular, T cells derived from GM-CSF embryos showed up in harmony with the monocytes that produce the IL-6 of tumors and cause severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Rare skin disease has also been reported during blood tests.
WHO has published a number of protocols for the study of the disease.
The most common method of testing is in a research laboratory to detect the availability of genes (rRT-PCR).
The analysis is usually done on breath samples obtained by a sample of a nasal clinic; however; a sample of the cough and saliva can also be used.
Results are generally achieved in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they need two blood samples that took two weeks apart and the results are of little value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the stress of the coronavirus by a series of genes so that laboratories around the world could develop tests to produce various copies of specific DNA samples to detect the virus.
As of April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and if an individual had previously been infected) were ongoing but not widely used.
China's testing experience has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first clinical trial on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of the month. The diagnostic guidelines provided by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommended methods of diagnosis based on clinical characteristics and risk of epidemics.
Two soft glass and multi-metal with side parts used to detect asthma ropes,
Subpleural presence in abundance, poor channels (the thickness associated with lobular and different alveolas load), and connectivity may appear to be an ongoing disease.
A few data are available about small lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological results of the morbidity test are:
Optical observations: pleurisy, pericarditis, the lungs filled with liquid instead of air and a concentration of water in tissues and lungs air spaces.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation consisting of lymphocytic infiltration and large cell structure.
Severe pneumonia: a specific change in the lungs due to an illness (DAD) with liquid from the lungs.
DAD is caused by acute acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hyposemia.
Recovery of pneumonia: the delivery of fluid in the gaps of gums and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: major problems where the proteins that control the blood clot are becoming more active (DIC);
Prevention measures to reduce exposure include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing hands with soap and water regularly for at least 20 seconds, exercising with good hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose by using tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using it inside the elbow if no tissue is available.
Clean hands after coughing or sneezing are encouraged.
The CDC has recommended using face coverings in public settings, to prevent infection from a person showing symptoms. Community separation strategies aim to reduce compatibility with infected people in large groups by closing schools and workplaces; preventing travel and banning large public gatherings.
The guidelines for staying away from people also include people staying away for at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
Although no vaccine is expected until 2021 as soon as possible, a key part of COVID-19 control is trying to reduce the rate of outbreaks, known as "reducing infection."
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating and after blowing, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol to kill germs, but it is when soap and water are not available. In areas where hand sanitizers containing disinfectants are not readily available, WHO provides an internal production formula.
In these structures, the activity of antimicrobial is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help get rid of bacteria in alcohol; it is not "something that is used for hand sanitizers"
Glyserol is added as a substance used to keep things moist.
People are controlled by care, which can include using liquids such as treatment, oxygen support, and treating other affected organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect that they have this virus wear a regular mask.
An external ventilator (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory problems, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Cleanliness of the body and having a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet has been suggested to improve immunity.
The treatment can be used in those showing mild symptoms at the beginning of the infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for taking care of people admitted to hospital because of COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and lung doctors have included treatment recommendations from various agencies to be a free resource, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some experts recommended paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen to be the first option to use.
Caution should be taken in order to reduce viral infections, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that can produce aerosols, such as putting the tubes or passing the air to the patient using hands.
For health care professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping an individual in the Airborne Infections Unit (AIIR) as well as using routine precautions, the precautions of people who have been in contact with airborne infections.The CDC provides guidance on how to use the PPE Protective Equipment during a major pandemic.
The recommended clothing is: PPE gown, respirator or mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, respirators (rather than masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved them for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but their effectiveness against specific biological particles is not guaranteed for undefined use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face coverings, or as a final, home-made mask.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require ventilation installations or replacements, but are required for a high percentage of cases.
The type of breathing assistant for people with respiratory problems related to COVID-19 is being studied in people in hospitals, with some evidence that tubing can be avoided with a high-intensity ventilation device.
It is not known if one of these two causes the same benefits for people who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer to use ventilation installations when available because this technique reduces the humidity particles compared to the ventilation device at a higher rate. Severe cases are common in older people (those over 60 years old, and especially those over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have adequate beds for everyone, which reduces the health system's ability to handle sudden COVID-19 events that are too severe to require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5 per cent were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed ventilators and 1.4 per cent died.
In China, about 30 percent of people admitted to hospital because of COVID-19, were eventually admitted to a critical room.
It becomes more difficult to use ventilation as severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs with COVID-19 and is becoming more and more difficult to increase oxygen.
Air-conditioning instruments that control pressure and high PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery and still reduce the risk of lung injury associated with the air passing instrument
The upper PEPE may not be available in old air compressors.
Possible medical research began in January 2010, and several antiviral drugs are under clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to have good results.
Although new drugs may be introduced in 2021, several drugs that are tested have already been approved for other uses or are further tested.
Antiviral drugs can be used by people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers to participate in effective trials and possible medical safety. The FDA has given temporary authorization to distribute antibodies as experimental treatments in cases where the person's life has been severely threatened or immediately.
There has been no clinical research to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect "the person you have been in close contact with" by sending observational data and thus be able to detect possible risks and get infected.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If possible risks have been identified, the app not only does not promote self-isolation, but also informs local health officials. Large data analytics, facial recognition technology, mobile phone monitoring and machine awareness are used to track people infected with it in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people believed to have coronavirus.
The move was taken to ensure isolation and protect those who could interact with infected civilians.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared total phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to conduct research and prevent the virus from spreading.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to detect violators of quarantine laws.
Giulio Gallara, Italy's health commissioner, said he had been informed by mobile phone service providers that "40% of people continue to walk alone".
The German government hosted an event to develop computer programs with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonia's president, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called for innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress in quarantine, travel restrictions, medical side effects or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connoe as saying, "Increased isolation from people, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic depression is an effective approach to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have few or no symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as influenza.
Severe disease usually heals within two weeks, where people with severe or critical disease may take three or six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of being infected with COVID-19 based on data compared to other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but COVID-19 data is missing. For some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can quickly become a chronic respiratory disease (ARDS) that causes complete failure to fully test, or a variety of organ infections unable to function.
COVID-19-related complications include bacterial disease, abnormal blood clotting, heart, kidney and liver damage.
Unusual clotting, especially the prolongation of prothrombin, is described in 6 percent of those hospitalized due to COVID-19, where abnormal renal function is seen in 4 percent of this group.
About 20-30 percent of people with COVID-19 show severe liver dysfunction (high levels of liver damage)
According to the report, the average time between symptoms seen and death was ten days, and five days spent in hospital.
However, patients who were transferred to the intensive care unit had an average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early diagnosis, the average time to show symptoms of early death was 14 days, and the total duration of six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a death rate of 2.8 percent, while women had a death rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathology tests of post-mortem pulmonary samples show some changes in the structure of the lungs and severe respiratory disease in all lungs.
Significant changes in cells were also observed in the cells of the gums.
A lung image is similar to a severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage was observed by increased levels of troponin or heart attack.
According to March data from the United States, 89 percent of those admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions. Access to medical and socio-economic resources of the region could also affect the state of being able to die.
Estimates of deaths due to this situation vary due to those regional differences, but also because of the problems of specific methods.
The low number of cases can result in an overestimated death rate.
However, the fact that death is the result of previously infected people can mean that the current mortality rate has been ignored.
Smokers were more likely to have symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require special treatment or death compared to non-smokers. Questions were raised about how long the disease would be.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found that the rate fell to 20 to 30 percent in the lung capacity in people who recovered from the disease, lung tests showed organ damage.
This can also lead to health problems that remain after severe disease recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the previous infection provided effective and long-term protection within those who recovered from the disease.
Prevention seems like a possibility, according to the behavior of other coronaviruses, but there are reports of cases in which people have recovered from COVID-19 and have been accompanied by positive coronavirus tests in the future.
These cases are believed to be increasing with long-term infections rather than new infections.
The virus is thought to be natural and comes from animals, through transmission.
The cause is unknown but as of December 2019, the infection was spread from one person to another.
A study of the first 41 COVID-19 cases confirmed, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, showed the first date on which the symptoms began is 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported that the first symptoms appear to have been on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to measure the death rate.
These numbers vary depending on the region and time and are affected by the number of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the first outbreak occurred and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO handed over the ICD-10 emergency disease codes, U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were confirmed in the patient and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths that were medically or quantitatively measured without SARS-CoV-2 infection, to the lab. The mortality ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases measured within a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll is 6.9 percent (153,822/2,240.191) until 17 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the region. Other measures include the death rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people diagnosed who die due to illness, and the death rate for infection (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (identified and undiagnosed) people who die because of the disease.
This data is not limited by time and follows a certain number of people from infections to the case resolution.
Although not all infected people get antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide a description of the number of people who have been infected.
At the epicenter of the explosion in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7 percent) people have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread at the Carnival celebrations, and spread to young people, causing countless deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be officially recorded in the same way.
The German health system has failed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.0004% of the population) have been confirmed dead due to COVID-19.
The effects of this disease and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
In research conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher for men.
The biggest risk is for men aged 50 years and older, with the gap between men and women approaching at only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender disparity are unknown, but genetic and behavior factors may be factors.
Gender-related immunodeficiency differences, the rate of women smoking falling and men having more than one disease such as high blood pressure at a young age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of people infected were men and 72 percent of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track data related to the gender of COVID-19 infection.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect different men and women.
A large percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that CO represents coronavirus, VI for the virus, D for the disease and 19 is the first year in which the outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic area (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, according to international recommendations regarding the designation aimed at preventing stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the coronavirus of fatal asthma 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus that causes COVID-19" in public communication.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly known as the "coronavirus" and the " Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended that severe 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV respiratory disorders as provisional names for the virus and the disease in line with a 2015 guidance opposing the use of sites such as disease names and viruses,
Official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-12 were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to potential restrictions in the supply chain, some digital manufacturers are publishing health care equipment such as nose cleaners and air-conditioning parts.
In one example, when the Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilation tube, and the seller could not deliver in a timely manner, the domestic supplier developed and printed 100 tubes needed for one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, false theories, false information and lack of information emerged regarding the origin, scale, immunity, treatment and other tools of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus recurrence in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been found to treat the disease.
The global study of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being developed by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "Union Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing anti-viral drugs with a strong commitment to effectiveness.
There are no vaccines available, but various organizations promote a variety of vaccines.
The initial works of SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three types of testing.
First, the researchers aim to create a vaccine for all viruses.
The use of this virus, whether active or dead, aims to increase the human body's immune system's effect on new COVID-19 infections.
The second technique, part of the vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system feel certain parts of the virus.
In the event of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third technique is the vaccine for cell acid DNA (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method of making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these methods will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with 4 volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a non-harmful genetic code copied from the disease. An antibody-based improvement has been proposed as a potential challenge for the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials that are active going on as of April 2020.
Seven trials were assessing the already-confirmed treatment for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The revised antiviral drugs include a lot of China's research, with phase III trials in several countries due to the report before the end of April.
A complex review of clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines continues, starting in April 2020. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir as well as interferon beta.
There is evidence of remdesivir effectiveness, starting in March 2020.
Clinical advances were seen in patients treated with remdesivir use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was initially used to treat malaria was researched in China in February 2020, using preliminary results.
However, there is a call for review of the researchers.
The Korean and Chinese health authorities recommended the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that using double doses is extremely dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19.
Initial data shows high doses of ribavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in a glass container.
Nitazaxonide has been recommended for more vivo research after showing a low-density inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Research has shown that increased protein preparation using transmembrane protase serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the introduction of SARS-CpV-2 through contact with ACE2 receptors.
A study on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine whether or not they contain azithromycin has a significant deficiency that has prevented medical professionals from embracing this treatment without further research being conducted. Oseltamvir prevents SARS-CoV-2 in fertilization and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The presence of Cytokine protein in abundance can lead to a complex situation in the future levels of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-inflammatory properties exceeding the amount of cytokines. Tocilizumab is included in the instructions for the treatment of the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
It is going through phase 2 of randomized trials at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Mixed with a blood test of a fertilised serum to identify an increase in cynic volume, it is intended to counteract such results, which are considered to be the leading cause of death among infected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA because of a subsequent study of the treatment of increased cytokines caused by different factors, car cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no systematic, controlled evidence that tocimizumab is the best treatment for CRS.
The transfer of printed and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to people in need is being investigated as an inactive form of non-vaccinated body immunity.
This method was tested on SARS with incomplete results.
The synchronisation of the virus is the expected path to action in which the ineffective treatment of antibodies can bring protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other methods, such as cell-based phagocytosis and/or antibodies-based phagocytosis, are possible.
Other non-invasive methods of treatment of the body, for example, using synthetic antibodies of the same type are formed.
The production of a recovery medicine vaccine, consisting of a fraction of the blood liquid from recovered patients and has antibodies that are specific to the virus, can be increased due to its rapid development.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan General Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after educating the public about the spread of the virus.
