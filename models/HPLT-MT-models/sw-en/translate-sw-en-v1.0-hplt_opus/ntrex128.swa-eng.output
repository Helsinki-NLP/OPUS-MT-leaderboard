Members of the House of Commons are concerned about the "appearance"
There are concerns among some delegates after the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This led to a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Council from all political parties are concerned that such a move will lead to ridicule.
A member of Labour said his group was concerned that the name "matched with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In the Welsh tww means fool and pwp means feces.
Plaid's wing member said the group was generally "unsatisfied" and suggested an alternative name.
The Conservative member said his group was "clear in mind" about the change in name, but said it was the wording of the MWP-to-Craft acronym.
In this context, the letter w is pronounced the same as the letter u in the English of Yorkshire.
The Council's panel, which is currently creating legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision regarding any keyword related to how members of the Council are referred will certainly be of the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act of 2017 granted the Wales Council the authority to change its name.
In June, the Panel published the results of consultations with the public about proposals that were broadly supported by reference to a council such as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the Council Members' position, the Panel favored Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the option of the MWP received further support in consultations with the public.
As it turns out, Council members recommend alternative options, but reaching an agreement can be challenging for the Administrator, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The changes will include other changes regarding how the council operates, including legislation to remove the eligibility of the Council member and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the Council will vote on the last name when they are discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote for a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was planned to resolve a conflict that has been in place for a decade with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Authorities in Athens insist that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim to their territory and has continued to oppose its bid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of a direct referendum on changing the name, said he would ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that a change of name is needed in order to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells go silent as churches in Harlem go through challenges
Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a church and a bar at every corner," Mr Adams said.
Today, there is no one.
He said the lack of knowledge is understandable.
People interact in different ways today," he said.
It's like a neighborhood where people meet regularly.
On the part of the churches, he worries that the money gained from selling the property will not last as long as the leaders expect too, "and soon they will return to their original state."
Churches, he added, may be turned into large apartment buildings with private homes that will not help keep the remaining reservoirs in the surrounding area.
The vast majority of people who buy private homes in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so this situation will hasten these churches to be closed as a whole because it is unlikely that people in these buildings will be members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white settlers before Harlem became a black city - the Community of the City in 1870 and called St. Martin a decade later.
Native Methodists who were white left in the 1930s.
The blacks who were participating in the nearby area took up the buildings.
St. Martin became the subject of black allies under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the strike on retail retailers at 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or associate with black people.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but when the members of the Johnson Priestly Church put in place plans to rebuild it, they issued an authority for the establishment of a set of alarms played using a keyboard or automated technique.
Reverend David Johnson, son of the Reverend Johnson and successor of St. Martin, called the alarm set "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the set of the bell in July called it another name: "The treasure of culture" and "an unchangeable historical instrument."
A professional, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also recognized that it was the world's first set of bells that was played by black musician, Dionsio A. Lind, who moved into the scene of the largest set in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin did not seek anyone else to replace him.
The bells that have been played in St. Martin over the past several months have been played by architects and contractors in a controversial way, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by the episcopate.
The Council - a supervisory authority in the parish, composed of church administrators - wrote a diocese in July worried that the diocese "had a plan to transfer costs" to the council, even though the council had not been involved in hiring architects and contractors who were sent by the diocese.
Some of the participants were frustrated with the lack of clarity from the diocese.
The Pope injured a 13-year-old boy as he dived to set up a tree-tree in California
The Pope raided a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived to set up a tree-tree in California on the first day of the string-tree season, officials said.
The raid took place shortly before 1 p.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a young man screaming for help and then they rowed with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that the first time he thought it was just the excitement of laying a tree, but "I realized that he was screaming, 'I'm sick!
I've been born!"
His shoulder bone was coming out," Hammel said after reaching out to the boy.
I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed as in critical condition.
The Pope's death is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that the pope had appeared in the area a few weeks ago, but it was revealed that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for surveillance and security reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's seeks to combat Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using an array of aesthetic styles consisting of workers who are professional assistants.
As a major part of planning to enter the £2.8 billion beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and home appliances sales dwindle, a huge array of beauty products will be tested at 11 stores across the country and introduced in more stores next year if this move is successful.
Investment in beauty has come as supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelf spaces that were used to keep TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the supply of beauty products to 3,000, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweizerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing brands ranging from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with similar branded sites located in stores such as Boots.
This large supermarket is also re-launching a variety of cosmetic products so that most of the products are suitable for non-meat people - something that is strongly encouraged by young buyers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and daily food shopping preferences to a lesser extent in a nearby retail store mean supermarkets have to make more effort to entice people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive at Sainsbury, said the shops would be more visible as units stores with a series of supermarkets trying to deal with Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been establishing small Argos shops in hundreds of stores and also established some of the Habitats stores from when it bought the two series two years ago, which says it has increased grocery sales and made customer service more beneficial.
The first attempt by the supermarket to revive its beauty and medicinal properties was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's piloted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger collapsed after a dispute over how to share proceeds from its supermarkets.
A new approach was introduced after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celsio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds will contribute to the program, by adding more luxury face and skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, director of Sainsbury's business, said: "We have changed the appearance and nature of our array of beauty products to improve the environment of our customers.
We have also invested in professionals to be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands have been designed to meet all the needs and attractive environments and the right place means that we have now become an exciting place for beauty products that offer great competition for the original ways to make a purchase."
Peter Jones 'regrets' after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m business deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was left "out of anger" after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have enough time for their Truly home product brand and spare parts.
The two businesses were linked to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning, a 37-year-old presenter, posted on Instagram announcing that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons star Den Peter Jones frustrated by withdrawing from their luxury fashion brand business at the last minute - to focus on her new luxurious deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "proud" when the popular TV presenter admitted at a much-anticipated meeting on Tuesday at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business plans - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she wouldn't have had enough time to address their brand of home appliances and Truly spares.
The business was compared to a Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow and had been said to have doubled Willoughby's fortunes estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, wrote on Instagram that he was leaving the business of Truly, Jones left the UK on a plane to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truth was one of the things that Holly focused on.
It was his permanent home which would allow him to continue for more than a decade.
His decision to leave was a surprise to everyone.
No one knew what was going on, but the weather was very good.
There is a store in the Marlow headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the UK's most reliable broadcaster This Morning, could cost the business millions of dollars due to massive investments in products including rivers, candles, clothing and home appliances and the possibility of a delay in launching.
It can lead to a long term friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple could be on vacation with Jones, who owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production.
Willoughby is expected to be the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we could not comment on his business dealings."
A conversation that "we love each other"
He joked about criticism he would get from news organizations for making comments that some would consider to be "irresponsible" for the president and for praising the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so disappointed?
Trump said in a sarcastic tone "newscaster".
I didn't give up on anything.
He pointed out that Kim preferred a second summit after their first summit in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step in denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after a meeting in Singapore in June, North Korean ambassador Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly Saturday that the North Korean nation had not seen a "matched step" from the United States in the initial steps of denuclearization.
Instead, he said, the United States has developed sanctions that aim to increase pressure.
Trump had a positive attitude in his speech.
We're going well with North Korea," he said.
We were close to North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
Now we have a good partnership."
He said his efforts to improve cooperation with Kim had brought positive results - suspending rocket tests, assisting in the release of hostages and assisting in the repatriation of dead American troops.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people on the island.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Even though more than 10 percent of the people of Lombok were displaced, no national disaster was declared, a condition needed to trigger international support.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have become very clear that they are not asking for international help, and that poses a challenge." Ms. Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children team is traveling to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Due to the frequent earthquakes that occur in Indonesia, the country remains in a state of unpredictability due to natural disasters.
Although residential huts due to the tsunami impact are built in Aceh, they are not widely found in coastal areas.
The real lack of tsunami warning bells in Palu, even though the warning was there, may have contributed to the disaster.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are causing disruptions in transport.
A hospital ship set up in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo used the collapsed infrastructure in Indonesia to be at the heart of your election campaign, and spent a lot of money on road and rail construction.
But the financial crisis has been a challenge for Mr. Jokowi's government ahead of next year's elections.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectoral groups, where many Muslim partners have had conservative beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced when Christian and Muslim groups clashed on the streets, sending swords, bows and arrows and other powerful weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hits a tight balance sheet against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing a Premier League game against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at around 30 yards from Chelsea's gate with his team 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left foot before lifting the butler to the upper edge of the gate.
The ball flew over the defense area and towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then the ball passed over the Kepa Arrizabalaga who had jumped and ended up in the net.
It was just trying to be in that position, to reach the ball with players like Shaq at all times playing the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to get myself as long as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and I took one touch and I didn't even think about it and just shot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after scoring a 25-minute goal from Belgium's Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward scored a goal and returned to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before moving around in the centre of the pitch and running on the side of Liverpool's gate.
Kovacic gave a pass to another player and surrounded the opponent and received him in the middle of the field.
Then he took a knife that allowed him to get into the hole.
Hazard overpowered the guards and scored a goal on the other side of the gate with a left leg shot against Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the group stages of the Champions League at 9pm on Wednesday at the Stade San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are meeting with Videoton in the Europa League at 9 a.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves of up to 20 feet high, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is packed with rubble due to collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 1.55 a.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything about it.
Inspector General Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would urge anyone close to John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything he doubted in contact with us.
I would also like to urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything with their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was inside the building.
A friend of mine told me that she was in the area this morning to ask questions about her whereabouts.
Police say they are in the process of informing their family members.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his home but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't say anything when he realized what had happened.
Residents are now told that it may take several hours before they are allowed to enter the building.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
He goes on to repeat the words "deeply incredulous."
At 8 p.m., police cars were inside the building and another car was out.
Several officers stood inside the apartment and followed the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is requested to send a private message to @MerPolCC, make 101 calls or contact the Crimestoppers team without identifying themselves through 0800 555 111 and refer to the 247th anniversary of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the latest reminder to face the crisis of 'rewriting history'
His removal would be a fitting right for the Taliban's similar destruction to the many religious and cultural art of Britain practiced by its staunch supporters of the Puritans.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "will respond to rewriting history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It would not be inevitable in the current debate regarding the removal of the statue as an example of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Castle would be targeted.
The act of destroying models in the civil war in Britain was neither ordered nor enforced by Cromwell.
Perhaps the worst that Cromwell would have been blamed for was his grandfather Thomas's actions in the last century.
Mr. William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive representation to Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's views and part of the history of a person many believe is still worthy of being celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is revered by many, perhaps more in the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament due to external pressure, a situation for him that was a source of royal leadership.
All of this is an accurate representation of the topic of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-to-late 17th century war has laid the foundation for the future development of our country and Cromwell is an individual identified as representing one wing of those opposing factions.
His success as the Lord's Keeper deserves to be celebrated and celebrated."
A pig kills a Chinese farmer and kills a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in south-western China, according to media reports in the area.
The man, identified by the last name "Yian," was found dead with a vein badly damaged with blood on the market near Liupanshui in Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig room on May 20, 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead, and discovered the door to the pig's neighbor's hut was open.
He said there was a pig in his mouth that had a blood clot.
An investigation confirmed that the 550-pound pig had caught and killed the farmer, according to reports.
My cousin's legs were blood-stained and broken," the man, referred to by his first name as "Wu," said, as quoted by the newspaper Guiang Evening News.
Videos from security cameras showed Yuan arriving at the market at 10.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked away to prevent him from invading another person, as police collected evidence in the area.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating over his death.
Although it does not occur often, the conditions of pigs to invade humans have been previously recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman with her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a £650-weight pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his grandmother shocked him and ran away.
After a farmer in Oregon was raised by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive but tasted blood can be a "catalyst."
They're just playing.
They're dead, and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to respect them," he said.
Hurricane Rosa remains to bring heavy rains across the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa continues to weaken as it passes over the tulip waters off the coast of northern Mexico.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and southwestern the United States over the next few days.
Hurricane Rosa was a maximum windfall of 85 mph, Type 1 hurricane, at 11 am. Eastern time on Sunday, and appeared 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
At this time, the space zone began to accumulate over the Pacific Ocean and head east towards the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to push tropical humidity toward the north in the southwest of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa will bring in 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity that begins to interact with the surrounding atmosphere will cause a lot of rain in the southwest in the future.
In indoor areas, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will lead to catastrophic flooding, mudslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall levels to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in one place, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches of rain in the southwestern parts of the country, especially in many parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur due to persistent conditions due to high tropical rainfall conditions.
It would be very dangerous to go out into the desert on foot due to the risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause landslides that large rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong winds and strong dust.
A nearby canyon will cause a lot of rain in some parts of southern California.
Overall rainfall levels exceeding half an inch are likely to occur, which can lead to a slower slope of mud and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the area.
Some of the flooded tropical showers will begin heading to Arizona later on Sunday and Monday in the morning, before further rains later on Monday and Tuesday.
There will be heavy rains in the four corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, temperatures across the U.S. could change, with temperatures in the Arctic dropping, but areas in the tropical region still have moderate temperatures.
This sometimes leads to sudden changes in temperature at a short distance.
There is a good example of a sudden difference in temperature across the center of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the approaching summer heat will try to accumulate and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern regions of the United States are expected to be warm in early October with a spread of 80 degrees from the southern plains to the north-west.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high probability of extreme temperatures in the eastern United States up to the half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched testimony on Thursday with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual assault that is said to have taken place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters cutting short regular episodes to cover the final stages of Friday's events: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh caught up in the secret when he was drunk and tried to strip him of clothes at a high school ceremony.
Kavanaugh, giving emotional testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people as reported by Nielsen on Friday watched.
The company was counting the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC stations.
Data was not immediately available from other networks that aired, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen's organization usually has the challenge of counting people who look in the office.
To put this into an appropriate perspective, that is an audience that is aligned with the sport's target audience of the primaries or the Academy Training Awards.
The Fox News station, whose commenters have been heavily linked to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all networks to an estimated 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC station was second with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The pain continued after the stroke.
Flake was a major topic in the Friday case.
After the moderate Republican official issued a statement that he would be in favor of Kavanaugh's appointment, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning in a protest by protesters as he tried to mount an elevator to attend the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stopped for a few minutes and was greeted by an incident on CNN.
I'm standing here in front of you," a woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
She was told, "You are strong when most women are not strong."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have much to say in the committee's case.
Broadcasting and cable networks were all running live several hours later, while the Judiciary Committee was voting to extend Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a full vote.
But Flake said he could do so with the understanding that the FBI could investigate allegations against the nominee in the coming weeks, something that few Democrats have been questioning.
Flake was convinced to some degree by a conversation with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After talks with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was powerful, because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation through the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused opponents of "playing politics" over Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused opponents of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the European Union should collect each other's taxes is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims: Police have arrested Dyeon Simpson in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his balance during the fight.
Police recovered sunglasses from the scene of the attack and said they found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, the WAFB, a member of CBS, said.
After questioning Simpson, police said they had confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail is set to be $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head inside the neck.
The department congratulates the Louisiana State Police, police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU sporting director Joe Alleva thanked the local law authority for " diligence and justice."
James was 20 years old.
The 6 to 6-foot striker was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for the LSU basketball team.
He scored between 5.6 and 2.6 points in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply affected" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
Such things are always worrying people," Wade said.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the surrounding areas of southern Mexico's capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased inside the crater and recorded 183 times the amount of gas and ash in more than 24 hours.
The site was followed by a lot of trails and trails.
Images on social media showed thin ash covering car mirrors in parts of Mexico's neighboring city such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have noticed an increase in activity on a volcano that is located 45 miles (720 km) south-east of the capital since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence day
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police as thousands joined protests to mark the first year of Catalonia's independence vote.
A group of pro-separated protesters beat them with eggs and threw them in powder, which caused black clouds on the streets that would normally have many tourists.
The clashes also took place later that day, with police using their staffs to fight back.
For more than a dozen hours, separatist groups that said "no to forget, no apology" clashed with coalition demonstrators who said, "Spain always."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region, which favours independence a year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, although the number of people who came out low while those who opposed independence abstained largely.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, sparking violent clashes.
Pro-democracy groups had camped all night on Friday to stop protests to support the national police.
The protests continued, but they had to take a different approach.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we lived in the best time of our lives.
I looked at my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite securing an important victory in the last regional election in December, Catalan independence-supporting parties have failed to maintain momentum this year, with many more known leaders in exile for their self-determination or detention waiting for a trial to prepare a referendum and a statement of future independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic recording a protest in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict had been caused by politicians from both sides.
Anxiety continues to grow," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for a seat in the European Parliament elections next year.
Standing up as the candidate of the European Parliament elections is the best way to reject the backsliding of the democratic values and oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
London: Man arrested after being hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was swept away in a row by a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at the Ballanagard Crescent on Thursday at 1:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the gates and the building itself.
The car may have been hit by a fire at some point.
Menga goal to give Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Livingston's promotion surprised Rangers by resulting in Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike was the result of a split between both teams, while Gary Holt's side moved to second place in the same position as Hibernian.
Gerrard's side remain unbeaten in away matches in the Premier League this season and will face leaders Hearts, who are eight points ahead of them next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston has increased the number of matches they have failed to be six in the division, where head coach Holt has not yet failed since taking over from Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on a chance against the underprivileged
Holt's team had to be ahead long before scoring, with their direct attacking game causing Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson was able to get a chance but failed to score a goal for his net passing in front of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could just kick the ball out after he slipped in to meet the header ball from Craig Halkett.
The locals didn't seem to worry and allow Rangers to own the game, knowing that they could frustrate the visitors using the basket balls.
That's where they were able to beat Golgotha.
Rangers were punished for a club bite and Livingston struggled to get a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to give Menga a chance, who touched and scored a goal from the centre of the box.
At the time, Rangers had controlled possession of the ball but failed to penetrate the home defense for the home team and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not interrupted for a long period of time.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save his bite.
Scott Pittman was banned from scoring the goal and the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow played the ball out after another Liverpool game.
The attacks continued to bite the Livingston team box and continued to be lifted, while two penalties charges - after Halket dropped reserve player Glenn Middleton, and the other on hand-held possession - were ignored.

Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great work and good results for Livingston.
In reality, they had the best game and kept multiplying expectations and by continuing to climb up the table.
Their style of play with the team has not changed much since returning to the Premier League, but many compliments go to Holt in the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett scored a huge, well-managed defensive fortress, while Menga always gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a hand in the whole match.
The Rangers didn't get a shot, though.
As they have sometimes been good under Gerrard, they were under such standards.
They missed the last touch in the gate - only once they were able to create a scoring opportunity in the home team's cage - and that's a challenge for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to normalise relations between the two NATO allies.
They have varied in issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's access to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as a barrier for a crowd of 25,000 people not to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of anti- Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-wing protests mark a split over the view of a president who is seen as a hero to some German Turks and praised by others as a dictator.
Road accident in Stratford: driver dies after hit by car
A bus driver has died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Road and Evelyn Road, a busy road in Straford, south-east of the city, at 4:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and emergency personnel arrived but the man died at the scene.
The accident comes months after another bicycle driver died in a crash on Children's Road, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
City police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks and other buses have been installed and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in violence
Six prison officials were injured in the violence in the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The violence took place at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 3:30 BST on Sunday and continues.
The "Tornado" experts have been brought up to deal with the violence, which involves eight inmates and has been held at one prison's periphery.
The officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison service spokesman said: "Private-trained prison staff have been brought in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for minor injuries.
We don't support violence in our prisons and it's clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and they can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a major crisis in which workers were forced to gamble.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (Summer Zones May Benefit)
It's not uncommon for tropical pressure fluctuations to occur in Arizona, but that's exactly what could happen as early as next week when the rest of Hurricane Rosa's power goes out in the West Desert causing a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a sudden flood warning Monday and Tuesday to the west of Arizona toward southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday and approach later on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that "10 tropical cyclones have sustained storms and low pressure conditions within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
Recent examples of the National Hurricane Center forecast 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a few levels of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the West Desert including the Great Basin Rockies are likely to gain 1 to 2 inches and potentially find fewer levels of up to 4 inches.
For those outside of the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa can be a blessing because the area is drier.
Although the floods cause serious concern, some of these rains may be useful because the southern parts of the West are experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor. just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one severe drought, the second highest form," weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land access through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still a powerful hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is heading north for 12 kilometers per hour.
The storm is experiencing static water in the Pacific and so its strength is decreasing.
So, it is expected to reach the ground in Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or on the evening of Monday.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be severe and cause severe flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California to Sonora in the northwest and potentially reach up to 10 inches," weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical storm and then head up through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The main risk expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remains is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the North West Desert of Sonora and the United States. Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
Rain is expected to lead to flash floods and mudslides in deserts and landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: the arrest of four people who attempted to commit murder
Three 20-year-old men have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured at Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, at around 10:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was admitted in a "firm" condition.
A 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have asked anyone who may have captured an incident by a mobile phone to emerge.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "demonstrated, selfish and angry" by Democrats
The vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject Democrats' brutal and cowardly tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been "shown the bitterness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Parliament on Thursday, strongly and emotionally rejecting allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she sexually abused him several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the case regarding the woman's claims.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people saw the genius and excellence" of Kavanaugh that day.
Voting to prove Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to prove one of the most complete legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a good record of public service," he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The president referred to Kavanaugh's indirect nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters emerging to vote in the election of representatives.
Five weeks from now one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running in a different direction," he said.
That's why I'm going everywhere to promote good candidates.
Trump said the Democrats wanted to "oppose and prevent."
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected before Friday, a senior supporter of the GOP leadership has told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia's earthquake, tsunami and death tolls
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away when huge waves reached the beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a ceremony on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves measuring six meters (18 feet) struck land at night and prayed for many and destroyed everything that was there.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the threat of a tsunami struck yesterday, people were still working on the coast and did not immediately flee and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster prevention agency BNPB, said at a news conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it came with cars, logs, houses, it affected everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had sailed through the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the coast.
Some people planted trees to avoid the tsunami and saved themselves, he said.
At least 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 points in Palau.
Aerial imagery provided by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops damaged, bridges were overturned and submerged by a water-soaked mosque.
Small earthquakes continued to occur in the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the amount of power compared to the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geography, which is found at the end of a narrow minute could have led to an increase in tsunamis, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels were damaged.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 others were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast of 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, near the heart of the quake.
Communication was "completely disabled without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said, adding that staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
This is already a pandemic, but it could be even worse," he said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not letting it know that the tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves came shortly after a warning was issued.
In a non-professional video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can sound the sound of tsunami warnings approaching people on the road.
Within a few minutes the water waves reach the beach and carry buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage in a wider area that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo and aid flights from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been closed for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala were safely in the city of Palu, where workers were sheltering in tents set outside their office, they went through the devastating events along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw many homes destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even though aid groups began aid operations, some suspected foreign workers with extensive expertise were barred from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesia's laws, money, equipment and workers from abroad can only enter into force if the pandemic declares to be national.
This has not yet happened.
It's still a regional-level disaster," said Aulia Arrani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we can open up to international support but there is still no situation.
On the second night of the earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who had lost hope that their loved ones would be reunited and make a miracle in their hopeless stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was found in a garbage can.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subondono, coach of the Indonesian national team, had coached two of the missing parachute skippers for the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of those who stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
As a leader in the field of umbrella jumping, I have my emotional load," he said.
Mr Gendon explained how, hours after information about the Roa Hotel spread among the community of participants in the umbrella jump, he had sent a WhatsApp message to the palu competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed one grey mark, rather than two blue symbols.
I think that means the message was not read," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 when filling an ATM in Leveport
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink worker as he filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was withdrawing money from the ATM in the entertainment room and preparing to deposit more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While in charge, another person "run from the back of a Brink worker" and stole a package of funds meant to be shipped.
Witnesses saw several suspects escaping from the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "He"
Kanye West changed his name to "Yes."
Announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "A creature officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed "Ye" for a while and used the title as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
This change takes place before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on a show that was canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
Despite being an acronym for his current professional name, West has previously said that the term has religious significance to him.
I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, referring to the name of his album and radio producer Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us.
It evolved from Kanye, which means the only person, and just being He - to be an example of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more of an example of how we are."
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was often known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his love and brother love.
A former West member, Jay-Z, has also been forced to use his or her name with a lower or lower backline.
Mexico's military has vowed not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use the military against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of mass killings of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to counter the Mexican people."
Troops shot at peaceful protests in the building on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people as the leftist student movement was taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by providing a monthly grant to students and opening free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of access to education led young people to join gangs of crime.
The U.S. should double its A.I. funding.
As China continues to engage more in innovative thinking, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in the field, said AI investor and specialist, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various U.S. government units issued announcements about AI, even though the U.S. generally lacks an official AI strategy.
At the same time, China launched its plan last year: and aims to be number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Raising the AI budget will be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are behind the United States and are looking for new innovations in AI," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next big AI breakthrough will take place in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: : China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most popular AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University created an AI system that conquered the top U.S.-grade Othello player and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged that the U.S. government's initial state-of-the-art technology competition as a robotics agency in Defense's extensive research programs and asked to know when another competition would be, to help identify future professionals.
Researchers in the United States often have to do extra work to get government aid, Lee said.
It's not China that takes professional leaders, it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited stars from universities to work in AI in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the United States strengthen its efforts in AI.
I think green cards should be given directly to PhD students in AI," he said.
China's Council of State released its Plan of Development into Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in similar educational institutions as the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government agencies provides funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is low in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Collaborative Centre in Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from industry and academia with the White House announced the creation of an Investigation Committee in Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a program called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently offers over $100 million annually in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. law that wanted to create a National Security Commission in Artificial Intelligence has not made progress for several months now.
Macedonians cast their votes on the country's name change
Macedonians voted on Sunday to change its name to "North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that impedes its membership request in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, has maintained that the name of neighbouring countries in the north represents a claim for its region and has opposed the country's request to become a NATO and EU member.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposed new name, but nationalists say the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Salvadoran population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a ignoring campaign has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will reach the 50 percent needed for the referendum to be accurate.
The question in the referendum reads: "Do you support NATO's membership with the EU and agree to an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is an appropriate guarantee to be accepted into organisations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created due to the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia so that they can live independently under the auspices of the European Union because that means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally recognised, enough members of parliament have said they will support the results of the vote to make it more serious.
The name change will require support from two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there had been no reports of violations by 7 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country which paves the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and arranging seats in front of tents created by those who would oppose the referendum.
We support NATO and the European Union, but we want to join in love, not through the back door to pressure," said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our own respect.
If they don't want to register us as Macedonia, we can join others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian cooperation."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO's membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a 20 percent unemployment rate.
I believe the majority will support it because 80 percent of our citizens support the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the results of "yes" would be "proof of our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters took part in the referendum - less than the required level.
Another study, carried out by Macedonian television Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be held, the voter turnout should be 50 percent and one vote.
The failure in the referendum will represent the first major blow to a Western-backed government since it took office in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City moves around Brighton's full back and scoring goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling humiliated Brighton's defenders in a match Manchester City won 2-0 Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it very easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass in the centre of the field and set up a series.
He went through three weeks of Brighton, before passing through the open area.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four players.
He pushed one week and then speeded up the other at the edge of the Brighton gate.
Then he turned his head to the other side and grabbed the ball.
The England striker first used his touch in the box and returned the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg around Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and a spear into the right-hand side of the net.
Aguero is facing some problems at his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have him at that time."
But it is Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first control in a Premier League match.
They were held for 29 minutes.
Aguero received a ball inside Brighton in the attack.
He scored a good pass through the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched it a few times before he gave Sterling a pass on the other side of the gate.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball into the net before it started celebrating.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 6:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be an Arab against. Rockies
While the Nationals had already been eliminated from the playoffs, there was no other reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who has a lot of competition, hopes to be a barrier on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still a big impact in the primaries for the Rockies, who are proud to have one game they haven't played against Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
Rockies won the chance to play a qualifying match by winning 5-2 against National on Friday night, but are still looking for the first title in the division.
Although we don't play for anything, at least we can play a tough game based on the situation here in Denver and the crowd and the other team will be playing at the highest level at every level I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to fight against that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start the game on Sunday, but say they would like to allow Scherzer to fly the ball.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th game, practiced on Thursday and will be flying on his day off on Sunday.
The Washington right-hand man has 18-7 and an average of 2.53 runs and 300 points to be eliminated by hitting 220 2/3 this season.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president referred to the indirect situation of his nominee Brett Kavanaugh at the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of Republicans emerging in the election of representatives.
All of the successes we've had in the past.
Five weeks from the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the biggest choices - I'm not running, but in another perspective I'm really running and that's why I'm going around to promote good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see what they are doing right now.
And they decided to take power by any means possible, you can see greed, corruption.
They don't care about people who hurt them, who offend them in order to gain authority and control, what they want is authority and control, we can't give them."
He said that the Democrats are trying to "fight and fight."
And you can see that in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the people of anger and of the corrupt and liars."
He mentioned a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, by the name, which made the audience boo him.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you make a wrong statement?
Ah, yeah, what is it.
No, not, I waited for one - that was the weakest body language - the worst language I've ever seen."
The church is no longer a church.
It doesn't take away free thinking
When the Democrats in the House voted to remove me, it wasn't surprising.
After all, I am one in line with Labour MPs to be told that we don't want to - all by saying our thoughts.
My colleague in parliament Joan Ryan was treated the same way because she stood up for her anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal to remove me was offensive to me by disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of an appropriate economic policy, on national security, on the European issue, it is in itself that the issues are similar to those that Jeremy contrasts with previous leaders.
A statement at a Labour conference in Nottingham on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For more than eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC's night meetings have been inclusive of that at all.
Sadly today, it did not match many of the meetings with the promise of politics "kind, generous" it has long been forgotten if, in fact, it had begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not accepted in the Labour Party and all opinions are treated well if they are accepted by the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a colleague who I thought shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to change my mind completely and take on positions I would never have agreed on - whether it was about national security or a single market in the European Union.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I'm saying - what follows is insults on social media and attempts to get me elected, reject middle-class politics, and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not the situation I've been through alone.
I know I'm more interested than others because I'm a political person.
I have a lot of respect for the skills and statements of colleagues who suffer from sexual or racial abuse on a daily basis but never give up.
One of the most frustrating aspects of today's politics is how levels of violence are considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer an integrated church and with every debate neither a "disbelief" or a change in the principles of selection, the party becomes more narrow in inclusion.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years being encouraged to calm down, not to talk too much and that "I'm going to be okay."
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, due to the frustration of being ignored by the government of Thatcher which left my school class almost in ruins, I have struggled to fight for the best public services for those most in need - be it a local councillor or a government minister.
I don't want to hide my political views, including those of the past.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused about the attitudes in policy and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who have brought forward the debate on Friday, all I'm going to say is that as the country approaches leaving the European Union famous Brexit, a move that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I don't want to waste my time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for the citizens in my area, whether members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve them and I promise that there is no amount of threats to removal or political relativism to keep me from focusing on what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr's undisputed team still tops the table
Two attempts at the end-time may have changed to some degree the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very exciting tentenent league match.
Now leading the table, a unique team that has not failed.
Ultimately, it was their best defense, as well as the use of their positions, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had the right to be satisfied.
We have been tested in our games so far, and we haven't failed, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, issued for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to use the opportunity to have more players and Jason Baggot scored an unsuccessful attempt.
Climo added Ayr's lead to the penalty, just before the break time, scored and then completed the test alone and made the score 17-5 for Ayr during the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, was scored by Baggot, reducing the lead by five points.
Then the game was stopped temporarily after a dangerous injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the game when it was restarted, Ayr added his lead to the Stafford McDowall test, which was closed by Climo.
Ayr Blair Macpherson's acting captain then received a yellow card and again, Melrose took advantage of the opportunity to have one more player and scored for Bruce Colvine's trial, the end of a period of intense pressure.
The home team took control again, however, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for fouling Climo without a ball and from the penalty line out, MacPherson scored due to a strong attack from Ayr.
Climo scored, how he did after the game started again, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's shot and beat Gregor Henry and scored the fifth attempt for the home team.
The Star of the Game Still Takes a New Job in the Restaurant Industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears to have entered the housing industry after being appointed as the company's managing director.
The 56-year-old star features Jack Jarvis on a popular BBC show, in which he is co-author and actor of his long-time collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in a period and it appears Kiernan has another plan in life after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although the Scottish Sun newspaper reported that Kiernan was expecting to be involved in a "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
• "The ocean is ours": Bolivia, which does not have a port hoping that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Mariners patrol at the maritime headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up blue flags like the sea.
The maritime terminals from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are said to be: "The ocean is ours for justice.
Giving back is a responsibility."
Across the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the lost coastline to Chile in the 19th-century resource crisis is still vivid - just as the desire to travel back into the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is likely to be even higher for many years, as Bolivia waits for the verdict of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and stability and indeed has the prospect of a positive outlook for the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A majority of Bolivians will watch the ICJ ruling on a large screen across the country, hoping that a court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claims - after decades of due negotiations - Chile will be forced to negotiate a move to give Bolivia a way to reach the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's natural president - who faces a tough battle in re-election next year - also has much to say about Monday's decision.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will make a decision that suits Bolivia - and that there will be very little change even if it decides so.
The Dutch-based agency does not have the authority to award the Chilean territory to other countries, and has said it cannot determine the outcome of the talks.
The ICJ's decision will come just six months after the final debate signalled that the case was "not controversial," said Paz Zárate, Chile's specialist in international law.
And in addition to advancing the hope of Bolivia, the last four years may have been back.
The issue of maritime access is being misused by the current administration of Bolivia," said Zárate.
Morales' political rhetoric has brought an end to Chile's good intentions, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will continue the negotiations, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's ruling was too fast.
On Monday it will give Bolivia a "major opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of divergence in common interests," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of South America's most prominent presidents - was using the sea as a political channel.
Bolivia will never give up on its right to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The decision is an opportunity to recognize that we need to move forward.
North Korea says denuclearization is possible unless it has confidence in the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never give up its nuclear weapons first if it could not have confidence in Washington.
He was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart a nuclear diplomacy that had not been successful for more than three months after a meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "little dream" that developing U.S. sanctions and opposition to the end of the Korean War would make North Korea weak.
Washington is afraid of accepting information without Pyongyang first making the necessary steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second summit.
But there is no doubt that Pyongyang is considering denuclearization, which the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to host the second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion show in Paris showcases the latest head gearing equipment heading to Luxury Stores around you
If you want to increase the concentration of your caps or completely block the sun then you have found a solution.
The experts Valentino and Thom Browne launched some of the biggest headphone devices in their SS19 collection in a platform exhibition that was surprisingly creative in Fashion Week in Paris.
The hats that are difficult to create have attracted a lot of attention in Instagram this summer and these designers have provided these stylish hats to be used in a fashion platform.
The most interesting feature of Valentino was the blue cap placed on the wide edges with feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other great accessories include timid models, wizard hat and even pineapple - but they're not designed to give your head a warm edge.
Tom Brown has also unveiled the stunning masks - at a time when Halloween is approaching.
Many colorful face masks had lips sewn with the appearance of Hannibal Lecter rather than fashion skills.
One design resembled a skyba dive device with a bow and sunglasses, while the other was similar to a molten ice cream cone.
And if you keep up with the great fashion news - you're lucky.
Viewers of fashion predict that large balloons can be on the way to luxury shops around you.
Very large hats offer creativity in 'La Pipe', a canopy with two-foot wide edges leading everyone to wear it from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label's supporters created this complex hat that was released on social networks made another high-tech design used in fashion platform - a large scale beach bag using a swimming dress model
The orange-colored raffi package, placed on the edge by a leather handle, is the most attractive one at the Jacques 'La Riviera conventions of the SS19 in Paris Fashion Week.
Well-known fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing a big hat and beach bags by the end of next summer - because the architect has made a huge impact that will be difficult to ignore the demand for large equipment.'
John Edwards: Language skills are important for the international community.
Scottish independent schools continue to maintain a record of academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 for another set of outstanding test results, which are enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other community endeavours.
With an increase of more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland (popular SCIS), strive to provide a better level of care for students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, the disciplines they choose and their place as international citizens.
As an educational sector that can create and implement a special school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and a preferred subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, that goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his native language, that goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships with people from other countries.
Given the recent results of this year's exam, we can see that languages lead the league table with high score levels in independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language learners received an A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of learners received a higher A score in Mandarin and 72 per cent in those who learned German, 69 per cent for those who learned French and 63 per cent for Spanish learners also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people need in their future.
Languages now, as the subject of choice, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that one of the reasons employers said they were having the challenge of filling in job vacancies, 17 percent was associated with a lack of language skills.
So more and more, language skills become essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
While many job opportunities are required for language, this knowledge is essential in the globalized world.
Regardless of the profession that one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a more real chance in the future to have such a life skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will put a person who speaks a variety of languages forward in the competition.
According to YouGov's survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language properly in order to keep the conversation in French, which is the only language spoken by two per cent of the population, 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially those in developing countries, will give children a better chance of getting meaningful employment.
Each school has a different language.
Several schools will focus on more modern languages, some of which will teach languages that are considered most important to the UK in the near future until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, as well as training specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of their future careers.
It cannot be disputed that at this time, in the context of international trade, that languages continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills."
Private schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
The devil is fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Council of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron played his first game with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is approaching for fans eager to see LeBron James play the first match as a Los Angeles Lakers player.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a pre-season match on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is still unclear how long he will play.
It will be more than a minute and less than 48," Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James could play in a few minutes.
Following a practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in the Lakers' six pre-season schedule.
I don't need to play games before the season in this stage of my game to be ready," he said.
Trump's political rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Donald Trump will start a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
You will be the first of five meetings that are scheduled to take place next week, including standing in areas where he has many supporters including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a vote to confirm whether Trump is still undecided on filling the Supreme Court's mandate, Trump is aiming to create support in the election as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
How long will Trump's meeting in West Virginia be and how can you watch it online?
The Trump Summit in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 1pm. Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about a trial this week on the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has raised concerns about allegations of sexual harassment that led to a temporary Senate vote in a week's time when the FBI is investigating.
But the aim of this series of meetings is to encourage Republican candidates in the November election to gain more popularity.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign committee said these five meetings over the next week aimed to strengthen volunteers and supporters as the Republican Party tries to protect and expand the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
Senate controls are important to his agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be identified told Reuters.
Organised at Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, this night's rally could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh media coverage," according to the Metro News of West Virginia newspaper.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the study vote.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to try to improve his position in the election," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. teams show a willingness to fight and keep hope going for a single man's game on Sunday
After three runs on one side, Saturday afternoon's two-player game can be the excitement that Ryder Cup needs.
The game of thrones is a game of chance, but it's a game in which the players really believe and even more so in the game.
Where are they going now?
They had six points and now they're four, so we take that as a little bit of momentum," said Jordan Spieth after concluding the day.
Europe has a better chance, of course, they are ahead with four points, with 12 remaining points.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have extra strength and a lot to encourage them, also considering the Spieth and Justin Thomas game they played together all day and each one boasts three out of four points.
Spieth has been at risk from the start of the game to the pit of the game and leads by being a role model.
The majority of the noise to celebrate increased as his turn continued, inserting the ball after hitting the ball into the ditch and balancing when he and Thomas were down with two points after two turns.
His football blow to the ditch won a match for 15 holes and received a lot of cheering noise, which suggests that the American team is not yet heartbroken.
You really have to work hard and focus on your own match," said Spieth.
That's just what the players are doing now.
Eighteen people are waiting for this.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the untold story of Ryder Cup.
This remarkable pair from Europe has four of the four points and they have not made any mistakes at all.
The "Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't hit the ball more times on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided hitting the ball more frequently Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That quality, and how their strength seems to increase among them and the crowd reveals that the players will be the most competitive on Sunday and perhaps none of the most famous players can win for Europe on the day it ends at Le Golf National Stadium if it's not Fleetwood or Molinari.
They all do this at different times in different ways.
It's too early to talk about the victory for Europe.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson struggled well with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the two games against each other, when he created a pair with Alex Noren.
The extra ball and two more balls in the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedish in a situation that was difficult to get out of.
However, on Sunday, no one can get you out of the situation.
The two games against the two are very exciting to watch because of the interaction between the pair, the advice they offer, the advice they don't offer and how the strategy can change instantly.
Europe has done much better as a team so far and taken a big lead towards the last day but this pairing period has also shown that the US team is keen to fight that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe leading by 10-6 in the Ryder Cup on the last day
Europe will have a good place in the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning in a pair match with four balls for 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's pair led the game with a double win over Tiger Woods, who appeared to have scored four goals so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, battling to retain the trophy that they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, led the United States to a seemingly weighted finish in a four-morning ball game, winning 3-1 in a row.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the pairing games against the pair and won two matches, but they were unable to remove the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new player in Europe to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an exciting weekend became only the second pair to win four of their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball match, he won the Wood with American Bryson Dechambeau for 5 and 4.
Woods, who was behind in both games on Saturday, showed good game shows but has now lost 19 of 29 games in four games and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to work with Henrik Stenson in a pairing match and lost 2 and 1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - they were ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't get everything though a good, windy day in south-west Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the precedent for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 wins against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and later won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in a pair game after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of Ryder Cup where the team managed to go from back to back with four points to one man's game, although Furyk's team only needs from a draw to stay with the trophy.
After being in second place for two days, however, the fight to win on Sunday seems to be far from them.
North Korea says it is "impossible" to disarm without the belief that others will do what they want.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the imposition of sanctions would undermine U.S. confidence and that no country would be able to remove its nuclear weapons without others doing their jobs under the same conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had taken "good-faith measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
Without any trust from the United States there will be no confidence in our national security in such a situation and there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first without others doing what they should."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's grievances over Washington's "action" approach to denuclearization where North Korea would receive a small amount of gold, his statement seemed necessary as it did not deny the move to eliminate nuclear weapons on the condition that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to "remove nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal resolution to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must disarm first.
Washington also rejected calls to halt international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists on "the first removal of nuclear weapons" and increases the level of pressure by applying sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling manner and even to oppose "the declaration of the end of war," Ri said.
The view that the sanctions can undermine is an impossible dream from the people who ignore us.
The problem, however, is that the problems persist.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader took place at the U.N. earlier this week.
The minister instead focused on three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If a partner in this issue of denuclearization had been in South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization from the Korean peninsula would not have been in this dire situation."
However, Ri's speech was somewhat different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland and North Korea's rockets would not be inevitable after "wicked president" Trump referred to Kim as a "rocket man" with the goal of committing murder.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea removed its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific time for this, saying: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter.
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should award Pyongyang for its actions.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue in detail and without fail until we get the full, final and verifiable withdrawal of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has extended sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to withdraw funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri after the UN General Assembly later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but only within hours North Korea accused him of making "criminal provisions."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a missile base and also a nuclear weapons plant if the US takes "related steps."
Kim said he had told him the "related measures" he wanted were a security guarantee Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at strengthening ties with Washington.
Harvard students are taught a lesson in getting enough rest.
A new study at Harvard University this year requires all undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the culture of pretending gentlemen and to study for 'all night' with the help of coffee.
A specialist found students at the world number one university do not have any knowledge of the basic issue of how to self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the study, which he believes is the first such study in the United States.
He was inspired to create a lesson after giving a speech about how lack of enough sleep affects training.
At the end of the speech, a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I just being told these things now, in my final year?'
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - something that surprised him," he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which has been introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the basics about how a good sleep pattern helps in professional and sports performance as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to introduce the study after finding out that students had fallen asleep too much during the week.
The full-time study involves a series of collaborative activities.
In one place there is a picture of the bedroom, where students click for coffee, curtains, shoes and books and are informed about the impact of coffee and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of sleep schedule.
In some places, participants are told how a prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The college map and interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
We know this lesson will not change the behavior of the students at once.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like you have the right to know the harm to health when you smoke," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in 'keeping up' still exists, he said, adding that the latest technology and pressure on students continues to increase meant lack of sleep was an ongoing problem.
To ensure that you get enough, quality sleep, you should be the 'secret weapon' of the student in order to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoid adding weight, because lack of sleep makes the mind to be in a state of contentment and make you hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create a lesson, having participated in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the study opened his eyes and gave him the desire to form a whole school.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all qualified students to do the same subject before joining a highly competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students should consider setting up a sleep alarm as well as a time alarm for waking up and aware of the effects of the 'blue light' emitted by electric screens and LED lights, which can damage brain clocks and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mega goal defeats Gerrard's youth
Rangers lost again in another away game when Dolly Menga beat Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were aiming for their first away win since a 4-1 win over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team led Gerrard to a second defeat in 18 games as manager leaving his team eight points behind leaders of the Ladbrokes League, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and Rangers never seemed to balance.
While Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is climbing to third place and they are just behind Hibernian in terms of goal difference.
And there may be more problems for Rangers after the flag bearer Calum Spence needed treatment after he was injured in the head for something thrown from Rangers supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that scored Ayr in the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used all 11 players who drew against Hearts last week and will be pleased with how well-prepared his team has always faced their opponents.
Rangers had more possession of the ball but Livingston used it well when they got the ball.
They had to score only the second minute when Menga's first ball gave Scott Pittman a chance to go to Allan McGregor's gate but the midfielder threw the ball out.
Keaghan Jacobs' football team captain Craig Halkett but his team-mate Alan Lithgow was able to beat it just outside the goal.
The Rangers took control but their game seemed to only be credible but not confident as they approached the closing area.
Alfredo Morelos felt he had to earn a penalty 15 minutes after being knocked down by Steven Lawless but referee Steven Thomson said the game continued even after the Colombian's claim.
Rangers managed to score two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered by a header ball from Lassana Coulibaly and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's goal in the 34th minute was not due to a regular game, no one could deny that they deserved that victory.
The Rangers were no longer able to face off with Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did nothing when Declan Gallagher introduced the ball to Scott Robinson, who was solid and ball-throwing towards Menga who touched and scored.
Gerrard made a decision during a break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the move was about to get a result when the midfielder introduced the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran away from his place to prevent the ball.
But Livingston continued to distract visitors and make them play as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett hitting the ball long after another.
The Holt team could have added a goal in the last minute but McGregor was consistent and prevented Jacobs before Lithgow from hitting the ball out in the head.
Rangers reserve player Glenn Middleton had another charge at the last minute when they faced Jacobs but then referee Thomson dismissed the request.
Year in Year: Geiger Counter device inventor
And now a page from our annual diary of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and continue counting ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger Counter.
The basis of science since then, the Geiger Counter device became popular in popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bell of Coronado," which included scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that in this world?"
Rogers: "It's a Counter Geiger device, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as yuranim.
When you put these headsets on, you can hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radiation inside the metal."
He said, "Tell me, now you're ready!"
Hans "Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery called by his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The technique involves removing the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the laboratory
They can then 'see' a protein that is popular in most cancers and then repositioned.
The experimental vaccine shows positive results in patients with various cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells, was treated for her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, replacing them in the lab so that they can "see" the common protein for many cancers called HER2, and then reposition the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings show that we have a very reliable vaccine."
HER2 "results in the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and gastrointestinal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explained.
Such a method of taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" how to target cancer cells has worked in treating leukemia.
Kanye West has started a bitter review of Trump's support, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on the SNL show.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in a studio during Saturday Night Live after a high-profile performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he could run for office in 2020.
After the performance of his third single that night, Ghost Town where he wore a hat written to Make America Great, he began to rebuke Democrats and promised support for Trump.
When I talk to a white man, he says, "How can you love Trump, he's a racist?"
Yes, if I were concerned about racism I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with a short drama featuring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Committee on Sexual Abuse allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the event was not announced, West's content was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if the Rock attempted to ridicule the West for its publication.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a hard time getting to the podium in relation to his hat.
They made me feel bad after the game.
They said, "Don't go there with the hat."
They killed me!
And then they said that I'm in a situation where I'm immersed," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see a place to sink?" saying that he would wear my hat of a brave warrior, because this means you can't tell me what I should do. What do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments led to at least two booing from an audience with SNL staff who appeared to be embarrassed, Variety's Center reported, with one person there reporting the post: "The entire studio went completely silent."
West had been brought to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West surprised many when he sang the song I Love it, dressed as a perrier bottle of water.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR STANDING TO THE PEOPLE."
But the host of the chat show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was "just showing his point of view and that's a good thing."
But I choose not to reward someone else (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I believe agrees with spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He has freedom.
He added, "We too.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he would now be "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg changed his name to Snoop Lion and, of course, the late Prince changed his name to a sign and then a previously known artist as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces a toxic man
Kit Harington is famous for hitting the sword as Jon Snow in the Game of Thrones fantasy series of the HBO station.
But the 31-year-old actress has lashed out at men with a lot of penises, saying the roles on the screen mean young boys often feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'there's something that's gone wrong' and questioned how to deal with the toxic male problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married fellow star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to feeling 'too many' in dealing with the issue.
I think we're right now - where are we going wrong?" he said.
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, in terms of the problem we are seeing now?
Kit believes that television can be a part of an increase in toxic male characteristics due to her male protagonists.
He continued: "What is natural and what is it taught?
Is that what is being taught on television, and in the streets, which makes young boys feel they should be this kind of man?
I think this is one of the biggest questions we have today - how can we change that?
It's because things are different for our kids.
In an interview he also admitted that he would no longer be involved in front-end games of the Throne when the series ends next season, saying he was satisfied with the battleground and the horse.
From November, Kit will be involved in a film from Sam Shepard's book True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The character recently revealed that the move to meet his wife Rose was the best thing due to his involvement in Game of Thrones.
I met my wife during this period, so I found my future family, and my life from there," he said.
Rose starred as Ygritt, the love interest of the character Jon Snow who played as Kit, in a series of abstracts that won Emmy Awards.
The couple got married in June 2018 in the family estate of Leslie Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials say.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Many of the new events were caused by sex, marking a change from the past.
HIV spread rapidly in other parts of China due to blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had decreased to zero, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a chronic issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality in China was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be very high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% men in same-sex love eventually marry women.
Many of these diseases are caused by a lack of sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access to all HIV drugs as part of efforts to tackle the issue.
Maxine Waters denied that her employee exposed the data of the GOP senators, denounced the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied his employee published personal information of three Republican senators on the pages of the House of Representatives.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles said the allegations were propagated by analysts and websites of "the right-wing supporters".
Lies, lies, and more nonsense," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information provided is purported to include home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Details appeared online Thursday, published by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual assault against the High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came shortly after the senators accused Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the publications was linked to the Waters office and provided details of the Waters employee, Hill reported.
These unfounded claims are utterly false and utterly misleading," Waters continued.
My employee - whose identity, personal details, and safety have been affected by these allegations of fraud and lies - was never responsible for disclosing this information.
These allegations are completely false and misleading."
Waters' statement was quickly condemned online, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
It's an outrage," Fleischer wrote.
This indicates that he has no control over the right emotions to be a member of Parliament.
When a person is accused of something he doesn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
He should not be worried.
He should not question the applicant's intentions.
He should be calm and free of worry.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate vying to remove Waters from the House of Representatives, also posted his thoughts on Twitter.
If it's true, it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false claims."
We will ensure that they are exposed, "continued," and that they will be held accountable for all their actions that are damaging and dangerous to everyone and to all my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - a joke in the investigation of Rowan Atkinson
It is common to watch the impact of Brexit on any new British-based film but that does not apply in a series of other comedy-war films for Johnny English jokes - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is self-satisfaction on the topic of how we are at disposal going to be a new opportunity abroad?
At any rate, Johnny English of eye piercing, a highly moving face is licensed to make mistakes in a re-organised way for the second time - the name showing its most sign that he is designed with a wide-ranging humour to non-English speaking people.
He is in fact a chiropractor who despite the incredible claims for a charming attraction reflects the qualities of Clouseau, the qualities of Mr Bean and the person who contributed to one of the musical themes of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
At first he was involved as a traveler with an international celebrity Atkinson at the same time involved in the forgotten Barclaycard TV broadcasts at the moment, leaving many as if they were not interested.
There's one or two of them in this recent film.
I liked to see Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a traditional armored suit with flammable flammable plates temporarily changing over his hat.
Atkinson's talent in physical comedy was evident here, but the humour seems to be less and less desirable, especially because "big" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible include humor as part of it.
The comedy looks like it's aimed at children and not adults and according to me, Johnny English's unique travels aren't creative and don't focus on how the humour of Atkinson's silent films is associated with Bean.
Every year, the UK is in a serious crisis.
The online raider managed to enter the UK's confidential web site network and reveal the identity of all British spies out at work and surprisingly the whistleblower at work - sadly it was a very simple task for Kevin Eldon.
In her final moments as a proud and most opposition leader, she has already been deeply affected by political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing very well for her character in line with Teresa May but the story does not help to highlight these qualities.
His security advisers inform him that because the identity of each spy has been revealed, he must use a retired person.
And that means using Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a school teacher at a prestigious school, but teaches informal training about how to be a mystery explorer: some of the best humor there, while English teaches detectives similar to the School of Rock film.
English is being restored to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former colleague Bough, who is re-introduced by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, associated with a submarine commander, an exciting opportunity where Vicki Pepperdine is not involved.
So the characters matched Batman and Robin but by destroying things in the Secret Service of the Kingdom return to work with Olga Kurylenko acting as Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the prime minister seems to be more involved in the investigation of his fiancée claiming that he can solve all the tech problems in the UK: Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their most enjoyable journey: they make hotel crews, they set fire to a luxury French restaurant; they start a riot and enter without permission into the prestigious Volta boat; and English causes a cache when trying to use the upgraded Reality apparatus to study the interior of the Volta boat.
All the rest has undoubtedly been removed for the final series, but regardless of the influences and turmoil involved, there are many characteristics of children's periods in the film.
Make good ones.
And just as with other Johnny English films I had to think again: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes justice for his talent?
The Labour Party denied that it had a plan for the British to work for four days but was paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will focus on a tight plan that the British will work four days a week - but be paid five days.
The party is alleged to have asked corporate leaders to pay money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them an extra day.
It will mean employees will have three days to rest - but they will still be home with the same income.
Sources said the idea would "fit" the party's economic agenda and plans to strengthen the country for workers.
Working four days a week has been backed by the Workers' Union Center as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
The Labour Party's main source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but four working days are dedicated to the party's focus on balancing the economy for workers as well as the party's overall strategy for the sector.
The Labour Party would not be the first to propose such an idea, the Green Party promised four working days a week during its 2017 campaign for a general election.
However, it is not currently supported by everyone in the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "Four working days a week are not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Vice-Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour meeting to explain his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had a resolution to remove power from 'invisible directors' and 'rich' in service delivery companies.
The alternative Chancellor's plan also means that current shareholders in water companies will not be able to recover all of their funds because the Labour Government can make a 'loss' on the basis of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed that plans to put employees on corporate boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to provide 10 percent of private companies' funding to employees, who will have the opportunity to earn an annual share of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy Explains "60 Minutes" If FBI Investigations Against Kavanaugh Can Change Their Minds
The FBI's investigation into Justice Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised the question as to whether the FBI's findings could change the minds of Republicans in favor.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his counterpart from South Carolina.
I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I went to the trial, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him after this happened, when the allegations came up, I said, 'Did you do that?'
He was strong, honest, and trustworthy."
However, it seems that Graham's decision may not change.
I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh and he's going to take a lot of action," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently refused," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone involved could not confirm it.
It's 36 years now.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the role of the world's citizens and what has been done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens' Festival, a music event that includes an impressive list of stars singing as well as a similar interesting message; ending global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival will drive tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn area in the Central Garden not only to enjoy stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness with the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 World Citizens' Festival, which said it was a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people facing it directly.
To get a free event ticket (unless you would like to pay for a VIP ticket), festival supporters had to complete a series of activities, or "actions" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or any other efforts to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how has the world's population managed to achieve its goals in the last 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people for free concert tickets a real way to persuade people to push for action, or just another case of so-called "online activism" - people feel like they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, the World Citizen Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have pushed world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, at least $10 billion that have already been distributed or donated.
The group estimates the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and funders in the UK focused on "helping children reach their full potential," promising to donate €35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and World Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of not having a healthy diet just history," Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been completed in asking the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with quality nutrition.
In response to a question in the Questions and Answers section on her website she asked "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
The citizens of the People's Republic of China responded: It will be a long and arduous path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, when there were human rights activists and groups against racism in front of us, we would succeed, because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars to sing at the event in New York, which hosts Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. can use the Navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington could "if needed" use its navy to prevent Russian energy from being sold, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said, as stated by Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is to look for energy markets how they do in eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the officer, there are methods and methods to deal with it.
The United Nations has that capability, including our Marines, to ensure that sea routes are opened, and, if necessary, to prevent them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that says it represents "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare the ways that Washington uses to deal with Russia and Iran, saying that those countries are similar.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, in terms of spending and changing oil," he said, referring to Russia as "a few skilled" and a coal-based economy.
The information comes at a time when the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which has become a very affordable option for European consumers.
As a result, the Trump administration's leaders, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which according to Trump, made Berlin the "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the 11 billion-strong Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's opposition to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we believe that energy should not be a tool to make pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has been criticized by Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the German Confederation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (BDI) said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look deeply" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she could "look deep" if she ran for president after the election of representatives.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could focus on running.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government that includes women in power," she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will see if I can run for president.
Warren spoke to President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction."
I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren has been vocal about his opposition to Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said "we obviously need the FBI's investigation before we vote."
A study released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of voters in Warren County do not feel he should run in 2020.
59 percent of voters in Massachusetts said senators should not run, according to the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Policy Research.
Thirty-two percent supported such a move.
The study showed more support for the candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 percent in favour and 48 percent in favour.
Other well-known names for Democrats considered to be more likely to be running include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks of the horrors of Track Palin's meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, I can understand other families that are going through the effects of stress and some of the trauma that our troops are returning with," he told a rally at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to her as a "barbarbarous thing" and said that her son and other soldiers of war were "coming back in a different way, returning with a hard faith, returning to wonder if there is respect for the land and the space and every other military ally, for his commitment to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence to a woman and compromised reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons when drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support new immigration policy
Eighty states and the District of Columbia support legislative opposition to a new U.S. policy that prohibits asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories submitted a small statement of friend-of-the-court on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in opposition to the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. case against Sessions which was presented by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union held in August against the country's policy has not been revealed.
He said his partner "with his accomplices of the criminal group," but U.S. officials denied his request for refuge on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Lawyers for pro-Grace countries described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which provide the largest number of asylum applicants in the United States, as states struggling with organised crime groups and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the U.S. changed the 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to be granted asylum.
Columbia District Attorney Karl Racine said in a Friday statement that the new policy "reasons decades of state, state and international law."
The country's law requires that all claims of refuge be determined according to the facts and circumstances of the claim, and the denial violates that principle," the court said in a statement.
More lawyers said in a statement that a policy prohibiting immigrants from entering the U.S. economy negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide essential services."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer seek refuge in victims of domestic violence and organised crime groups in June.
The refuge is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement about the policy.
The act of granting asylum was not intended to solve all the problems - even all the major problems - that people face every day around the world.
Many rescue efforts in Palu as the number of disasters doubles in the race for survivors,
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
It looks very bad," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her baby with a fever at a rescue centre in the city of Palu.
Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not easy."
Residents seemed to be returning to their destroyed homes, taking water-drained equipment, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured as hospitals, destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, failed to control the number of patients.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, buried him outside the Pallu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to future earthquakes.
Tears filled her eyes as she recalled how a powerful earthquake shook a room on the fifth floor of the hotel where she was with her wife and daughter.
There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the rubble of the walls, I think," Harris told Associated Press, adding that her family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then she became silent.
I don't know what happened to him and his son.
I hope you're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of "abuse" by "promoting propaganda"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper made a four-page announcement in a U.S.-China joint newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. journalists to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China's paid addition to the Des Moines Register - the most-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. election on November 6, a claim China has rejected.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election shows what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's accelerated campaign to push China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to set up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently struggling in a trade war that has led to an increase in each other's tariffs.
China's early retaliatory tariffs on trade were designed to affect foreign exporters from states such as Iowa that backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, China's top exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing had negatively affected U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment piece at Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now reduces the violence by placing propaganda ads on independent media."
In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a method that is sponsored by the U.S. free speech and free information by placing ads paid on Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
In comparison, in the local newspapers in Beijing, you'll find very few voices expressing opposition and you won't be able to see the reality and the different views that the Chinese people may have with regard to China's struggling economic goals, given that the media are closely controlled by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper he did.
The Republican Party has banned women from voting in the run-up to the election by using Kavanaugh's crisis, analyst Warn
With many supporters advocating for a nominee at the High Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of a number of allegations of sexual harassment, analysts have warned that they will get negative results, especially from women, during the election of representatives.
The sentiment around this has been very high and many Republicans have openly indicated that they wanted to go ahead with the vote.
Such things cannot be reversed," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he was concerned that last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI investigation would be enough to cool voters.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and even all of November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and spokesman for the MovementOn National Development Group.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee as they chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mick reported.
The influence and influence of Democrats have exceeded expectations," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
People say they have reached a high level; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among women voters in neighborhoods and small voters, aged 18 to 29, who when they don't like the president, they often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public evidence describing sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said the negative results could follow if Republicans continued to prove it.
This has been a mud game for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote or the last vote or if Kavanaugh is elected, it's also about the way Republicans have dealt with this and how they treated him," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, said at a news conference.
However, Americans seem to have some reservations about who's reliable after Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with many relying on Kavanaugh.
A new study from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are definitely or perhaps believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said it was obvious or perhaps believed in Kavanaugh.
Further, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was wrong or perhaps lied at the time of his testimony, while only 30% said the same in relation to Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under an oath last week that Kavanaugh abused him at the age of 17.
Ramirez said the High Court nominee revealed his secret parts when he attended a ceremony at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Innovator Plans to Start a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, launches a new business that will provide competition against Facebook, Amazon and Google
The technology giant's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that is being developed through the Berners-Lee Open Source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and people who are allowed access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast, Berners-Lee claimed that the purpose of Inrupt is to "rule the world."
We've got to do it now," he said.
It's a historic moment.
The software uses Solid technology to allow people to create "online personal data storage" or POD.
It can include a list of contacts, a list of things to do, a calendar, a library of music and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify both available on the same browser and at the same time.
And the unique about the storage of personal data online is that only the user can access what kind of information.
The company refers to this as "personal empowerment through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring in the right resources, process and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some of the developers tasked with creating this project and a dedicated community of code developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own one-of-a-kind applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to "Facebook and Google about whether or not they should introduce a comprehensive change where all their business models would be merged into one night."
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial and environmental energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Alliance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has contributed more to the debate of having a free website.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain Associate and Director of the World Wide Web, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
I'm very optimistic about this period of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victor Cross Award-winning priest during WW1
The only British priest to win the Victoria Cross award during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Col. Lutena Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
However, he was killed by a target raider four days later and never realized that he had won the UK's highest military award.
A commemorative stone has been unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "surprising example" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years from his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Col. Lutena Vann led his squad along the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and a sharp fire from the field and a gun."
He then rushed to the shooting line and with "greater courage" led the line to go ahead before using a field gun alone and focused on three weapons.
Colonel Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German warlord on October 4, 1918 - more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "acts that I know I can't achieve but very interesting."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honored to participate in the parade" and added "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support of many."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but found Peppa Pig instead,
Imagine this, you've waited all night to watch Bellator 206 but only refused to watch the main event.
Bill from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was broadcast live all night across the UK via Channel 5.
At 12 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, audiences in England were left open when the show was turned into Peppa Pig.
Others were frustrated after being alerted to the early hours of fighting.
A fan on Twitter described changing and placing a children's cartoon as "some kind of terrible joke."
It's a government regulation where by 12 a.m. the content was inappropriate so it had to change the software to be child-friendly," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the transmission.
Peppa the pig, "Yes."
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they would be working on their schedule to include the UK audience in the future.
I think when I think about the repeat, I think we can probably focus on this," Coker said.
But now it's at 12 a.m. on Sunday and we can't focus on this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're keeping it.
Believe me, when it changed there was a lot of messages that were sent and it was not good.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a government issue.
I can assure you that this will not happen in the future.
We're going to put it in five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to make an effort for the fans but we failed.
This is an unexpected situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'downright' because of his gender
Olympic champion Tom Daley says he felt depressed because of his gender throughout his career - but that gave him the motivation to succeed in life.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize it until he attended high school that "I realized that not everyone was like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs produced by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
She says that the decision to become a parent made her less focused on winning the Olympic Games.
The producer of a long-standing period, Kirsty Young, has been out for some time due to illness.
Sharing as a separated person in the first episode of Laverne, Daley says she felt "some deficiencies" more than everyone of her age because "it was socially unacceptable to love girls and boys."
He said: "To date, those feelings of self-esteem and some shortcomings, and feeling different from others are things that have given me strength and ability to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when they finally discovered his gender.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games has been a prominent member of the LGBT support campaign and was used by the Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to consider homosexuality a crime.
She said she came forward because she felt privileged to be able to live without impact and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he had fallen in love with another man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unexpectedly found him."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age gap has never been a major issue.
When you're going through a lot of things at a very young age" - he went to the first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced such things.
The couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
If you asked me last year, I just thought 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not agree that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they still had their Olympic tickets in London in 2012 - because he wanted to be the front row.
I couldn't tell him 'you can't go near that line'," he said.
I had grabbed her hand when she stopped breathing and I had to stop breathing completely and I thought she had failed," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I just knew that this was what I had lost my entire life - diving in front of a crowd of our people at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired her first song - Proud performed by Heather Small - which had inspired her during the Olympics preparations and made her excited.

Mickelson, who has been playing well, was placed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to improve his game so that he doesn't get to that point with no luck.
Mickelson, playing in the double event a year and keeping a record of 12 times, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a pair game.
Instead of being at the depth of the event, as he was often to the United States, this five-time major Cup winner divided his day between being a fan and practicing the game in the hope of fixing his problem.
He is never a leader even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for the game at Le Golf National Stadium, where bad football is punished from time to time.
And if the field isn't good enough, Mickelson, in his ninth match on Sunday, faces England's Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind as they start a single 12-man match, have a strong opposition, Mickelson's match can prove to be quite significant.
Furyk showed courage in his man, not that he could say more.
He fully understood his role today, greeted me and embraced me and assured me that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
He is very brave in his ability.
He is a great player and has been a great help to the team over the past few days and this week.
I've never played two games.
I expected him to play more, but that's what happened and that's how we thought we should focus.
He wants to be there playing, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most matches at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be his end in playing Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal quality record.
Mickelson has won 18, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought some benefits to the team.
He's a player, brave, passionate, loves to entertain people and is a good person to have in the team," she said.
I think the young players were also very happy to face him this week, which was great to see.
It's more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows how many points lead can be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a great leadership coming into the last days of the Ryder Cup can turn into a stressful journey.
The debtor made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the team led by Sve Ballesteros with five points against the Americans but ended with a hot draw, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but very close," said Bjorn, pictured after watching Class 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night leading 10-6 in Le Golf National.
So history points to me and everyone on the team that the game is not over yet.
You're going to be stronger tomorrow.
Go there and make sure you've done the right thing.
This game ends until you get the score.
We have a goal and we are trying to win this trophy and that is what we are aiming for.
I have said this all the time, I focus on 12 players who are in our team, but we know well the quality of the opposing team - the best players in the world.
In a statement, Bjorn said: "I wouldn't be more optimistic about this.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Tomorrow is a personal decision, and it's a different one.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are pleasant, but when you're out there alone, then you've been thoroughly tested for all your abilities as a golf player.
That's the message you need to tell the players, it's to do your best tomorrow.
Now, you let your partner go and do the best for yourself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, captain Jim Furyk hopes his players will do better on their own compared to when they played as partners, except Jordan and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Fury himself was involved in the most popular games in the last day, after being part of the winning team at Brookline before finishing with a defeat when Europe suffered a "Medina Miracle."
I remember every word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had brought his players together to the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get a good start as in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that speed goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those medium matches.
We planned our players successfully and put people in the way we felt we liked, you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the fight and tackle Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and other Ian Poulter in the European team in the top half of the list.
I went with this group in this order because I think it reflects all the journey," Bjorn said in his choice of players in a personal game.
Germany's new warship has been re-launched
Germany's newest navy ship was set to be launched in 2014 to replace the oldest ships used in the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to poor systems and increased costs, media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, a military spokesman.
The ship was to be joined by the Navy in 2014, but issues of later delivery affected the fate of this giant project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg warships that the Navy commissioned in 2007 came to replace the Bremen warships.
It is known that they will include power cannon, a layer of anti-aircraft and naval missiles as well as secret technologies, such as curved radars, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important components include maintenance after a long period of time - it is possible to send the new ships to two years away from home.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the high-level warships - which are said to allow Germany to focus abroad - are already outdated when they come into force, Die Zeit said.
The F125 came to prominence last year, when the Germans refused to launch the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Vos shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Marines had returned the ship to the ship's builders after delivery.
Not much is known about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to a number of "critical software and hardware flaws" that made ships less important if deployed in combat.
Deficiency in the programme was an important factor because the Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet will be powered by 120 sailors - only half of the crew on the former Bremen ships.
Also, it happened that the ship has extra weight which reduces its performance and limits the sailors' ability to improve the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000-ton fleet is believed to have twice as much weight as the ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also a major issue.
It is said to amount to 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing the new fleet are particularly important given the warning that Germany's naval capabilities have declined.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the raid was "going to miss ships capable of being sent to war."
The official said the issue had been ignored for a long time, because the old ships were removed but no alternative ships were issued.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-type ships would be used by the Navy.
The National Trust's mission is to save the lives of people
A new study conducted in the area in the Scottish Highlands aims to explain how bats use the environment in hunting their foods.
You expect these results will provide new information regarding the characteristics of these unique flying animals and help guide future conservation activities.
A team of scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will follow a variety of pipistrelles and soprano bats as well as a long ears bat and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special records will be placed in key locations around the area to monitor the activity of bats all season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct a phone survey using handheld diagnostics.
Sound analysis for the expertise of all records will confirm the repetition of sounds of bats and species that do so.
Environmental maps and reports will be provided to create a detailed photo-illustrator environment for their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will show which environmental sites are the most important for bats and how they are used by each species of bats.
This information will help determine the benefits of environmental management work such as the creation of pastures and the best ways to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically in the last century.
They pose a threat from building work and development that affects nests and habitat loss.
Wind and lighting tabs can also pose a risk, as well as pest-killing equipment and some building materials chemicals products, as well as attacks on pets cats.
Bats are not particularly poor.
However, due to their hunting behavior at night, their ears are more important than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use complex area-based techniques to target pests and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens 76,000 hectares of land across the country, focuses on bats very seriously.
It has trained ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, nest checks and sometimes save bats.
The organization has even established the first and exclusive reservoir of bats in Scotland on the property of the Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where it is home to eight out of ten species of bat in Scotland.
David Thompson's manager said the property was the best spot for the bats.
Here at Threve we have a huge area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all beautiful environments.
But there is a lot about bats that is not yet known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking the presence of bats before making repairs into the property because it is possible for unconscious damage to it can kill up to 400 young bats and possibly destroy the entire number of bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Society for the Conservation of bats, has urged the public to intervene and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats because most of our species do not know how many species are left."
Ronaldo has denied allegations of rape while lawyers are planning to sue the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "want to declare themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the indictment.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have later paid him $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reports as "fake news."
No, no, no, no.
What they said today, the fake news, "five times the winner of the Ballon d'Or prize says on camera."
They want to be known by my name.
It is common.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm happy and I'm okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are seeking to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they said were "unacceptable reports of suspicion in the privacy area," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages based on the seriousness of violations, which could be one of the biggest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at Hotel and Casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reportedly returning to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him in the background, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that by "99 percent" he was "a good man" who was "just one percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that he had had sex, but it was voluntary.
Mayorga also said she went to report to the police and was filmed of her injuries at the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court compensation because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was concerned about "public embarrassment."
The 34-year-old says she is ready to cancel the compensation because she is still struggling with the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the claim, and this season he moved to Italian champions Juve when he was bought for £100m.
Brexit: Britain will 'stop forever' by losing car manufacturers
Britain will "suffer forever" for losing its position as the world leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, Commerce Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a contract it would suspend for production time at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal," Clark said.
A Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays if no deal after Brexit would lead to job losses.
Burnaston Factory - which manufactures Auris Toyota and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year where 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union in March we will see a halt to production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's general director at Burnaston.
Some car manufacturers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade would work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main issues related to what developers say are the risks of supply in the event that there is no agreement after Brexit.
Toyota's production is carried out on a "right-time" basis, with equipment reaching every 37 minutes from retailers in the UK and the European Union for imported vehicles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border that the sector says could lead to delays and logistical shortages.
It is impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so the production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the European Union was "appropriately planned to avoid the investigation at the border."
We need to have a plan. We want a better agreement that will allow not only success at the moment but also take advantage of it," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from not only Toyota but other developers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue to get the supply that has been successful in the past.
Toyota could not say the time to stop manufacturing, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would reduce factory competition and ultimately job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a United Alliance member at the factory, said his associates are increasingly worried: "In my experience once these job vacancies leave they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a proper and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be delayed again, the White House says.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "retired for another week" as the fight over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel David Mueller, who investigates election interference with Russia, the relationship between Trump and Russian aides and possible obstruction of justice with the president.
Whether or not Trump will seek a job as deputy attorney general and thus risk Mueller's freedom, it has fueled speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire harness to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, saying he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was set to take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would "defend" not to sack Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with a trial at the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual assault, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, leading to a delay in the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "The date for that is not set, it could be this week, I can see that resulting in a week-long backlog of things in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see what happens with the media reporting.
Other journalists could have objected: Sanders has not hosted a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information is not due to "interesting attention," though he said: "I don't want to disagree with the fact that they attract attention."
He then said that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
The president holds more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding: "We've looked at those figures.
The press release will continue," Sanders said, "but if the media has a chance to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, that's far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often and you've seen it more in the last few weeks and that this will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump responds frequently to questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in open meetings or meetings with foreign leaders.
Meetings and media are rare.
In New York this week the president probably showed why, by giving a random speech and sometimes appearing in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to European Union staff at Scotland's Health Agency on Brexit fears
The Health Minister has written to European Union staff working at Scotland's Health Agency thanking the country and expecting them to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter with six months to Britain's departure from the European Union.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of housing conditions for EU citizens working in its public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over withdrawal continue, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also improving its preparations for an impossible situation to resolve.
I know this is a very exciting time for all of you.
That's why I wanted to mention how much I appreciate every employee's contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from across the European Union and beyond, bring relevant experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health care work, and help patients and the communities we serve.
It's your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's match against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He came to the edge and just grabbed it," Reed said.
Doctors and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before putting him on the stretcher for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV show in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details about the type/level of pain yet" and the state of Tennessee is trying to identify when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a first-class student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five confrontations on Saturday before leaving the game, which increased the total number of confrontations in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp duty when they buy in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be paid a high stamp duty to buy goods in the UK with additional funds being used to help homeless people under the new Tory scheme.
The move aims to balance Corbyn's success to attract young voters
An increase in stamp duty will be paid to those who do not pay their tax in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to earn up to $120 million annually - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK - and additional funds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to balance the success that Jeremy Corbyn has had in order to attract young voters to a pledge to provide affordable housing and target high-income people.
An increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay their taxes in the UK, with additional funds being used to improve the government's plan to combat homelessness.
The additional charges - which include the current stamp duty, including the highest rates imposed two years ago on second homes and rental homes - could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to pay up to $120 million annually.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-UK residents, resulting in price increases making it difficult for first-time buyers to buy their first home.
Many of the richest parts of the country - especially in the capital - have become "soul cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes a week after Boris Johnson applied for a discount on stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of putting the prices of goods high by buying farms and failing to ask Ms. May to drop house taxes in order to fix the "shame on the housing sector" of the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of sweeping changes to housing reforms, including tax controls to end the state's eviction "unmistakably".
He also wants to give them more power to build a new house.
Ms May said: "Last year I wanted to commit to restoring the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means changing our ruined residential sector.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and start a new life.
However, it cannot be fair that it is easier for people who do not live in the UK, including foreign companies, to buy housing at the same price as hard-working residents in the UK.
For so many people the dream of owning a home has been a long way off and there is a lot of potential for homelessness."
Jack Ross: "My final decision is to become Scotland's boss"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "final" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the challenge of reviving the North-East club, now in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this season after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish League last season.
I wanted to play my country as a player.
I was able to get the country team B game and it came to that," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and I was always impressed by the thing.
However, that opportunity will only come, if I succeed in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss says he was not afraid to follow the popular names at such a big club, after rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success at this point will be measured by 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the design and equipment in this club, of course it should be in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to return, but I just want to see if I'm successful here if I can get the club back up."
Ross is only three years old since he started his management career, after a period as a manager assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa from relegation to the third and changed St Mirren from relegation to winning the League Cup the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Maybe it was the real way," he recalled, taking over the management of Alloa.
I think it's better for me to play, than to play.
It seems strange because I did the same, I gained revenue from playing and enjoying the highest levels.
However, playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you should do every week.
I'm still dealing with this in terms of stress and pressure at work but I feel the management is fine.
I always wanted to be an administrator and now I do it, I feel even better in my entire life of being an adult.

The best time to get a drink is 11.30 pm on Saturday, research has found
The summer heat has increased drinking in Britain's struggling bars but has added more pressure to restaurants.
Bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase in July - but drinks in restaurants fell to 4.8 percent, the figures showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's trade advisor, which included the figures, said: "The development of the sun and Britain's more time-consuming participation in the World Cup meant July followed the same pattern as last month, when bars experienced a 2.8 percent increase, except that restaurants experienced even more impact.
A 1.8 per cent discount on the restaurant business in June went even further down in July.
The drinks were better than the drinks.
Food bars were affected in the summer, although they are not like restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out and get a drink.
Controlled bars saw a 6.6 per cent increase in sales for the month and food prices fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an entertainment and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue in the direction we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social events or sports are still the biggest factors affecting sales in the home market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 per cent per year is going to be very painful considering the ongoing cost pressures.
The long-term summer has come at the worst time for food service providers and we'll wait if the average temperature that we got in August will change things for the better."
The overall growth in sales in bars and restaurants, including new businesses, was 2.7 percent in July, compared to the decrease in brand products.
Monitoring sales in the Cover Peach Tracker industry for bars and restaurants collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups, containing a combined turnover of more than $9 billion and is a key factor in the industry.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some even 11 years old - have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents and teachers, the study reveals
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown growth in "Insta fake" pages
The news has led to fears that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they owned a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some even 11 years old - create fake social media accounts that keep secrets from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students has shown rapid growth in an "Insta fake" account - a reference to an Instagram image sharing site.
The news also raised fears that sexual content would be published.
Twenty percent of students said they created a "main" account to show parents, while also having other private owners.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's website found a young man encouraging others to "take me."
The Digital Awareness UK survey by the UK's Association of Independent Schools Teachers (HMC) found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two and half accounts of them agreeing to keep accounts private.
HMC Head Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many young people are being tempted to create online sites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish athletes
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish athletes as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's highest-paid athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading the game to benefit from his vast international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and World Athletics community and we are confident the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from participating in the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm interested in being the voice of athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
An American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among his four Olympic golds and is now an analyst at the BBC, failed to walk after suffering a lack of blood flow.
He wrote on Twitter: "One month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would only be known in time if I could recover and to what extent.
It's been a difficult task to recover fully, to learn again how to walk and today to make a repeat strike!
Thank you for the message of comfort!"
The announcement of a breast pump comparing mother to cow creates a different opinion on the internet
A breast pump company has shared online comments using an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers with judged cows.
To mark the launch of the so-called "the wealthiest breast pump in the world," consumer technology company Elvie released a music video to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers breastfeeding.
Four real mothers dance in a warehouse filled with cow's food for a song that includes words such as: "Yes, I get up, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't know these aren't my breasts."
The song goes: "Scratch out, act out, feed the children, act out, and catch my women."
However, an announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of views, the video has garnered different views from viewers and many say it reflects the "fear" of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
If we need to conceive and give birth to milk, unless their children are immediately removed after birth," one wrote.

Another said: "It bothers the mother and the baby.
Why don't you tell me about the mothers who are pregnant and their babies?
Another added: "A non-verbal announcement."
Others defended the announcement and one woman acknowledged that she felt the song was "shameful."
I think this is a very strong idea.
I would have found one if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like an animal.
It's a warning, but I understand.
This is a high-quality creative product," one wrote.
Another person said: "This is an exciting announcement that focuses on mothers who are milking (often in the workplace or on the street) and feeling like a "cow."
This is not an advertisement to praise or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video a group of women shows that they have all been playing with pumps on their veins.
The concept of the campaign stems from the knowledge that many women who use pumps feel like cows.
Elvie's pump, however, is quite silent, does not have cables or tubes and is quite fit within the diaries of breastfeeding and giving women freedom by moving, holding their babies and even going out when they are milking.
Ana Balarin, an associate and teacher of the ECD in Mother's Day said: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and inspiring launch.
Considering the parallels between describing women and dairy cows we wanted to put the practice of pumps to breast and all its challenges in the spotlight, while expressing in a way that is pleasing to the sense of freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elsie's pump has hit the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, one mother of two walked on the platform to architect Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children evacuated secretly to tent camp at the Texas border
The number of children detained has increased even though the number of people crossing the border has not changed, as the policies and policies put in place by the Trump administration have made it difficult to put children in donor care.
Usually, many donors have become unregistered immigrants and are afraid of risking their ability to stay in the country by continuing to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when the country's authorities announced that potential donors and other adult housewives would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Parliament that the agency had arrested several people who had asked to fund children who were alone.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have criminal records before.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are donor or family members are in the country illegally and most of them are foreigners.
So we continue to follow those people," Mr. Albence said.
In a move to process children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules that would require some of them to be filed in court within a month after the arrest, rather than 60 days, which was customary in the past, according to housing workers.
Many will be presented via a conference call via video, rather than the person in question, to apply for their case to the legal status of the immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for the aid will be sent back to their home country quickly.
The longer a child remains in detention, the more likely it is to be anxious or discouraged, which can lead to feelings of violence or attempts to escape, according to housing workers and reports that have emerged from the system several months ago.
The lawyers said these issues were on the rise in major centres such as Tornillo, where a child has a weak state, due to its size.
They added that transferring children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them emotionally or interacting with friends the last time could increase the trauma that many are already experiencing.
Syria calls for an immediate withdrawal of the so-called "United States, France and Turkey"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, though it has now been eight years of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are in Syria illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with accordingly."
They should leave immediately and without conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "the fight against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this holy war until we can save all of Syria's territory" from all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in a war-torn country.
In terms of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for them to return and blamed the "Western" for "spreading false fears" that led refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the recovery process," he said.
They put politics in the context of human rights.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no support for building Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevents the attacks of Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
Moualem however stressed that the deal had "a clear timeline" and expressed optimism that military action would help militants including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who will be "completed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is expected to hold the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be controlled "to examine the provisions of the current constitution," and to warn against interference.
Why Trump won the election for a second term
In that regard, Mr Trump will win the 2020 election again unless many progressives and reformers hope that the removal of power from power and scandals will end his presidency early.
It's "The Greatest End of the World!"
At present, there are no signs of fatigue of the viewer.
Since 2014, the rating of major times has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an estimated 2.4 million viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program leading in cable television ratings to 3.5 million viewers on a news night.
These are things that attract people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, producer of the ABC drama series "Designed Survivor," about a minister who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol's executive offices.
Nelly Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
He recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is a value in entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the story from Washington could later determine the case of Roe v. against Wade, as immigrant families can reconnect with the health of the global economy.
Self-esteem is only for those who have a lot of potential.
However, this issue overwhelms a conscious citizen as they approach the sixth hour of a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep" in the sources of his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a proud heavy garment," Washington Post said) and the result of Stormy Daniels' remarks about Mr Trump's body.
I've never seen Super Mario in the same way.
Part of what he does and makes it look like a real show is that it gives him something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and architect of "Pawn Stars," about Trump's show changing characters and themes every day (to kick-start a confrontation in the NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
You don't want to miss out on a period or stop.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, there was a 80-degree sunset outside his house in northern Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not leave there, not as Brett Kavanaugh is about to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's fate if it is not known.
I remember when we were doing all these amazing periods the past day and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.

Foreign currency is the closest choice of representatives of the European Parliament
It's no surprise that 17 Pennsylvania counties have experienced financial flooding, due to the renewed reliance on parliamentary districts that have found two current leaders vying for the same seat.
The newly formed district of Pittsburgh has a Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election for the latter of the spring season.
Lamb is contesting against someone else, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is the current leader representing the 12th oldest Pennsylvania district, which is widely spread by 17 new ones.
The maps were re-drafted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that ancient districts had been mapped to suit Republicans.
The 17 new contests have established financial competitions in the funding groups of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was a popular name in Pennsylvania after a small victory in a highly monitored March special election in the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Democrats say they have a better chance of winning.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for its support of China, and then abandoned it.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with little pressure to do so from Washington.
Mr Trump had a good meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the allies expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials in the Department of State decided to withdraw the U.S. diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with "the latest unrecognizable decisions of Taiwan," spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only observed against El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and visa application restrictions, would have a significant impact on the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As the internal meetings continued, North American and Central American leaders proposed a high-level meeting on security and economic well-being and followed a similar summit last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to go ahead and effectively put an end to any punitive consideration of El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration has placed on the gathering, diplomats said.
And three U.S. diplomats returned anonymously in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new sharp message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to provide details of the three U.S. leaders' discussions, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal talks without disclosing their identities.
Their views were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration and also spoke without disclosing the identity.
A study of history
The next shoe falling could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's possible obstruction of justice, where there is now considerable public evidence.
Mueller also directs his investigation into whether Mr Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in an attack on our election.
If Congress changes control, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability cases in the House, just as he is preparing to go again to vote for the voters and possibly the judges of his allies.
These are just a few of the things that are now possible and I do not say that the removal of Mr. Trump from power is inevitable - nor for leaders like him in Europe.
There are options that must be made with each side of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight is going on.
In 1938, German officials were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, just as the West would refuse to support and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years.
The course of history revolves around such changes and the stability of the democratic course is accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is currently undergoing a series of changes.
What will happen if Mr. Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a critical state since the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and said he was not fit to be in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' record is incorrect.
How can we respond if the FBI's new investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete and fair - or if he is proved to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in a parliamentary election that will not make Mr. Trump stand in the way of justice?
If we fail to meet these standards, democracy will face the risk of long-term decline.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the Nazi government which was once my home.
He survived, moved to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with a swastika sign.
With that as my legacy, how can I not have a positive outlook on our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers has a lot of hope ahead of the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians, after a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will keep them in a better position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use the result to establish a lot of things.
It was a good sign for us because Villarreal is a great team," said the 31-year-old.
We got into the game and thought we could get something and get back with a single score.
Maybe we could get more in the end but, in general, the draw was probably the same result.
They were probably the best in the first half and we went into the second half as the best.
It's another big day in Europe.
We hope, we can get all three points but it will be a tough game because they achieved good results in their last game but, with our fans behind us, I'm sure we can push and get good results.
Last year was very difficult, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes at the club but there is a good feeling about this place right now.
The team is the same as the players are very happy; your exercises are the same.
Hopefully, we can push now, forget last season and succeed."
Women do not get enough sleep because of fear of death.
Although it was true that the study participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their families about this.
About half of the people in a nationwide survey said they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
People want family members to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have a dialogue," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the Nationwide insurance business.
That's how a person starts.
Talking to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.
Collaborate with your consultant and your family to discuss where and how to receive services, because those options can be a key factor in determining costs.
Share your financial adviser: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a long-term insurance policy, a combination life insurance policy of monetary value in order to address these costs or rely on your wealth - the best you have money.
Use your legal documents: Block your legal proceedings in advance.
Get a medical care representative certificate so that you can nominate someone you trust to manage your medical care and make sure that the professionals obey your wishes if you can't communicate.
You can also get a lawyer's help in your case.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure your expenses are paid on time.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Do you have the ability to answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Keep these details in a written plan for you to be prepared.
It's not just money that matters, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Man shot multiple times by air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times by an air rifle as he walked home from a night entertainment.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Officials described the incident, which took place at 8:30 BST, as a "sudden act."
The victim did not see his attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have asked witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of casualties expected to rise.
With communication cut short, aid officials have been unable to get any information from the Donggala regime, north of Palu, which is close to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake disaster.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the important facts about Pallu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow stretch on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
It has been 40 years since the earthquake.
Donggala is a coastal kingdom of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The interim government, a regional administrative area, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the Sulawesi Central Region, especially the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but it is mainly found in abundance in Morocco, opposite the coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by an earthquake.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December left a tsunami struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, an island of most residents in Indonesia causing a tsunami that shattered the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentai, far from Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed several villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit the rule of Pidie Jaya in Aceh causing damage and fear as people remember the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami has occurred at this time, but more than 100 have been killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Sarah Palin's son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, son of Alaska's former governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when a female friend tried to call the police to report a crime, she took her phone.
Palin is detained at Mat-Su Case Center and on a $500 non-security bail, reported KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent, of course" when asked for his application, the website reported.
Palin is facing three misdemeanors at Level A, meaning she could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
Also charged with Grade B offense, the penalty is to be jailed all day with a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attacks.
The case is now in front of the Alaska War veterans court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing a domestic crime report and possessing weapons when he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His wife said he was crying.
Sarah Palin was criticised by warlords in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to the Stress caused by the horrific PTSD incident that followed her service in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake on Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks were disrupted and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the future.
The earthquake occurred just outside the central part of Sulawesi, which lies north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach concert in the city of Palu as the tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare unremarkable crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is alleged to have used the Home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists on its way to it in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious physical injuries, according to a statement of intent to seek the death penalty, issued in the Southern District of New York.
All these offences carry the possibility of a death sentence, according to a court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the country's jury ruled 22 charges against Saipov that included eight counts of murder with the help of fraud, usually used by state prosecutors in organised crime cases and the prosecution of violence and the destruction of vehicles.
The attacks needed to be "planted and properly prepared," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's act as "absolute, cruel and misleading."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York upheld the death penalty charges.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a New York case was in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a husband and wife convicted of spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Rosenberg was put to death on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan-born, showed a lack of regret days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded guilty to 22 counts of crimes.
David Patton, one of the country's public defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "disappointed" by the verdict of the charges.
We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only increase traumatic experiences for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's representative team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to "move the army of the people" today during a rally in Tory.
Former Ukip leader said politicians should 'feel warm' from anti-EU citizens - as one of Theresa May's lawmakers suggested she should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain should have been "out" at the moment if Mr Farage was to become Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces is the challenge of bringing her side to a deeply divided point when Tory supporters remain joined in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to implement his Checkers' deal amid criticism from Brexit supporters, who support Remain and the European Union.
His allies insisted he would move forward with a move to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite objections - and force opponents of the European Union and Labour Party to choose between his plan and "confusion."
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "stop the Chequers program."
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a partner and given the role of dialogue with Brussels.
If he had control, we would have been ready now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we need to forget the Checkers' plan.'
Expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in the world war to remain under others.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is not true at all."
Tory's pro-Brexit MP Andrea Jenkyns was also at a protest and told reporters: 'I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Checkers program is not very popular with the general public, the opposition cannot vote for it, it is not liked by our party and our activists who actually go to the streets and help us be elected.
Please join the Checkers program and start listening to people.
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers retain their positions as they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told a rally that politicians should be made to "feel warm" if they are about to betray a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we can't let him do that.'
In a message to the crowd, he added: "I want you to make our politicians, who are about to betray Brexit, feel warm.
We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that will give us victory in Brexit and that will never rest until we are free, independent, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, supporters continued to protest through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Many activists showed banners written to the Tories against Brexit after the group's launch at the end of this week.
Labour MP Mr. Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they faced in the party's program when the meeting was opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have all the IT systems and technologies of the United Kingdom and the European Union to respect the rules of the other, by a hassle-free border, for free trade in Ireland," he added.
It's a lie.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "look deep" to run for president,
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she plans to "seriously look forward to running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats spoke about its fate during a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against GOP Representative Geoff Diehl, who chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He has been at the centre of speculation that he will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's incident at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the town hall structure since Trump was elected.
He asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that involves a woman in the upper seat."
Man arrested in connection with the shooting of Sims LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that one suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 5 AM ET at a news conference.
They released a shooting video on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University early Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died from it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect the man when he was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing weapons and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained at the Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6 feet 6-to 6-year-old brought up Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games and started in 10 games in the last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rhythms per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is about to win the World Cup after team orders gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas got a good start and almost completely left Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack each other.
Vettel took the lead first and let Hamilton follow the traffic on the group's tail, which was something that had to contribute a lot.
Mercedes made one circuit and was behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a fierce competition that made Ferrari's driver leave the inner area free from the impact of closing after doing so twice at the third angle.
Max Verstappen began in the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held it and then passed on to Kimi Raikkonen to become the fourth.
He eventually reached his place of adjustment in the 14th round and failed to speed up eight runs in the same round, with Raikkonen taking fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job the whole weekend and showed maturity to let me go.
The team has done exceptional work to take the first and second place," said Hamilton.
It's a bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday on his insistence that he did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing the High Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead saying that what was going on in the Senate showed people were "wrong, wrong and false."
One thing that can happen and the good thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days, when you see angry and selfish and false people," he said.
When you look at the offers and disclosures then they say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you notice?
Do you remember the answer to your question, "What are you doing?"
No, it's not!
I didn't kill them.
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't say no," he added, adding.
Feinstein was sent a letter expressing charges against Kavanaugh and Ford in July and was revealed in early September - but Feinstein denied that it came from his office.
I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford. I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
He asked me to keep it secret and kept it secret as he prayed.
But his remarks did not seem to be received well by the president, who commented during a meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you this, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe it's not, but that's the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the High Court nominee, who is charged with sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their benefit.
They have the right to take power in any way.
You see greed, malice, care about who they are hurting, who have influenced them in order to gain authority and control," Mediaite reported the President as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars paid off a lost match against Belfast Giants on Friday in the Elite League by winning a 5-3 replay at Dundee on Saturday.
Giants took the early lead through two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalised the hosts before Dwyer gave the Giants the lead again.
Francois Bouchard equalled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals gave them a win.
It was the third game lost in the season to Adam Keefe, who came back to win the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time in a season between the two teams, with Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after securing the ball from Kendall McFaulll and David Rutherford gave him Beauvilier the ball to score the second goal four minutes later.
In an exciting first half, Sullivan equalised the hosts in the 13:10th minute before Matt Marquardt scored the Cownie 15:16 goal.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead before the first break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped with Bouchard once again and settled them in the 27:37th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played together to help Nielsen give Dundee a lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second half and ensure a fifth goal win in the final period.
Giants, who have now lost their last four games, will be hosting Millton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Flight Traffic Controller Dies While Ensuring Hundreds of Passengers on Planes Can Avoid Earthquake
Indonesia's air traffic regulator has been hailed as a hero after losing his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people has left safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and dozens missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Later earthquakes continue to occur in the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to escape from his position at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower.
He remained to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the road at the time, was able to fly safely.
Then he jumped to the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesman, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of people, Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our hearts are broken to hear about this," he added.
At the same time, the leadership fears that the death toll could reach thousands and the country's disaster relief agency has said that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is too limited.
The numbers are believed to still be rising as many bodies were still stuck under the falls as a challenge to reach many," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-metre high tides have destroyed the Pallu which will host mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring support and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the bodies.
Clean water is not easily available.
Small businesses are everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the victims but we don't know how things are.
This is already a disaster, but the situation may be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every transfer-related activity.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, in which more than 550 people died.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person has been lost after a plane crash inside the airport.
The airline, which currently owns a flight in the Mediterranean Sea in Micronesia, said one person had been missing, after it had previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely rescued when the plane sank.
The Air Niugini said in a statement that by Saturday afternoon, he could not know when he was a single man.
The agency said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to trace him.
The agency did not immediately respond to requests for further information regarding passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane crashed as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the series of incidents is still unknown.
The U.S. Navy and the U.S. Navy both said the aircraft landed in the water just before reaching the route.
Some people thought the plane had hit the road.
U.S. Senator Bill Jaynes said the plane was too low.
That's great," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others were able to walk through the water reaching the waist through the emergency doors of the plane.
He said the flight attendants were scared and screamed that he had a small wound on his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve the pier had also helped rescue by using a breathboat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet)
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows 111 people have died in plane crash registered with PNG over the past two decades but none have been responsible for Air Niugin.
A documentary about the night when a woman was killed
The prosecution concluded its case on Saturday in a retrial in which a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of mental analysis.
He showed a panel of judges how he used mobile phone records to link the activities of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the disaster.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis had Chambers in the evening of his death, contrary to his earlier claim, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed his mobile phone was with Chambers' when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford took a stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said they were in a Sanford car that night, Sanford said he "was lying, because my car was Nashville."
One of the most controversial statements was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for only two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted the phone messages and details of Chambers' contacts from his phone.
He's completely lost his life," he said.
The defense is scheduled to start its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be referred to the jury later that day.

They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop that brings about change.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently seen a new popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York home minister sues couple for being fired after "racist" message
A housemaid from New York is suing a couple for dismissing a job on the basis of discrimination after she received a message from a mother who complained she was "just another black man."
The couple refuses to be racist and contradicts those claims with "fraud."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern after finding out that the new baby care provider, Giselle Maurice, was a black man after arriving on her first working day in 2016.
No one else is black," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent Ms. Maurice, twice.
After discovering her mistake, Plasco -Flaxman "worried" sacked Ms. Maurice, saying that their departure attendant, of African-American descent, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing couples for compensation related to dismissal and wants $350 a day for the sixth month, for work to live and work, although without a contract.
I want to show them, look, you don't have to act like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's racist."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that stopping Maurice's work was the right move, fearing that they could not believe him again after he had wronged him.
My wife had sent me a message she didn't want.
He's not a bully.
We are not racists," her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But can you put your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it is by mistake?
Your little child?
Speak the truth."
Comparing the charges with "smuggling," Plasco said it was only two months after his wife had given birth and he was "in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to sue someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," the banker said.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has accused the couple on social media, attacking their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not be interested in the speaker's bear, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes reading for the first time before being published.
It's very interesting to know about the success of Paddock."
Saying his father, who worked as a camera serviceman at the BBC before getting inspired to write a children's book from a small bear game, would have had no ill-feeling for his work to be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "happy and sad" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes it as "the most important partner of our family," he added that his father was very pleased with his success.
He was a man with no words and no pride," he said.
But because Paddington was so important to her, it's like having a successful child: you're proud even though it's not your actions.
I think he saw the success of Paddock in that way.
Although it was his architecture and his imagination, he was always praising Paddistan himself."
My daughter died and I had to call her.
After discovering that her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
Nad was calling regularly and saying that the situation was very bad and he was not expected to live," said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me he would die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "My son, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her so that her soul would continue to beat were gradually fading in her system.
He had died a while before and this was just his system to stop working.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't cry or scream because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to encourage myself.
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers - without knowing what she was going through.
No one knew," he said.
I've been crying and crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's when I was on the plane I really liked Nad.
I needed love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved him."
Women wear a mask to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on the Welsh bridge for powerful messages and phone numbers that people can call.
His son, Davis, Tyler, was 13 when he started experiencing depression and suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a very optimistic cook and an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
Everyone said his smile was pleasing to all the people."
However, he left his job before he died, because he was "in a dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the first to find his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm always worried that this will affect others."
Ms Davis created a card, "enable people to know that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if they are friends.
Don't be silent - you need to talk."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old boyfriend, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say that he felt bad or was disturbed by the thought," she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was the lowest on Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he didn't want to look at them eye to eye or communicate."
He said his death had caused them trauma, but they had to work hard to continue life: "It puts a hole in the family.
It gives us a heart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future as FBI investigates
I thought, if we could find something like what he asked for - a time horizon, a scope of magnitude - maybe we could bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling away" from the rhetoric.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They are from time to time.
The election of representatives takes place only five weeks from now, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail too much, then they will be too weak in their bid to keep the person they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been making calls to senators, urging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats work.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to break the draw and prove him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee population "dropped" under Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said higher controls on the border between North Korea and China and higher levels of fines imposed on businesses selling people were the main reason.
Pyongyang did not give public opinion.
Most of the North's refugees are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many are fleeing through China, which has a much longer border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the area with many more troops (popular DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have changed dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on denuclearization.
The incident came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress since then.
Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will rid ourselves of nuclear weapons in the first place," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as "incapable of self-control," and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was "incapable of self-control" and said he had so many feelings he shouldn't serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune in Austin, Texas.
I thought that if it were a woman who had ever done it, they would have said "she can't control herself," Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were young.
At the time of his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes close to screaming and running out of breath talking about his family and his high school years.
He also openly denounced Democrats on the committee, citing the charges against him as "absolute and coordinated to destroy his reputation" designed by the angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he was not able to serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he discriminated against the Democrats.
I think he's stepping down because of those words and how he denounced Clinton's family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was not asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and if the Democrats would be the majority in the House of Representatives.
I will say this - if he is not telling the truth to Parliament or the FBI, then he should not only be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe's case against Wade, because she is said to be a conservative judge.
In his confirmation trial, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he could change some Supreme Court decisions.
It's not the time for an angry, racist to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women should use it.
It's a good review of bitters, months and years of much more wrath and can't get rid of them without crying.
We're crying when we're angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's normal, are you?
She continued, "I was really helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said she was also crying when she got angry, but she created a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she could tell someone who was talking to her," You might think I'm sad because I cried.
I was upset."
Then he continued to explain.
I thought it was a good idea."
Tears are allowed as a way to get rid of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most memorable memories from my early career, it's an office full of men, where I once found myself crying out in an irresistible rage, caught in the back part of the neck by a huge woman - the manager I was always a little afraid of - who pulled me to the stairs.
Don't let them know you're crying," he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy because of them."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked alongside Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was found to have an affair outside of a marriage boat known as Monkey Business and withdrew as a candidate, Ms. Schroeder was deeply disturbed and saw no reason not to be a presidential candidate.
It wasn't a good decision," he told me, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
He described it as "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign time had gone too far, he was behind in raising money and so vowed that he would not get into the race unless he raised $2 million.
It was a war he lost.
He found that some of his followers who donated $1,000 to men would only give him $250.
Do you think you're going to get a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech announcing that he could not launch an official campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotions - thanks to people who helped him, confused by a system that made it very difficult to raise money and target voters instead of angry voters due to gender discrimination - until he breathed his last.
You would think that I had a nervous disorder," she recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the media treated the incident.
You would think Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember, what would they put on my grave?
Did you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war can benefit Beijing
The initial voices in the U.S.-China trade war were particularly troubling and although the war will not end soon, differences between countries may have long been beneficial for Beijing, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump made his first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most impactful difference began this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (£150 billion), charging half of all imports to the United States from China.
Beijing has consistently retaliated, recently imposing a five to ten percent tariff on 60 billion US dollars of goods.
China has pledged to reverse the U.S. move, and the second-largest economy does not appear to be giving up anytime soon.
Making Washington a change means you should accept the terms, but publicly accepting U.S. pressure would be a great embarrassment for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its game well, trade war problems against the United States can help China long-term by reducing dependence on the two countries.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create an environment that can start a shift in the economy in any of its countries and risk more than others have previously thought," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the new U.S. Intelligence Center.
Syria "ready" for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria has said it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
Today the situation is more stable and safe from the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reorganize the affected areas in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions now exist to voluntarily return to refugees in a country where they were forced to flee because of terrorism and economic measures that affected their daily lives and their jobs.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the conflict began in 2011.
Six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moolem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he said he did not want the support or support from countries that supported terrorism.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after winning the US team with the final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National Stadium outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when Denmark captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had a hard time throughout the tournament, shot his first ball in the water in the 16th hole of the 3 holes, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian player Molinari played well in all his shifts and became 1 in 4 to 5-0 player since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 with the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's first-placed player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter who is likely to play his last game at the Ryder Cup.
A player in eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most successful European player in the competition with a score of 25.5 in his games.
I'm not crying, but I'm crying today.
It has been a challenging year.
Thank you to Thomas for appointing me and trusting me.
I'm very happy, happy to win the cup again.
What's important is the team and I'm happy I was able to help," said Garcia, who was impressed after the European win.
He is transferring his duties to John Ram, who defeated American Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single-man game on Sunday.
I feel incredibly proud, to win Tiger Woods, I was watching him when I was a kid," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
A staggering figure from one of the highest-level players ever has been, having won 14 titles and just being the second to do so after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was restricted all weekend to keep the ball part of the grass except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a very high level game in all competitions.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his side's underclass game, "I'm proud of these players, they fought.
There were times this morning when we had a lot of problems with the European teams.
We fought.
There's a lot of respect for Thomas.
He's a very good manager.
All 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with our US PGA federation and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 players and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to give up.
They took control of us."
Red Wave Statement: Rates fall in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission show a general decrease in Red Wave levels in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the commission (FWC), the redness of the sections has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier's Districts - which points to levels declining.
Red tide has spread about 130 kilometers of coastline from Pinellas in the north to Lee counties.
The tracts can be found 10 kilometers away from Hillsborough County, but in some areas compared to last week.
The red wave has also been seen in Pasco County.
Average temperatures off or along the coast of Pinellas County were reported last week, high and low levels off the coast of Hillsborough County, naturally at high concentrations in Manatee County, native to moderate levels in Charlotte County, native to high levels in Lee County and lower rates in Collier County.
Early breathing time continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week's outbreak was not reported in North Carolina.
