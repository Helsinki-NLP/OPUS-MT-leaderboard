Welsh MPs are concerned that they will "look like Muppets"
Some parliamentarians (AMs) were stunned by the proposal that they could be called members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans for the Parliament to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they may become subject to ridicule.
A parliamentary representative from the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name "raises with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
The MP from the Welsh Party of Wales (Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to change its name, but that the MWP could quickly turn into Muppet in the speech.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the MPs will be entitled will be on their own."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Council of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that encountered broad support for changing the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to what members of parliament would be called, the Committee was inclined to call themselves "members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
The MPs propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could bring in the headaches of the Speakers of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way parliament functions, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, MPs will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians vote on change of country name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name represents the acquisition of Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed the launch of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced as churches in Harlem battle for survival
The older people I spoke with said that there was a bar and a church on every corner in the past," Adams said.
There is no one or the other today.
He said the disappearance of bars was understandable.
People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly reside.
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and "will sooner or later be found again at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come when these churches will be completely closed will come sooner because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Church of Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white Methodist Congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
The black congregation that held worship nearby took possession of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving blacks.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but since the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Father David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called Carillon "the bells of poor people."
An expert who played on carillon in July used the second name: "cultural treasure" and "unnecessary historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon for 18 years at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors of construction works, some of which were brought by lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the parish's governing body made up of laymen, was written to the diocese in July because of concerns that the diocesan would "try to transfer costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of the construction works sent by the diocesan.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old while diving for lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for a lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then with the group he drove to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of the lobster caught, but then he realized that he was shouting, "You bit me!
Bite me!"
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!", Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The captain of the rescue team, Larry Giles, told a press conference that the shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and protect swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is becoming a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetic counters and engaging specialized sellers.
As part of the UK's massive entry into the beauty market worth £2.8 billion, which continues to grow alongside the drop in sales in the home market, larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 nationwide stores and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets try to use the space on shelves that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the size of the offer of cosmetics to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for specific brands like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume trader will try to use concessions at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets have to work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlet would look more and more like a department store as the supermarket chain seeks to resist affordable stores such as Aldi and Lidl offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats departments, since two years ago he bought both chains, which he claimed encouraged the sale of food and made these acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to freshen up their cosmetic and pharmaceutical products departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury’s entered a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacy revenues in his supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business in the 281 stores of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for GBP 125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We have also invested in special training of colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination to buy cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "raised" after Holly Willoughby dropped a £11m contract
Dragon's Den Peter Jones star left to "cook with rage" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby dropped a £11 million contract with his brand to focus on her new deals with the Marks & Spencer store chain and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
Their brand was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon’s Den show star Peter Jones to cook from anger by retiring from a joint profitable business at the last minute to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "rapid" when a golden girl on television during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new £1.5 million contracts meant there was not enough time left to devote to their brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
This business was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would provide it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a lot of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that due to the departure of the show's host, one of the UK's most cost-effective stars, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes, and the possibility of further delaying the launch of the line.
And that could mean the end of many years of friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend their vacations together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of ITV's I'm a celebrity show.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Tough negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get in the newspaper over comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and because he has such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so many concessions?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
I didn't give any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed the "appropriate reaction" of the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the U.S. still did not lift sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the rally.
We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
We were threatened by war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – a break in missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of the remaining US troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena to enter, we'd have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not asking for international help, so it's all a bit of a problem," said Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pale, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disasters Office, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in assistance efforts.
Given the constant tremors of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although the shelters in the case of tsunamis are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastal line.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in place, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time traveling between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's crumbling structure was the foundation of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and new elections are taking place next year.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating the Premier League against Chelsea on Saturday at the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from goal Chelsea at a score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He moved the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaja Arrizabagaja, who jumped towards it and entered the net.
It was difficult to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and just touch the ball once, I didn't think too much about it and I just shot it.
Chelsea led with 1:0 in the half after the hit by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blue striker passed the ball back to Mateo Kovačić during that match before turning somewhere in the middle of the field and running to Liverpool's half.
Kovačić made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
He then directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in a net on the opposite tripod next to Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday at Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 o'clock on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the state disaster office said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people were trapped in the ruins of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that was felt on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews Street, John, and a 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hogan said: "The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to speak to us, and they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who thought they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said a notification procedure was underway for the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one should enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours until they can return to their apartments.
The police officer reportedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the housing block.
Anyone who has any information has been asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, referring to log 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of a debate on "removing history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupidity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's Society, said: "In the debate currently being held regarding the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace would become the subject of discussion.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the 19th-century way of thinking and part of the history of a person that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, to be the defender of parliament against external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as a patron of the Lord are still worth honoring and marking."
Swine killer kills Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, the pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead and covered with blood near a barn in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, on Sunday.
The pig breeder was about to vaccinate pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, China's Qinghai province.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the door to the next piglet was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeder to death.
Guiyang's evening news said that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else while the police were collecting evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market management are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig pinned a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After pigs were eaten by farmers in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playful.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remains bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As announced, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flood rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States over the coming days.
Rosa blew 140 km/h east of the time, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is created over the Pacific and moved to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the approaching low pressure area will cause severe precipitation in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential floods, mud torrents and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain as much as 25 to 100 mm in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There may be torrential flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go to the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and thunder showers will bring local storm winds and dusty germination.
Approaching a low-pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of the coast of southern California.
Rainfalls of more than 12 mm are possible, which can cause less mud torrents and slippery roads.
It will be the first precipitation in the wet season in this region.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning before covering a wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the border areas of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah on Tuesday and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, major temperature changes are possible across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to rise and re-expand.
It is expected that in most central and eastern United States the beginning of October will be warm with 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 80s.
Meanwhile, a political showdown continued, with reporters interrupting a regular program to notify the reversal at the last minute of Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate panel that she was completely certain that Kavanaugh was in a drunken state touching her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his eager testimony that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in Nielsen's report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate number of viewers available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually also has difficulty measuring the number of people watching the content in the offices.
To give you a better idea of that, it's an audience that's similar in number to the one watching American football playoffs or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning filmed demonstrators shouting at him as he tried to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, there was a shot-down look as the demonstrators shone at him in front of CNN's live cameras.
I'm standing here in front of you," one woman said.
Do you think he is telling the truth to this country?
They said to him, "You have power while so many women are helpless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement even before the elevator door closed to say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were monitored live when the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as required by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then several more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's accusations.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the UK and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers Brexit plan in a second interview with her on the front page, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties is "complete nonsense".
Wayde Sims Assassination: Dyteon Simpson Arrested for LSU Player's Death
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and detained on negligent charges, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses in the conflict.
Police found glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A $350,000 bail was requested.
On Friday, the coroner's office of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for their "persistence and pursuit of truth."
Sims was 20 years old.
A 183 cm tall wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano dumps ash into Mexico City
The ash that ejects the volcano Popocatapetl has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center was accompanied by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have observed increased volcanic activity located 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude quake shook central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence advocates clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined counter-emergency demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists prevented by the police began to shoot at police officers with powdered eggs and paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later in the day when the police used batons to calm the fight.
Over the course of several hours, groups advocating for independence chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and against them Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstration, the local press reported.
Tensions in an independence-seeking region have not subsided even a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal and that Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the turnout was small, as those who boycotted the vote against the secession were mostly.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured in fierce clashes last year after police tried to stop holding votes in polling stations across the region.
Groups pushing for independence spent a night on the street on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the demonstrations of the separatists along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite achieving a crucial, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have been struggling to maintain momentum this year as their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both sides.
The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
The candidacy for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crashing into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after crashing into a Londonderry house several times.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the courtyard doors and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow from a crossbow was fired on the car.
Menge hit Livingston victory over Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston won
The Scottish Premier League's new club Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to concede his second defeat of 18 matches at the head of the club from the Ibrox stadium.
Dolly Menge's goal proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a victory at the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they are playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league they are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his winning streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not been defeated since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that goal, as their directness in the attack caused a whole range of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on his way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only broadly point the ball after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the guests
And that's how the key goal was scored.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston designed the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi together, who hit the middle of the goal.
By that time, the Rangers had mostly control over the ball, but faced impenetrable domestic defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of work.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Rangers Allan McGregor's goalkeeper's legs have come to a standstill with Scott Pittman, and Lithgow has made a broad blow from another organized Livingston attack.
Long additions failed to cross the goal line of Livingston, and no two elevens were awarded – after Halket's confrontation with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for playing with his hand.
Great" by Livingston - analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, thus continuing to exceed expectations on this entry path.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at leading an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a break throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerrard.
They only once opened a hole in the home team, and that is a kind of call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan greeted with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They diverged on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of supporters from the president came to see him showed up nearby.
And hundreds of anti-Erdonian demonstrators – many of them Kurds – raised their voices by condemning Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the divisiveness caused by a visitor whom some German Turks hail as a hero and others attack as an autocrat.
Road collision in Deptford: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on a road with heavy traffic in Deptford, in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred several months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver's escape from the crash site at Chiders Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads were closed and bus traffic was diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison.
Riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
The Tornado Special Forces were brought in to combat riots involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
On-site police officers were given assistance for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been hired to resolve the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received assistance for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make it clear that everyone responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend a long time behind bars."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison administrator had ended up in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential floods (possible benefit for arid areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but this is what is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest with its remaining power and brings the risk of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about torrential flooding for Monday and Tuesday in the area from West Arizona, through South and East Nevada, South California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is due to approach Phoenix late Monday with rain and cross it straight on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that "since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have brought tropical storms or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) is 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm at the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert south-west, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with possibly isolated total amounts of up to 100 mm.
For those out of the danger of torrential floods, Rosa could come as a rescue because the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a major danger, some of these precipitations could be beneficial because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought map, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category," the weather.com said.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican Baja California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm came across the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
The rain on parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
The amount of total precipitation expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm,” the weather.com said.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential flooding and mud in the deserts and landslides on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton an injured teenager was found.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police Department said the 17-year-old, 2 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police officials have called for everyone who has a recording of the event to come forward.
Trump Claims Kavanaugh Suffered Violentness and Rage From the Democratic Party
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally dismissed Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charge she made.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage on that day.
The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with a flawless public service career," he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of Republican elections in the middle of his presidency.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I actually am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats' mission was to "create resistance and obstruction."
The assistant Republican leadership told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and numbers continue to rise
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had been killed, many of which were dragged away by huge waves hitting the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when waves of up to six meters high hit the shore, dragging many of them to death and knocking everyone down on their way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately and they were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
Cunami didn't come alone, he dragged cars, trunks, houses, he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, crooked and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday matched the twin-power atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been demolished.
He also said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped beneath the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications have been completely disrupted and we have no information from Donggal.
More than 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had moved to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for not providing information that the tsunami hit Palo, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of the building panicically warns people down the street about the impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
The Reuters agency could not confirm the authenticity of the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused a disruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, cargo planes began to be dispatched with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuations still needed food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggale successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where employees were sheltered in tarpaulin tents placed in the courtyard of their office, they forwarded the scenes of destruction along the way," Mr. Dosba said.
They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups launched the wheels of help in the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise were prevented from coming to Pale.
Under Indonesian law, funding, supply and hiring of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "OK, it's a national disaster," we can receive international help, but that situation has not yet been declared."
When the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fell on Pal on Friday, friends and families of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that ease the black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian National Paraglider Team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his disciples.
Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after news of the demolition of the Roa Roa Hotel that spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu contests that took part in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray tick, instead of two blue ticks.
I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee on Friday morning, charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, Newport Police Department said in a statement.
In a statement, Detective Dennis McCarthy said that the driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man "came in the race to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole a bag of money that needed to be put in the ATM.
Witnesses noticed several suspicious people fleeing the scene of the theft, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday announcing the change, he wrote the following: "The living entity officially known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year in a conversation about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
It started from Kanya, which means “the only one”, to just Ye – it is a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is a reflection of who we are."
He is one in a series of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West associate, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without a dash and with a dash and in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday promised to "never use the army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people when left-wing student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Artificial Intelligence Investment (AI)
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it invests in research in the field," said Kai Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment came after different parts of the US government announced plans for AI, although the US lacks a formal AI strategy in principle.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in AI innovation by 2030.
A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the United States and that we are looking for the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A double increase in investment could double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence will come in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s, Carnegie Mellon worked on an AI system that beat the best American player of the game, Othello, and later served as director of the Microsoft Research Department and chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous technology competitions by the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next visionaries would be held.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
It's not China that leads academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the United States boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I think that artificial intelligence PhD students should be offered green cards automatically," he said.
The China State Council published the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to the National Foundation for Science and other state organizations providing funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from the activities and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted on Saturday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". It is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and has blocked Greece from opening negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the acquisition of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed on a proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote was not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities were reported by 13 o'clock.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevsky, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, in Strumica on September 30, 2018 joined the referendum on changing the country's name, which would open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of the parliament in Skopje and moved the chairs in front of the tents that were set by those boycotting the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would represent a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
In order for a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government's policies since taking office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday and won 2:0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring a goal in the 65th minute.
An Argentine attacker received a midfield addition at the start of the attack.
He broke through three players of Brighton's defense and then landed on open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtook a few others at the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left according to Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguer, who threw the right-hand football into the right-hand side of the net and defeated Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero has some problems with his foot," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're happy he scored at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues an initial edge in the Premier League.
That score was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's field during that game.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling to the tripod.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City is fighting Hoffenheim in a group game of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to prevent Rocky's progress
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was not much reason to insist on a new start.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, get into playoffs.
The Rockies at least secured a place in the wild card playoffs on Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but they still hope to win their first title.
Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and another team would play at the highest level I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to release Sunday starters, but they are supposed to offer Scherzer to play in that case.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher room on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-hand man from Washington this season scored 18: 7, an average of 2.53 runs and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of Republican voters' turnout, the president spoke about his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge.
Everything we have done will be tested in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big — I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that happening right now.
Their intention is to take power again in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control; that's why they want power and control.
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "resist and interfere."
You've seen this over the last four days," he said, calling Democrats "angry, evil, corrupt, and liars."
He named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for a document — it was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer takes different views into account.
Does not tolerate personal attitudes
I was not too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour Party MPs who have been told they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our mind.
According to my agent, Joan Ryan behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironicly similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
On Friday, a notice on the meeting of the Labour Party of Nottingham East stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years I worked as a local member of the Labour Party were just like that on Friday evening.
Unfortunately, a lot of meetings are happening today in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the Party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the co-workers I felt shared similar political views with me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and take positions I would never otherwise agree with – whether it be national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a stream of insulting words on social media that call for my impeachment, that give up center politics, and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I received were mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal on mistrust or change of electoral rules we become an increasingly narrower party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and tell me that everything will be all right."
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, driven by the neglect of Margaret Thatcher's government, which left my school multi-purpose classroom to decay, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as a local councillor or minister in the government.
I never hid my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East branch could be misled about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at a time when the country is grabbing a Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political benefit will deter me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in Tennet's Premier League.
Now they have reached the top of the rankings and are the only ones undefeated by ten teams.
Finally, top defenses and better opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had a reason to be satisfied.
They have tried us every game so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose Club said, "Well done to Ayr, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt at Frazier Climo brought Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose an opportunity to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by eleven before, at halftime, he scored and made an independent attempt to change the score for Ayr to 17:5 ahead of the break.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was achieved by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridha Knott that they carried on the stretcher, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall, who had accomplished Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again forced the extra player to pay, and with the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to demolish the Clima that didn't have a ball; with a penalty line, MacPherson made a lay behind Ayr in full swing of penetration.
Climo made it happen, as he did almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry to the fifth home team attempt.
Still Game star appears ready for a new career in restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of Still Game, appears ready to continue working in service activities after being revealed to be the CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite screenplay and one of the stars, along with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last to be shown, and Kiernan seems to be planning to dedicate his life to after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "growing restaurant business in Glasgow".
The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it access to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the maritime centre full of cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the ocean color is reported on public buildings.
Maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazona have a slogan: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of Chile's lost coastline during the conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for re-sailing the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, following a five-year trial, these hopes may be at their highest level in decades.
Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course is optimistic about the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A multitude of Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens and hope that a court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia's position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is bound to negotiate the assignment of a sovereign way out to the sea to Bolivia.
Here Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from the ruling on Monday.
We are close to returning the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favour of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
A UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice verdict comes only six months after the final hearings means that the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, they may have been backward for the past four years.
The issue of access to the sea has been claimed by the current Bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has buried every good will of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will resume dialogue at some point, but after this, it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "break 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says it will not have nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during a meeting of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
The comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be inclined to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "lethal fantasies" and that the US's opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will by no means bring the North to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to endorse the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps for disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is a wide-ranging skepticism about Pyongyang's serious intention to give up the arsenal it probably sees as the only guarantee of its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large headgear is on the way to luxury trade in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely shelter the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a line of wacky huge headgear for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted style lovers at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats swept Instagram this summer, and these designers sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
The example that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide rim resembling feathers that completely "downloaded" the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cone with melted ice cream.
If you follow the big fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge caps could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
Huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of the "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference about 60 cm wide that has been seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks on the catwalk sent another great creation – a straw beach bag as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringe and white leather handle, was an exhibition copy in the summer collection Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous and famous stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for the next summer. Since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories."
John Edward: the language skills that the citizens of the world need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, and additional weight is given by individual and shared successes in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the aforementioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by independent school participants.
A total of 68% of foreign language learners received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent score for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest score possible.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Nowadays, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers cannot fill jobs due to a lack of workforce with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs are required to know the language, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives them an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov survey in 2013 involving more than 4000 adults, 75% of UK respondents do not know a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate in it, and French is the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15% of them in particular.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classical, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for languages that are considered to be most important in the UK in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, independent schools will always have a diverse selection, as well as teaching staff who are competent in this field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment where they will learn to prepare and arm themselves with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that, in today's global business, language knowledge is very important for the future of each country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will play Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
The fans will soon welcome the first LeBron James performance for the Lakers in Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes it will play.
More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel posted a tweet that James is unlikely to play the whole game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his preseason plans for the Lakers, which consists of six games.
At this stage of my career, I really don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose a majority in Congress after the November vote.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight, and how can you view it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19 hours east time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's approval decision has been pending for a week until the FBI investigation is over.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain an advantage for the November elections.
That's why Trump's presidential campaign headquarters say the five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
The majority in Congress is so important for the president's plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a tumultuous campaign," an anonymous spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the media from Pittsburgh," West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month on Saturday, winning more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who is lagging behind in polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in polls," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team left its heart on the ground before individual skirmishes on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a match between couples on Sunday afternoon may have been exactly what it took to reverse the Ryder Cup.
The Wheel of Fortune is a saying that is particularly valid in sports and in which athletes believe, especially in competitions like this.
To whom is the wheel of happiness now favored?
They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is on our side right now," said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europeans have a four-point advantage, while 12 points remain until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouragement from his game paired with Justin Thomas, with whom she scored three out of four points after a whole day of play.
Spieth played from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Cheerleader exclamation points became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, culminating in the key path by which Spieth reached the unresolved result.
After the way he won the game with 15 holes, a similar cheerleading howl followed in which one can recognize the hope and faith that the Americans can turn everything around.
You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
All these players have left now is that.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup sensation.
European weird, but irresistible couple has the maximum number of points and can't go wrong.
Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are the players to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the Europeans' victory as the sun sets over the Parisian Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it is still too early to talk about the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly arranged Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's doubles game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they failed to dig.
However, on Sunday there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It's fascinating to watch game pairs close up because you can see the interactions of players in a pair, hear the advice they give and those they don't give, as well as study a strategy that can change in a moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the team of the United States has the necessary combativity, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a 10:6 lead
Europeans after Saturday's doubles games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant US advantage of 10: 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two wins over Tiger Woods led with four points difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win a trophy that eluded her in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning doubles, achieving a score of 3:1.
The American team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already high.
To win the trophy, team Jim Furyk needs to score eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debutant to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", are only the second couple to score four points in a match in the Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, performed some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the doubles game with his partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a defeat of 2&1 by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But the Europeans didn't see everything as lubricated during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the bar high for their American team.
First, they defeated Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in fourballs, and then they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the entire history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was four points behind managed to return to individual games, although Fury's team only needs a draw to keep the trophy.
After two days in lag, Sunday's counterattack seems to be hard for them.
North Korea says it has no chance of unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said in front of the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions would increase distrust in the United States and that there was no way North Korea would unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will", for example stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled a nuclear test station and made a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
If we don't trust the United States, we don't have faith in our national security. Under such circumstances, there's no way we'll unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated North Korea's known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization approach that would phase out sanctions, his statement is significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the current U.S. president and leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim made a promise to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons before.
Washington also ignored calls to reduce strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists that denuclearization be carried out before that and pressure is increased by sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Ri added.
The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just a misconception of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the president of the United States spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister said Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held three meetings in the past five months and added: "If denuclearization had been sought by South Korea and not by the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a halt."
No matter what, the tone of Rio's speech differed greatly from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a "man rocket" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea this year at the United Nations, praised Kim for his bravery for disarmament, but added that much more work is ahead of them and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no time frame for denuclearization and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia have expressed their view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must strictly continue until full, final and verified denuclearization occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding the nuclear and ballistic missile program in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Rome at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him after a few hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex that will be realized if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" refer to the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in which they learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has enabled all students to get a good night's sleep in an attempt to combat an increasingly widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academician found that students at the world's best university often have no idea the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course that he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of a course after giving a speech about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did I find out this only now, at the last year of college?"
She said no one told her how important the dream was, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course explains how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
A professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of the University's health service, Paul Barreira, said the university decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students throughout the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes an image of a dormitory where students have to click cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important sleep routines are.
During the lecture, students learn that long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of campuses with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against weight gain because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it in a state of starvation and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to come up with a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1: 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the goal of Dolly Menge mow Steven Gerrard's deficient defense and ended the match with Livingston's 1:0 win.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first win after a triumph in February and a score of 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team now lags eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers seemed to have been left without inspiration and did not seem to equalize the score.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third place with only one goal difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when a case was dropped from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to his hips and so stumped next to Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston line-up that took the measure to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted that his well-designed line-up had suffocated any opponent's attempt.
The Rangers may have had more of the ball in their possession, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had the chance to score two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, which opened up space for Scott Pittman to head for Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed that opportunity.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward the imprecise blow to the rear rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope rather than with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that the judge should have sentenced him to 11 in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not take into account the Colombian request.
In the first half, the Rangers were able to point only two balls towards the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had one blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and the tame blow of Ovie Ejarija was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute playtime of Livingston slowed the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers missed Jacobs' return ball again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his composure and chose Menga to simply end the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had immediate effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long blow after another.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide leap out of the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton once again asked for an eleven because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away this time too.
Almanah: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now follows a page from our Almanach on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago...the day of the birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention a device known as the Geiger counter was later developed.
The mainstay of science since that time, Geiger's counter has also become the mainstay of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, in which the leading roles were played by seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What on earth is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves the withdrawal of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
The cells are treated to be able to "recognize" a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has receded for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting cells of the immune system from the patient, changing them in a laboratory to know how to "recognize" a protein called HER2 that is common to many types of cancer and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells from the immune system from the patient and their "learning" about how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West took part in the debates about Trump on Saturday Night Live and supported him, wearing a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again."
It didn't go well
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a break in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again," he continued to speak out against Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
I talk to white people so often and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it was not aired, a video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock tried to mock West.
Also, West complained to the audience that behind the stage he was accused of wearing a hat.
They were bothering me behind the stage.
They said to me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I was bullied!
They said I sank," according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see the bottom?" and said he would wear his Superman mantle because that means I can't tell him what to do.
Try with love."
Variety wrote that his comments caused at least twice the audience's displeasure, and Saturday Night Live's members appeared to be embarrassed, while one person told the magazine, "The whole studio was quiet."
West was called at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West, with the performance of the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, stunned many.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative group TPUSA, who said on Twitter: "To one of the people with the bravest spirit: Thank you for confronting the mafia."
But the show's host, Karen Hunter, said on Twitter that West was just "it was his own and it's absolutely wonderful".
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or by supporting his "art") who I believe accepts and expands the ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper posted on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now "officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change the name and follow Diddy's steps, which is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion, and of course, the deceased musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder with a knife at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder of a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Misdemeanor Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow wielding the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that due to such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The whale, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, admitted that he wanted to "very decisively" face this problem.
I personally feel very determined at this moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he asked.
What did we teach men when they were growing up, compared to the problem we are seeing now?
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could partly be responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught through TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they have to have certain traits of a man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong for the boys."
He also admitted in an interview that he would not record the sequels to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said he had "finished up with the battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will star in the new performance of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently discovered that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife by filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritta, the love of Jon Snow, in a fantastic series that won the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health workers say they have infected more than 820,000 people in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that the person infected with HIV is almost absent in this way.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Research estimates that due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV drugs in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has provided information about GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. MEP Maxine Walters denied Saturday that a member of her staff had released personal data from three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democratic Representative assures that these claims are being disseminated by "ultra-right wing" individuals, as well as websites.
Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of this information belongs to the office of Representative Waters, as well as information about the agent's staff member, The Hill newspaper reported.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is by no means responsible for the leak of this data.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs. Waters' statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
It shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who is accused of something he has not done should not be angry.
It must not be defiant.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Barbara Walters' reaction to criticism from Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during a hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the general elections against Waters, also said on Twitter.
That's important if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified these false claims to the "relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities".
We will make sure that the perpetrators are detected and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Johnny English: Back on the Job" review – Rowan Atkinson fights against spies
It is now common in every new British film to ask for messages about Brexit, and it seems that it is the same in the new screenplay of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, "Johnny English", was shown for the first time in 2003 and in 2011 returned to the big screens with the title "Johnny English rides again".
Will the twisted satire of our own about how much we are clearly worthless become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his sprawling eyes and a rubber face once again has the permission to complicate situations, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a wacky secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to be a "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr Bean's character, and somewhat resembles that guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and mysterious world man who was once played by Atkinson in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two cool moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller hit his helmet briefly.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie titles like "007" and "Mission Impossible" offer themselves elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be intended for children and not for adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's freaky events are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's mute gags embodied in Mr Bean's character.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a well-accepted fact.
The hacker entered Britain's most secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who is unfortunately played by Kevin Eldon in a brief appearance.
This spilled over a glass of prime minister's patience, a belligerent and belligerent character who is experiencing a complete breakdown of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson is trying to faithfully portray a character who should represent Theresa May, but she didn't really get the material to do something with.
Intelligence consultants reveal that all active spies are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And this person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the headmaster of a fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome gegs here because English teaches rock-style spying.
English is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he meets again with Bough, his former partner and his eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so the two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and funny events: disguised as waiters, they set on fire a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess by smuggling themselves onto Volta's luxury yacht, and English causes complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what the interior of Volta's house looks like.
Everything is done right for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and ostentatious the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it elaborates a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan according to which the British would work four days a week and be paid for their five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to bow to workers' interests.
The trade union congress supported the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
A four-day working week will not happen overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits the approach this party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this desire.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to elaborate on his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take the power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "profiters" in municipal businesses.
Shadow chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to return their entire stake as the Labour government could make "deductibles" based on observed irregularities.
He also endorsed plans to involve workers in corporate boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of the capital to private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak for "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency's conclusion can affect Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility the FBI would reveal something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made to you, and asked, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, unrelenting, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
I'm determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh, and it really should be a strong accusation to change that," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has firmly denied everything," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the persons appointed could confirm her claims.
36 years have passed since that.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh year in a row, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only star performances, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually, given that he has 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of so-called "clitism" – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters seeking to achieve a number of different goals.
He argues that these actions have been an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to an amount of more than $37 billion that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its activities, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership between investors and UK executives who are committed to "helping children develop to their full potential", with the promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from citizens of the world, they will provide $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in the area.
With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can make social injustice a footnote in history," Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the "The Power of Nutrition" project, which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on our website: "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responds: "It will be a long and difficult road" we will sometimes fail.
But we will succeed, as did the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports" Home Affairs Minister
Washington may, "if necessary," use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, according to the Washington Examiner weekly.
Zinke said that Russia's involvement in Syria "especially where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government" is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason why Russia is in the Middle East is that it wants to sell energy in this area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed those present at the event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States presents itself as the "voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, and he said Russia is "using the same trick" in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
Statements were made simultaneously with the Trump administration's intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2) pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, worth 11 billion dollars, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply fueled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts State Senator
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for herself.
It's time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that means a woman in charge," she said.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that "this country is headed in the wrong direction."
I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she posted on Friday, Warren said: "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Centre, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 per cent of votes for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats discussed in connection with the potential race for president in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and other wounds with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at Donald Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem about which he remained silent and told his son and other war veterans that "they return a little differently, they return hardened, they return wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the army, gave for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support a policy-challenging asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal politics has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Immigration Committee in 2014 to allow immigrants who do not have documents and are fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be dealt with on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle," the court friend's report said.
Lawyers further argued that a policy that denies entry to immigrants harms the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become an entrepreneur and "provide the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a policy statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more difficult.
The situation is very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palu.
Emergency vehicles bring in bodies every minute.
A government of scarcity of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, sweeping through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a back-and-shoulder fracture, rested outside the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continuous, severe earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "bullying" through "propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in the US daily that promoted the mutual benefit of U.S. and China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misappropriating the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid addition to the China Daily newspaper in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election was marked by what U.S. officials described in a Reuters statement as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American free speech and free press tradition by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
On the other hand, you will find limited voices of opposition on the newsstand in Beijing and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's disturbing economic trajectory because the media is under strong pressure from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers declined to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
Kavanaugh's debacle has left voters ahead of mid-term elections, analysts warn
As many Republicans stand alongside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very upbeat, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be returned," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell University, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last insistence on conducting an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: "November is coming!", protesting in the Senate hallway as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be beyond expectations," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be taller, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to the polls."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her claims of sexual assault by a Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that there may be a negative reaction if Republicans continue to confirm.
It's a real mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the reserve bench, but also about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided over who they will believe after Ford and Kavanaugh testify, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the authenticity of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations Ford has made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims she was shown her genitals at a party by a Supreme Court judge during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Launch New Internet to Download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
We have to do it now," he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, obligation lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access what information is fully user-friendly.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change in which all their business models would turn around completely overnight.
We are not asking for their permission.
In a statement published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the network's neutrality debate.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Consecration of the First World War Priests with the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was decorated with the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengles and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received the greatest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "unbelievably symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's venture for which he received this recognition.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the channel of St. Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "amazing courage" led the unit forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without anyone's help and mowing the three from the military squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's works were "something I know I could never achieve, and that excites humility."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid the wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be a part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that a lot of people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Piglet Peppa
Imagine this 'stay up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to make it impossible for you to follow the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other's match, viewers in the UK were shocked when the broadcast was interrupted by Piglet Peppa.
Many were not impressed at all after staying awake until the early hours of the morning just for the fight.
One fan of the cartoons on Twitter described it as a "some kind of sick joke".
According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Jupi, the Piglet Peppa.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include viewers from the UK in the future.
When I consider reruns, I think we can probably fix something," Coker said.
But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until Sunday, when they will be there on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, many correspondences circulated that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. The problem is of a state nature.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We'll keep five fights instead of six, which we usually do. We tried to give more to our fans, but we went too far.
It's unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he wasn't aware that "not everyone is like me."
In his statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that winning the Olympics has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others as "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity compared to other things have given me the power and strength to succeed.
He said he wanted to prove that he was "someone and something" so as not to disappoint anyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal has become a prominent figure in favour of LGBT people and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy to be able to live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he was surprised that he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem for him.
When you're so young you're going through so much," he referred to his first Olympic Games when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, "he said it was hard to find someone of the same age and that he experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the front row,'" he said.
I held his hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life" to jump in front of a domestic audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for the selection of the first song "Proud" by singer Heather Small "which echoed in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games and which always creeps.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to make a complete comeback to avoid an awkward turning point.
Mickelson, who played a record twelve times in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and working out his game on the training ground in the hope of correcting what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding Le Golf National pitch, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open's precise champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday, who won all four matches this week with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual matches with four points less, get to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man more than that and couldn't say.
He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence.
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I certainly didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more of them, but that's how it turned out and we thought we should do it that way.
He wants to be in the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain immaterial values to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for that," he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun with him this week too, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where Captain Seve Ballestro's team had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow difference of 141⁄2⁄2.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference," Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching the team in 2018 who won 5 ̶ 3 on Friday and led 10 ̶ 6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play with all your strength.
Go out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing is over until the floor on the board is advertised.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
All the time I speak, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are quite aware of who stands against us, the biggest players in the world."
Bjorn added: "In this I would never run before the ore.
Tomorrow it is necessary to face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're there as an individual, your golf player's abilities are on the final exam.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he has to give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of those major breakthroughs on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
I remember every damn word," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, a captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this momentum moves in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on mid-matches.
Accordingly, we organized our line-up and housed the guys as if, you know, we were going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
German new warship put on hold again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was due to be put into operation in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery hit the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period' should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships, which are said to allow Germany to go abroad, will become obsolete by the time it enters service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make a warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors ¶ half the size of the Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it turned out that the ship is dramatically too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) ̶ compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was actually " running out of ships capable of deployment."
The official said the problem had increased over time, as the old ships were decommissioned and there were no replacement vessels.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the navy.
National Foundation Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research conducted at the Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and wetland dwarf bats, as well as brown long-moved and river bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be set up in key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile inspections using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's vote and what kind it does.
Then a habitat map and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on the management of habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and works on landscaping that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and pet cat attacks.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on the trajectory of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species inhabiting Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal area for them.
Here in Threeve we have a huge space for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
However, there is still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other objects will help us better understand what they need to make progress."
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since the unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, possibly destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative for the Scottish bat protection association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their population is progressing."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
An attacker of Portugal and Juventus was charged with raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video posted on Instagram by his 142 million followers hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," says the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," he added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where she was allegedly raped by a footballer, according to documents filed at the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that "99 percent" was a "good guy" who was let down by that "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police and taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried that she would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing into Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve as part of a 100 million-euro crossing.
Brexit: UK will "regret forever" losing car manufacturers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses world leader status in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production delays at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates according to the "just in time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be a break at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at its Derbyshire plant would not be able to hold more supplies than needed for one day, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
We need to agree. We want to make the best possible deal that will not only enable us to maintain our current success, but also to seize this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 said in a statement.
The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain series.
In Toyota, they couldn't say how long production could be stopped, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Union of Unita, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, after these jobs have gone, they never come back again."
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney general, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been fueling the gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlap with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's lawsuits, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to aversion to the "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, although she said, "I will not object to the fact that they are blaspheming."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is organizing more meetings to answer questions than any president has done before," she said, adding no evidence: "We've analyzed the figures."
Brief remarks will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the president a direct question, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make this happen often, and you could see it in the last few weeks, and just so you can talk to the president of the United States, he will replace short press briefings."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers working in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to the EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express her gratitude and her wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already committed to meet the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers line player, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after suffering a head injury in Saturday's defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31 ̶ 27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
He got to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on a stretcher and sent it for further tests.
A representative at Tennessee State State University told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details on the type/ extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays the first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five shootings before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
According to the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people
This step will offset the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
An increase in taxes will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will contribute to the government's efforts to fight homelessness.
The "additional fee" added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago on other homes and properties purchased for the purpose of issuing it, can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects this move to raise £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are bought by residents who are not residents of the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for customers who buy the first property to get involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable real estate to fix the "shame about the housing situation" in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to the evictions caused by nothing.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream" that the life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British ones.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is one day to become the manager of Scotland.
The Scottish (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the northeast club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light after leading St. Mirren again at the Scottish Football Championship last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Cani.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn't feel fear because he inherits such well-known names in such a big club, having previously rejected calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success for me at the moment will be measured according to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Because of its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.
Ross only completed his third year of management, following a period during which he served as an assistant chief in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as a member of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and led St. Mirren from the edge of falling out to the champions of the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academico.
It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over Alloa.
I really believed that management is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I managed well, made a solid profit and enjoyed quite a successful moment.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and job pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I have ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for a pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenue for British pubs struggling with finance, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars generated an increase in revenue in July by 2.7 percent, but the revenue in restaurants was reduced by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the business consulting of the Office of the Chief Accountant of Business Books, who collected the data, said: "Continuing the good weather and England's participation in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month, when pub revenues rose by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now being even more affected.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where mostly drinks are served have made much greater gains under the same conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served are also affected by the heat, though not as dramatically as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 percent over the month, and food sales declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM for rest and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we see since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although the fall in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food managers, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-needed break."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the share of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales tracking system for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and an industrial benchmark has been established.
One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The research reveals that one in five children, some just 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20 000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "false Insta" sites
The news has heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account that showed their parents
One in five children, some just 11 years old, open secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey involving 20 000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" accounts by reference to a photo sharing site.
The news has heightened the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned "main" account for parents, and at the same time they have private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter's secret website found a teenager who encouraged others with the words "rape me".
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, half of which admit to owning private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athlete" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a board member," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 games in Atlanta, out of his total four Olympic golds, and is now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack he was no longer able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I was going to recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for the agility exercise!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
Opinions shared on the Internet about a traitor ad that compares mothers to cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed their children to cows who muse has aroused shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be "the world's first silent wearable traitor", Elvie for consumer technology has released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music whose text reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a udder, these are my breasts."
Then comes the chorus: "pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump, milk your ladies."
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it sheds light on the "horrific" of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except for stealing their children a few days after birth," one person wrote.

The second person comments: "Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "A completely crappy advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was "too funny".
I think this is a genius idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
The milk issue made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I understood it the way it is.
This is an ingenious product," she said.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at moms who issue milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like a 'cow'.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who betray milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, there are no wires or tubes, and he discreetly fits into the bra for breastfeeding women, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even come out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of the Mother agency, commented: "The traitor Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a courageous and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put the issue and all its challenges in the spotlight, and at the same time demonstrate in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This is not the first time that the traitor Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to tent camp on Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping forward and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not previously been recorded in criminal records.
Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, with the aim of faster proceedings for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear through a video conference call, not in person, in order to bring their case to the immigration court for obtaining legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling to be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "Occupation Forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "the battle in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with the support of Russia on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda, "who will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited to "revisioning the articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By this logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope for, the recall and scandal overturn his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be the "most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There are currently no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" show surpassed viewership with as many as 3.5 million viewers in the broadcast evenings of major news.
It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, a producer of ABC's "Designed Survivor" drama, about the secretary of government who becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Ms. Scovell.
There is a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
But you're exceeding the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts discussing how Bob Woodward used sources of "deep background" for his "Fear" book, about Paul Manafort's ostrich leather jacket worth $15 000 ("a garment full of arrogance," Washington Post writes) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, Mr. Trump's anatomy given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria again with the same eyes.
Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he feeds you with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show, about the rotating cast and the daily plots of the Trump show (fighting N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you'll be behind.
When I got to Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of Kauai Island it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and at the same time filming CNN.
He could not separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung on the end.
I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from the outside flows into the most uncertain mid-term election race for the Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reorganised district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh is highlighted by the Democrat Conor Lamba ̶ who won a seat in the second district last spring in a special election.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally tailored in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign financing battle between the main party fundraisers, the Committee that collects funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely monitored March special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
That position has been held for more than a decade by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political analysts gave a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The U.S. weighs whether to punish El Salvador for providing support to China, and then withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," Heather Nauert said in a statement.
However, the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to proceed to a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and therefore ended any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The following is a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, about which there is now considerable publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to step forward again, and perhaps ultimately with a jury of equals.
There are many of these "ifs" and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that he secretly proposed shooting the president last year and speculated about his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
How will we respond if the recently commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections to the Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall on these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I don't think we're going to fall for the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once resided in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that desk with a hooky cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about confronting Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the European League Group G.
The knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in a season to a 2⁄2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger things.
It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
We got into the game believing we could achieve something and we got a point.
Maybe we could have stolen the game in the end, but, generally speaking, the result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Hire health representatives to identify a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the tiny details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires immediate medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please provide details in writing to be ready.
It's not just about finances, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since the communications were interrupted, aid officers were unable to obtain any information from Donggale Province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-magnitude epicentre of the earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, the administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Sulawesi region's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the region of Pidie Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sara Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by a state police officer in Alaska.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in Mat-Su custody and is held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course," the network reported.
Palina is charged with three class A offenses, which means he could be in jail for up to a year and fined $250 000.
He was also charged with a class B violation, which is punishable by one day of imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possessing weapons in an alcoholic state that are related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulating that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfulla Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a home depot rental truck to attack a bicycle path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mow pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted a serious bodily injury, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury hit Saipov with a 22-point indictment that included eight charges of murder and extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in cases of organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov performed it as "heinous, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the South District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching a video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, not to accept guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of those events for everyone involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative member of parliament says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a conference of conservatives.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" on Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's members suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said the marches in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have come out if Mr Farage had been Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks is highlighted by the Tories who tend to stay on the sidelines of a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her compromise plan "Chequers" amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and the EU.
The Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been given the title and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
If he were in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of parliament in Wellington added: "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out Chequers."
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain completely inaccurate."
Conservative and Brexit supporters Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, speaking to reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and chose us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are willing to let down a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
Now it's a matter of trust between us people and our political class," he said.
They're trying to issue a Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'it's not going to pass you'."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has given us a victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-sufficient, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Many activists waved banners to "Tories Against Brexit" after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's app during the opening of the conference.
These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for the undisturbed situation at the borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat was talking about her future on Saturday at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been at the heart of speculation for some time now that it could oppose Trump in 2020.
The meeting Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that meant a woman in the lead."
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death of Louisiana State University basketball player (LSU) Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims (20) was killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
Wayde Sims got a bullet wound in the head and eventually died as a result," Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told the media on Saturday at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of the crime and owning weapons and killing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a 198 cm high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in 10 first lineups last season and an average of 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Cup title after the order secures him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team order would "play a major role in the race".
From his initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton on the back, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action on the wheel, which made Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the interior at risk of lagging behind after a double move in the defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then ran a large part of the race as he trusted his tyres to achieve a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally got into boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was tough because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me through.
The team has done a truly remarkable job of achieving a formational finish," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she had not released a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and dishonest," he said.
When you look at the disclosures and leaks of information to the public, and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer...have you released a document to the public – ‘aa, what?
Oh, no.
No.
Wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein was sent a letter in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't let her story go public," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.
However, her denial was not met with the approval of the president, who commented at a meeting on Saturday evening: "Let me tell you something - it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defence as a candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see evil, disgust, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 ̶ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for defeating Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5'3.
In the early minutes, the Giants took advantage of the two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led home to equalization, and then Dwyer put the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equated for Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third defeat in the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 ̶ 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35, with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead with the Beauviller hit four minutes later.
In the hurried opening of the game, Sullivan brought home the home team in 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt made it possible for Connie to be tied at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with the lead when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The natives regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalize in measuring forces naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of winning when his team was already halfway through to winning the last third of the game.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, hosted the Milton Keynes team on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake that struck Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Control Tower, which was rocking hard.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of the Batik Air on Flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
Our heart breaks because of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says limited access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutongo.
It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, as many bodies are still under rubble, and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached a height of up to six meters destroyed Pale, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency vehicles bring bodies every minute.
The government lacks clean water.
Small shops are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pale on Sunday and said to the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not trace one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had failed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waists to the exit in the event of a plane crashing.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby to repair the docks also helped rescue using a boat to inflatable people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
The Air Safety Network data indicate that there have been 111 deaths in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but none of them involved Air Niugins.
The analyst presents a timeline of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution closed the case in a retrial of a man accused of exterminating a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone data to stack a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old indictee Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at a time when, according to his own claims, he was with a friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "lied, because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone data showed that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
Defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed singing group in Bristol claims that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York City babysitter sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "another black woman".
The couple denies being racist, comparing the charge to "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out on her first working day in 2016 that she was the new nanny of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
Neee is another black woman," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "inconvenient" situation, and fired Mrs. Maurice for what she claimed was that their former nanny, who was African-American at the time, was doing her job badly, and that she was expecting the Philippines instead.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work and then went home.
Now Maurice sues the couple for a cancellation fee and seeks compensation of $350 per day for the period of six months for which she was originally engaged, albeit without a contract.
I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist, saying that ending Maurica's employment was reasonable, due to fears that she would not be able to be trusted later on due to insults.
My wife didn't mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave after the birth of her child and was in a "very difficult situation".
You will sue someone who is in such a situation.
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers will not identify with the talking teddy bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before publishing it.
It's very fun what we now know about Paddington's tremendous success."
Saying her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write a children's book, would be optimistic if his work were rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't a boaster," she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was perceived as some achievement by your own child: you are proud of him, even though none of that is really your work.
I think Paddington's success was seen in that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington alone."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Over he regularly called to say that it was really bad and that they believed he would not get away with it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart functioning slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding and then everything went out.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside me."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were not aware of the temptations she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I put my head down, and the tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a great sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicide
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with an infectious smile waiting for a dazzling career.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a "real dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried that this will have a negative effect."
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards "so that people know that there is someone you can go and talk to, even if he's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom when the children opened the presents, he didn't look them in the eye or want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but that they had to overcome it: "All this leaves a large cavity in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we will continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation
I thought we might be able to bring a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for, a time-limited investigation," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the board was "disintegrating" in the midst of a rooted party blockade.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is driven by the choice of moment.
The mid-term elections come in just five weeks, November 6, if, as is expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be severely weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break down with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is falling under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors from North to South Korea dropped after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
Referring to data from the United Southern Federation Ministry, Byeong-seug Park said there were 1127 defectors last year compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and higher charges that people smugglers charge.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors eventually obtained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearisation talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to liberate the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korea's foreign minister, blamed US sanctions for failing to make any progress since.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not come to mind that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" candidate and said he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and suffocating while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated denigration" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not take part in the Supreme Court's work, because he showed that he had prejudices against Democrats.
I think he disqualifys himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
When asked if he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi relinquished.
I'll say the following if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only capable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade's abortion law, because she was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful'," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justifiable criticism, the anger that has been gathering for months and years can't get rid of all this without crying.
We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be the executive director and who said she was crying too when she got angry, but she developed a technique to, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to says the following: 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was that, once I cried out for inexpressible anger, an elderly woman, a cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, dragged me to the stairs.
Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be glad because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason to consider running for president.
It wasn't a well-designed decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already advanced, she lagged behind in fundraising, and vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who gave her $1000 each to men, gave her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she was saying she wasn't going to launch a formal campaign, she was so engrossed by the emotions of the people who supported her, by the frustration of a system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and by the anger of sexism, that her throat was squeezed.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Mrs. Schroeder of the media's reaction to it.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what he was going to put on my gravestone.
She cried.
How a trade war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The start of the trade war between the US and China has resonated loudly and, while the battle is far from over, the rift between countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way, and a five to ten percent tariff has recently been imposed on US$60 billion in goods.
China has promised to hit the United States with a blow, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington's withdrawal could be achieved by easing demands, but public compliance with the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger economic stabbing in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "ready" to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave for terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods have been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would benefit from the help of rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a final result of 16.5 ̶ 10.5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again, while the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, sent the ball to the 16th hole of the pair 3 in the water at the first blow, leaving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all rounds and has become one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was kicked out of Denmark by Thorbjorn Olesen, the European team's lowest-ranking player, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
I usually don't cry, but today I can't stop the tears.
The year was tough.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
It's all up to the team. I'm happy I could help," said Garcia, full of emotion after the European victory.
He transmits the torch to his compatriot John Rama, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods on Sunday, score 2&1.
I feel incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The US team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At certain times we resisted Europe.
We failed.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA America and our Committee of Ryder Cups, so we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take off the hat for people.
We're overplayed."
New data on red tide: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Commission for the Conservation of Fish and the Plant and Animal World of Florida (FWC) shows a general decrease in the concentration of red tide in parts of Tampa Bay Bay Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions of heterogeneous algae blooms are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier ̶ which indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinelas County to the southern part of Lee County.
The flowering areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
In the past week, there have been medium concentrations in Pinelas County or in the associated offshore area, low to high concentrations in the offshore area of Hillsborough County, common to high concentrations in Manatee County, common to high concentrations in Sarasota County or the associated offshore area, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in Lee County or the associated offshore area, and low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation cases continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
