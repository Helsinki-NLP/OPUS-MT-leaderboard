Welsh MPs are concerned that they will “look like Muppeti”
Some Assembly Member (AM) astonished the proposal that could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentary representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they might become the subject of the deceit.
An MP from the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that this name was “rhyed with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid, and pwp govance.
Parliamentary representative from the Wales Party (Welsh Plaid Cymru) stated that the group as a whole was “not satisfied” and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh Conservative stated that his group was “open” to change the name, but that the MWP in speech could quickly be converted to the Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing the law for the introduction of the name change, said: “Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary representatives will title themselves.”
The 2017 Wales Government Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June the Committee published the results of a public consultation on proposals that came across broad support for changing the name of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to how it will be called MPs in the parliament, the Committee was inclined to be called “members of the Welsh Parliament” or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
Members of Parliament propose alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be brought by a headache to the Speakers of Parliament Elin Jones, who are expected to submit a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way parliament functions, including rules on the disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary representatives will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go out to a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether they want to change the name of their country to “the Republic of North Macedonia”.
The purpose of voting is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece in which there is a province called Macedonia
Athens persisted for a long time in claiming that the name of its northern neighbor constituted the acquisition of the Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the initiation of the process of its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not acknowledge the referendum decision.
However, subscribers to the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is simply a price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells silent as the churches in Harlem fight for survival
The older people I talked to said that in the past, one could find a bar and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is no one else.”
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
People are hanging out in another way today,” he said.
Bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighbourhood where people stay regularly.”
When it comes to churches, it is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and “before or later will be found again at the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people who would not help the remaining churches in the neighbourhood would live.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and therefore the day when these churches will be completely closed will come faster because the residents who move into these apartments are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white methodistic congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
The Black Congregation that maintained the nearby liturgy took ownership of the building.
Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation with Reverend John Howard Johnson led by a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed employment or improvement of blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of father Johnson and successor in St. Martin, proudly called carillon the “bells of the poor”.
A carillon expert in July used a different name: “cultural treasure” and “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by the black musician Dionisio A. Lind who has been playing on a larger carillon in Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin did not replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the lay leaders of the church and other episcopal dioceses.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July for the concern that the diocese would “to shift costs” to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of the construction works sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-year-olds While Snorkeling for Lobsters in California
According to an official statement, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for a lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the station KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had snorkeled with his friends about an hour and a half a Saturday when he heard the boy's call to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought it was about the excitement of the caught lobster, but then he realized that he shouted “I was bitten!
He bit me!”
Hammel said that when he approached the boy he noticed that his entire key bone was torn.
I was terrified that everyone came out of the water: ‘It’s a shark in the water!’, said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain of the rescue team Larry Giles said at the press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct investigations and bathers’ safety at 48 h.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s beauty market entry plans in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes a competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing beauty counters in the style of department stores and engaging specialized sellers.
As part of the UK’s major entry into the UK’s beauty market, worth £2.8bn, which continues to grow parallel to the decline in sales on the clothing and home equipment market, larger beauty desks will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways supermarkets strive to use space on shelves that was once designed for TVs, microwaves and home equipment.
Representatives of Sainsbury’s stated that they would double the size of the cosmetic product offering to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for specific brands similar to stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its assortment of decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and that is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume trader will test concessions in two Sainsbury‘s stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Buying online and returning to everyday shopping for small quantities of food in local grocery stores means supermarkets have to try harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s said outlets would look more like a department store while this supermarket chain is trying to resist affordable stores such as Aldi and Lidl offering more services and non-food products.
In hundreds of stores, Sainsbury’s introduced Argos outlets, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because two years ago he bought both chains, which made the sale of food items more profitable and profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its departments of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products was not successful.
At the beginning of 2000, Sainsbury ‘s entered into a joint venture with Boots, but this ended with a quarrel over the sharing of pharmacy income in his supermarkets.
The new strategy followed after Sainsbury‘s sold his pharmaceutical business for €125 million three years ago at the 281 Celesiu store, owned by Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds claims to play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skincare products including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks Commercial Director Sainsbury’s said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide our customers with a more comfortable environment.
We also invested in special training colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands are designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination to buy cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones "rageous" after Holly Willoughby gave up a £11 million contract
Dragon’s Den Peter Jones’s star was left to “cooking out of anger” after Holly Willoughby’s TV host gave up a £11 million deal with his brand to focus on his new contracts with the Marks & Spencer store chain and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their brand of home clothes and accessories Truly.
Their brand is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of This Morning (37) announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon‘s Den Peter Jones star to cook from anger by withdrawing from a joint profitable business at the last moment to focus on his new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources argue that Jones was “rageous” when a golden girl on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million mean that there is no longer enough time to devote to their home clothing brand and Truly accessories.
This business was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and was supposed to double Willoughby’s wealth estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said, “Truly was one of the greatest Holly priorities.
This should have been a long-term investment in the future that would have provided it for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw was astonished by everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At Marlow’s headquarters, there is a lot of goods that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that because of the departure of the show leader This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and possible additional delay in starting the line.
And that could also mean the end of many years of friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend holidays together and Jones has a share of 40% in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as ITV show host I‘m a celebrity.
A source close to Jones last night said, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Hard negotiations and then we fell in love
He joked at the expense of the criticisms he would receive in the newspaper because of comments that some might find “unworthy presidents” and because he has such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give so many giveaways?”
said Trump, mimicking the news leader's voice.
I have not given any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea in June.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, the main diplomat of North Korea Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the north did not notice an “adequate reaction” of the US to North Korea’s disarming activities.
He noticed that instead the US still did not revoke sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the meeting.
He said, “We’re going great with North Korea.”
“We were threatened by war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – breaking trial launches of missiles, helping free the hostages, and returning the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to act as a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing at a crowd of people directly in front of us.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake on Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to be necessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not seeking international help, so all this is a bit problematic,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children organization is drawing up a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Office, stated that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Paul to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in efforts to provide assistance.
Given the constant shaking of soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although the shelters in the case of cunami were built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coast line.
The absence of a mermaid for cunama warning in Palu, although the warning was in force, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time the journey between the many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A ship of hospitals anchored in Lombok for the care of earthquake victims is on its way to Pal, but it takes at least three days to reach a new disaster spot.
Improving the Indonesian decayed structure was the basis of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But state administration under Joko fights with a lack of funds, and next year new elections are held.
Joco also faces the pressure of remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people were killed, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets of machetes, bows, and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the equal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool on Saturday from defeat in the Premier League match against Chelsea at a hit in the 89th minute on Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while being at about 30 meters from the Chelsea goal at a score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He switched the ball to his left leg before kicking it towards the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaj Arrizabalagaj who jumped towards her and entered the net.
It was demanding to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players such as Shaq always try to get as close as possible to the naked, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” said Sturridge for LiverpoolFC.com
I saw that Buckets were coming and I was just one touch ball, I didn’t think too much about it and just shot it.”
In half, Chelsea ran from 1:0 after the hit of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in 25th minute.
The blue attacker forwarded the ball back to Mate Kovačić during that match before turning somewhere in half of the field and running to Liverpool’s half.
Kovačić made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
He then sent a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard bypassed the defense and hit the ball in the net on the opposite tripod next to the goalkeeper Liverpool Alisson Becker.
Liverpool played a match of the club competition against Napoli in the Champions League at 15 pm on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton in the UEFA European League at 15 h on Thursday in London.
The number of fatalities in Indonesian cunamis grew to 832
The number of fatalities in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia grew to 832, the state office for disasters said on Sunday early in the morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho spokesperson said at a press conference that a large number of people were reported trapped in the ruins of buildings after the earthquake 7.5, which was felt on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters in height.
The city of Pal, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is full of remains of demolished buildings.
The police arrested the man (32) for suspicion of murder after the woman was killed.
The assassination investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, morning.
A 44-year-old found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old was arrested for suspected murder.
The police invited the people in the area to contact if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still at the beginning, but I would like everyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead to turn to us, and they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
The police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found was the resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came on the scene who think they knew that woman in order to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said that the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim is ongoing.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter the building or get out of it.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Tenants have now been told that it will take a few hours until they can return to their apartments.
The policeman reportedly told someone that the whole area is now considered a crime site.
A woman appeared at the scene of crime in tears.
He constantly repeats, “It’s so terrible.”
At 14:00 in the fenced area there were two police vans, and another one was parked just outside.
A large number of officers stood inside the fenced area and supervised the residential block.
Anyone who has any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, called 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, referring to the record 247 of September 30th.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament is the latest monument that was found in the middle of a discussion about “exception of history”
His persecution would be poetic justice for the almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's society called Mr. Crick's attempt "a nonsense" and "a attempt to overthrow history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell's society, said: "The debate currently underpinning the removal of statues was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Westminster Palace became the subject of discussion.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars is not something Cromwell ordered or implemented.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The wonderful revival of Cromwell's cheese by William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of the way of thinking of the 19th century and part of the history of a person that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, and of course, in his case it was the pressure of monarchy.
Is it a fully credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual distinctive figure that represents one side of that division.
His accomplishments in the role of Lord of the Patrons continue to be worthy of honor and celebration.”
Pig killer killed by Chinese farmer
According to reports of local media, the pig attacked and killed the farmer at the market in southwestern China.
A man named only the surname “Yuan” found dead-cut arteries and covered with blood near a barn in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, published the Jutarnji list of southern China on Sunday.
The pig breeder was about to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, China’s Qinghai province.
He allegedly arrived on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and the doors of the adjacent pigsty were opened.
He said that in the stall there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that the pig was bitten 250 kilos by the breeder until his death.
Guiyang's evening news state that a relative who is called "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were bloody and crippled."
A snapshot from the security camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan did not belong to him or his relative.
The Market Manager stated for the Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent someone else from attacking while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market administration allegedly negotiate a compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, pig attacks on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kg pig had landed a Welsh farmer next to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After eating farmers in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
They are just playful.
They nibble, they are very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
Residues of hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the south-west of the USA
As announced, hurricane Rosa weakens as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodplain rains in the North Mexico and Southwest of the United States during the following days.
At 05:00 p.m., it was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a hurricane of category 1, and located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is created above the Pacific and moved towards the US West Coast.When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will start to suppress the deep layer of tropical moisture in the direction of the North to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause the formation of heavy precipitation in a large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, mud flashes and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation to occur approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
torrential flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not advisable to go to the desert on foot due to the dangers of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into wild rivers, and rain showers with thunder will bring local storms and dusty winds.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to parts of Southern California’s coast.
Precipitation is possible in an amount greater than 12 mm, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
It will be the first precipitation in the wet season in this region.
The scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday late in the evening and Monday early in the morning before the end of the day on Monday and cover the wider area on Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touching and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes throughout the US are possible as the Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central US.
The difference in temperature between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
It is expected that in most of the central and eastern US, the beginning of October will be warm with 27 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be approximately 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates the high chance of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks the intense testimony of candidates for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 80s.
In the meantime, a political statement continued, and Rapporteurs interrupted the regular programme to notify the change at the last moment of that Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, Arizona’s senator, that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate court committee that he was completely sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to take off her clothes at high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a fervent testimony that he was completely sure that it did not happen.
On Friday, more than 20,4 million people were likely to follow the hearing, the number stated in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers for other networks that transmitted the hearing was not immediately available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To illustrate this better, it is a audience that is similar in number to the one that looks at playing American football or awarding Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose studio guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during a full-day hearing, they reported from Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Occupation remained large even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS on Friday morning filmed as protesters shouted on it as he tried to take the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
A few minutes there was a glance down while the demonstrators showered him with splinters live in front of CNN’s cameras.
I stand here in front of you,” said a woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to this country?”
They told him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the hearing of the board.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Board was supposed to vote on the referral of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote across the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only on condition that the FBI investigates the accusations against the candidates during the next week, which was demanded by Democrats who are in the minority.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of “playing policies” with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of “playing policies” with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in another interview with her on the front page, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other customs duties “complete nonsense”.
Killing Wayde Sims: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson Suspected of the LSU Player's Death
Police arrested Suspected of Killing Wayde Sims Firearms, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and held in custody under charges of negligent murder, police administration Baton Rouge said.
Officials released a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost the glasses in the conflict.
Police found the goggles at the crime site and reported that they found Simpson's DNA on them, reported WAFB, a branch of CBS.
After testing Simpson, the police said he admitted he had shot Wayde and killed him.
A security of 350,000 US dollars is requested.
On Friday, East Baton Rouge's mortuary office published a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was the proliferation of the head through the neck.
The Police Department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Refugee Working Group, the Federal Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation leading to arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “persistence and search for the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 183-cm-high wing player grew up in Baton Rouge where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was “de desperate” and “shocked” because of Wayde’s death.
That’s what we always care about,” Wade said.
Volcano Shoots Ash at Mexico City
The ashes that ejected the Popocataptel volcano reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach volcano after increased crater activity and registered 183 gas and ash emissions for 24 hours.
The center was accompanied by multiple rumbles and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists notice an increased activity of volcanoes located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since the 2017 earthquake of magnitude 7.1 has shook central Mexico.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Conflict between police and Catalan separatists to meet the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence advocated by the intervention police and after thousands of people joined the counter-demonstrations to mark the Catalan polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began to shoot police with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded with tourists.
The fights broke out later during the day when the police used the batons to calm the fight.
During a few hours, the groups who advocate independence have been scandalized by “There is no oblivion, there is no forgiveness”, and the unionists have shouted “Long lived Spain”.
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital for minor injuries during demonstrations, the local press said.
Tensions in a region that aspires to independence did not diminish even a year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal, and which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters opted for independence even though the exit was small because those who boycotted the voting against secessions.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured in fierce conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting venues across the region.
Independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations took place, but the demonstrators were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes (68), an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations together with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we experienced one of the best moments.
I looked at my parents crying with happiness that they could vote, but now we got stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved a key, albeit a tight victory in the regional elections of last December, the Catalan independence parties have hardly managed to maintain momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-imposed exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict triggered by politicians on both sides.
The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who announced to the Investigative Prison from the end of last year that he would run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
Nomination for the European elections is the best way to make known the regression of democratic values and the repression we experienced from the Spanish government,” he said.

Hit Menge brought Livingston a victory over Rangers with a score of 1:0
First goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston has won
The new Scottish Premiership League club Livingston surprised Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat of eighteen matches at the head of the club from the Ibrox Stadium.
The goal of Dolly Menge proved decisive as Gary Holt's team aligned with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a win at the Premiership this season, and next Saturday they are playing against Hearts, the leading club in the league for which eight points are behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday as part of the European League.
Livingston has in the meantime increased his series of victories on six games, and head coach Holt still hasn’t experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored the goal, given that their directness in the attack caused a number of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but was too slow on the way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only go a wide ball after slipping to intercept Craig Halkett's head against the goal.
Hosts gladly let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties to guests
And that is exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting the Mengi who hit in the middle of the goal.
By that time, Rangers mostly had control over the ball, but faced the impenetrable domestic defenses, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly had no work.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
Rangers Allan McGregor's legs stopped Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent a wide blow from another organized attack of Livingston.
The long additions failed to cross Livingston's bare line, and two were not awarded for the eleven – after Halkett's conflict with the replacement player Glen Middleton and one for playing with his hand.
“Great” from Livingston – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent game and result of Livingston.
All to one were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on that entry path.
Their style of play and staff hardly changed since their return to the big clubs, but the big credit goes to Holta and the way he united the team from his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a brilliant head of a well-organized defense, and Menga throughout the game did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a break.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set a good game under Gerrard.
They didn’t manage to dress up the ball to the end, and only once they opened a hole in the home team and it is a kind of call to tear up for the Rangers that are in the middle of the scale.
Erdogan welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), there were a lot of smiles under the open sky when the leader of Tursa and Germany met with breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany – whose goal is to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have diverged opinions on issues involving human rights, freedom of press and accession to the EU of Turkey.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open up a huge new mosque.
This city is home to the largest population of the Turks outside Turkey.
For safety reasons, the police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
Hundreds of protesters of Erdogan – of which a large number of Kurds – raised their vote by condemning Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him with a welcome in the country.
Conflict demonstrations reflect the divide caused by a visitor by some German Turks celebrating as a hero, and others attack as an autocratic.
Deptford road crash: a cyclist fatally crashed in a collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the crossroads of Bestwood and Evelyn Street, on the road with dense traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred a few months after the death of another cyclist after the crash and the driver’s escape from the accident in Chiders Street, about a kilometer and a half from the Saturday accident site.
They reported from the city police that police officers sought to identify a man and inform his closest relatives.
Because of the accident, roads are closed and the bus traffic is diverted, and motor vehicle drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Unrest
They reported that six police officers were injured in riots in men's jail type.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special “Tornado” units were brought to combat unrest involving eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the spot were given assistance due to minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesperson said: “Specially trained prison staff were hired to deal with the ongoing incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members received assistance due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that everyone will be given responsibility to the police and be able to spend a long time behind the bars.”
In Long Lartin prison, there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after being attacked by the prisoner.
And in October last year, the intervention police were called into prison to resolve the serious situation in which the staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (possible benefit for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hits Arizona, but there is a chance that this will happen at the beginning of the next week when the hurricane Rosa passes over the desert southwest with the rest of the power and brings a risk of torrential floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings of torrential flooding for Monday and Tuesdays in the area from Western Arizona, across South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should approach Phoenix late on Monday with rain and cross straight over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service in Phoenix reported in its tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones brought a tropical storm or depression within a radius of 320 kilometers from Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.”
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities of up to 150 mm at the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert southwest including the Rockies and the Great Pool there is a chance of precipitation of 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total quantities of up to 100 mm.
For those beyond the risk of torrential flooding, Rosa could come as a salvation because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a major danger, some of these precipitations may be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. wetlands map, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” said weather.com.
Hurricane paths first approached the coast along the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of hurricanes with a maximum wind speed of 130 km per hour and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moved north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm encountered colder waters of the Pacific and thus weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening the coast of Mexico will come closer by the force of a tropical storm.
Rain on parts of Mexico could be strong and pose a significant risk of flooding.
The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California Peninsula to the north-western Sonora is from 75 to 150 mm, the maximum of 250 mm possible,” said weather.com.
Rosa will then head north over Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving to the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and into South Utah until Tuesday late in the evening.
The main danger expected of Rose or its remains is very heavy rain on the Baja California Peninsula, in the north-west of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest,” they said from the National Hurricane Center.
Rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and mud floods in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
Around 04.00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found injured teenager.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a stable state.
Avon and Somerset Police Department said that a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have invited everyone who has a record of the event to contact.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffered malice and anger of Democratic Party
A voice for judge Kavanaugha is a voice to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a pre-election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh “would suffer malice and anger” of the Democratic side during the nomination process.
Kavanauh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's accusations for a sexual assault ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Christine Ford also testified at the hearing of the accusation he had made.
The President said on Saturday that day that the American people saw the brilliance, quality, and courage of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to confirm the judge Kavanaugha is the voice to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, the judge with a flawless career in public service,” he told the supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nominations as he spoke about the importance of the Republicans' exit to elections in the half of the presidential term.
Five weeks divide us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I actually do,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump stated that the democratic mission is to "create resistance and obstruction".
The Assistant Leader of the Republicans said for CNN that the first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh nomination is expected at the latest on Friday.
Hundreds of fatalities in Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, and the number continues to rise
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people were mortally destroyed, of which a large number of them were dragged by huge waves hitting the coast when a large earthquake and a cunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pal on Friday when the twilight waves of up to six meters high hit the coast, dragging many of them to death and destroying everything on their way.
The Cunami followed the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday there was a danger of cunami, people were still on the beach and didn’t run away immediately,” said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB at a press conference in Jakarta.
“Cunami did not come alone, he dragged cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the Cunami crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape from the tsunamis and survive,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
aerial photos published by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy released by the giant earthquake on Friday corresponded to the double power of the atomic bomb cast at Hiroshima World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city at the end of a long and narrow bay may have increased the power of cunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of buildings and added that 540 people were injured, and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damages may be 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications are completely interrupted and we have no information from Donggal.
More than 300,000 people live in this area,” the Red Cross said, adding staff and volunteers to affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but the situation could deteriorate greatly,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a plethora of criticisms for failing to provide information that the cunami hit Pal, although officials claim that the waves came at the moment when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video that is shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of the building panickingly warns people down the street about the upcoming cunami.
Within a few minutes the water wall came to the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters agency could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused the disruption of communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
In the words of the competent army, it began to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still necessary food and other necessary necessities.
The city airport is only reopened for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit emergency centers in Palú on Saturday.
Cunami in Indonesia took more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donggale successfully arrived in the city of Pal, where employees were sheltered in the talented tents in their office yard, they passed on scenes of destruction on the way,” Mr. Doze said.
They told me they had seen a number of ruined houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups launched disaster relief wheels, some complained that foreign humanitarians with great expertise were prevented from coming to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the provision and engagement of staff from other countries can only begin if the scene of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened yet.
It is still a state-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says ‘OK, it is a national disaster’ we can receive international assistance, but such a situation has not yet been declared.’
When the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis fell on Pal on Friday, friends and families of those still missing hoped that their loved ones would be one of those wonders that mitigate black scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was saved from sewers.
On Saturday, rescuers freed a woman who was captured under the ruins next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, a trainer of the Indonesian state paragliding team trained two missing paragliders for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagija, were his students.
Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitions from Palu who participated at the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray check mark instead of two blue checkmarks.
I think this means that the messages are not delivered,” he said.
Thiefs claimed US$26,750 while charging ATMs at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 US dollars from Brinkov's employee who filled the ATM in the Newport on the Levee center, a press release for the Newport police administration.
In a press release by Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to recharge it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man “in the race came to Brink’s employee behind his back” and stole a bag of money that had to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses have noticed more suspicious people fleeing the location of theft, but the police did not indicate the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renamed to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change its name to Ye.
On Saturday’s Twitter post, where he announced the change, he wrote: “A living being officially known as Kanye West.”
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a while and has used it as the title of its eighth album released in June.
The change comes on the eve of his Saturday Night Live guest show, in which he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
The show's authors said he replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who cancelled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an acronym for his current artistic name, West previously stated that the word had religious significance for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year in an interview about the title of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So, I am you, I am me, it is us.
It started from Kanya, which means 'the only one', in only Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, everything within us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.”
He is one in a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And former West collaborator, JAY-Z, played with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen, and written in capital letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use an army against citizens
The candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation over the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
The troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on that square on October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people at the time when leftist student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to supporting the young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening a number of free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
Since China is becoming increasingly active in AI, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in research in that area,” said AI investor and expert in the Kai Fu Lee area who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
This was followed by the announcement of artificial intelligence plans by various parts of the US government, although the US generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: by 2030, its goal is to become the first country by the number of AI innovations.
The double increase in the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the US and that we are looking for the next major discovery in the artificial intelligence field,” Lee said.
A double increase in investment could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence coming to the US,” Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book is: “AI of Power: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” this month published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that won the best American game Othello, and was later director of the Microsoft Research Department and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee praised the previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. to encourage its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
I believe that doctoral candidates in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically offer green cards,” he said.
The Chinese Council of State published the Plan for the Development of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions similarly to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, whose purpose is to involve partners from the industry and academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment worth $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that wanted to set up the National AI Security Commission has been taking nothing for months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on changing their country's name
On Saturday, Macedonia’s citizens voted on whether they wanted to change their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that could resolve the dispute with Greece that has been going on for several decades and for which Greece blocked the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claiming that the name of its northern neighbor represents the affiliation of its territory and has invested veto on the entry of that country into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and the campaign to boycott the vote cast doubted whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you to join NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a price worth paying in order to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to access bodies such as the EU and NATO.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means safer lives for all of us,” said Oliver Georgievskaya (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said that they would respect it to be considered decisive.
Changing the name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, the output was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of voters voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined the referendum on the change of the name of the country in Strumica, which would pave the way for joining the NATO alliance and the European Union.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov in front of the parliament in Skopje set a small stage and approached the chairs in front of the tent set by those who boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not as servants,” said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment rates exceed 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will support the referendum, as more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said that a ‘positive’ result would represent a ‘confirmation of our future’.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will approach the referendum, which is below the required response.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, the exit must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policies of the Western government since taking office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to score a shot
On Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence and won Manchester City 2:0.
Aguero made the victory insanely simple, scoring a hit in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received the addition in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton defenders and then landed on the open ground.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green T-shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtaked several more on the edge of Brighton’s space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker returned the ball to Aguera from the first attempt, who put the right football into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero has some difficulties with the foot,” the journalist reported to Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola.
We planned to play a game of which 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We are happy to have hit at that moment.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues an initial advantage in the clash of the Premier League.
This hit was achieved in the 29th minute.
During this game, Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton’s court.
He wonderfully added the ball to Leroy Sane along the left side.
Sane pushed the ball several times before pointing Sterling towards the tripod.
The Sky Blues attacker inserted the ball into the net just before slipping into the car.
Manchester City is fighting Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Necker-Arena stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable the advancement of Rockies
Since Nationals players were eliminated from playoffs, there were not too many reasons to insist on a new start.
However, the competitively-moved Scherzer hopes for a Sunday win against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get into playoffs.
Rockies won 5:2 for the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to win their first title.
Although we are playing for nothing, we can at least throw knowing what kind of atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and another team would play at the highest level that I would witness this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
Nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but allegedly in this case they are inclined to offer Schezer to play.
The scherzer, who will make its 34th start, was heated in the space for launchers on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when it usually rests.
The righthand from Washington achieved a score of 18 : 7 in this season, an average of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds.
Trump at a conference in West Virginia
During the speech on the importance of the exit of Republican voters to general elections, the President conclusively commented on his choice of Bretta Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court judge.
Everything we have done will be tested in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m in a race and that’s why I’m everywhere, to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continues: “You see this terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to recapture power in any way; you see wickedness, corruption.
They don’t care about whom they have to hurt, whom they have to run over to take power and control; that’s why they want authority and control, and we won’t give them.”
Democrats, as he says, have a mission to "resist and interfere".
You have seen this over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “hot, evil, corrupt, and false.”
He served as Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Justice Committee, which caused a loud disapproval of the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released a document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I’m waiting for the document – it was really bad body language, the worst body language I’ve seen.”
The Labour Party no longer takes into account different opinions.
Does not tolerate the presentation of personal attitudes
I was not too surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of members of the Labour Party to be told that they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our mind.
According to my representative, Joan Ryan was similarly brought along because she resolutely opposed antisemitism.
In a proposal for censorship, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironic similar topics that Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with previous leadership.
At the announcement of the meeting of the branch of the Labour Party, Nottingham East on Friday, it was stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I work as a local representative of the Labour Party meeting of the Main Council on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, nowadays, a lot of meetings go through in a different tone, and the promise of a "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment has ever begun.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party’s leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as the associates I thought we were sharing similar political opinions from me began to demand a drastic change of opinion and taking views I would never have agreed with – whether national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – the torrent of offensive words on social networks that invoke my recall, which give up the policies of the center and tell me that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that were addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the avalanche of sexist or racist comments every day, but never give up.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me the most is to tolerate offensive speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer take into account different opinions and that with each proposal of distrust or change of electoral rules we are becoming an increasingly narrow-minded party.
Many times in the last two years I have been advised to bow my head, not to be so loud and telling me that then everything will be fine.”
But I didn’t enter politics because of that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Margaret Thatcher government who left my school multipurpose classroom to decay, I wanted to provide better public services for those who needed them most – either as a local councillor or a government minister.
Never Have I Ever concealed my policy, not even in the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham branch could have been misled by the East regarding my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment when the country is grabbing Brexit that will negatively affect households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy to my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether it is members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat by revocation or political benefit will deter me from acting as I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 Unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have affected the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the day in the Tennant's Premiership League.
Now they have reached the top of the rankings and are the only unranked of ten teams.
Ultimately, top defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reasons to be satisfied.
So far they have tried us on every match and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Every honor to Ayru, they took advantage of opportunities better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, which was excluded by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to withdraw the results, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr eleven before he scored a goal at the half-time itself and realized an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr to 17:5 on the eve of a break.
But Melrose began the second half well and an attempt by Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
That was when a long break occurred due to a serious injury by Ruaridh Knott carried away on the worn ones, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by attempting Stafford McDowall realized by Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card and Melrose again made an additional player pay, by an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to demolish Clima who had no ball; with the line for a criminal blow, MacPherson performed the laying behind Ayr in full swing of penetration.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent a side player Grego Henry to the fifth attempt by the domestic team.

The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out to the sea, hopes that the court will assign it an exit to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the maritime center full of cranes in La Paz.
A flag of ocean color was reported on public buildings.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon ori are the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it.”
In the whole of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost coast in favor of Chile during the conflict due to resources in the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for re-driving on the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is expected on October 1, after a five-year proceeding, these hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, optimisticly expects the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A multitude of Bolivians across the country will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia’s view that Chile, after several decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate the assignment of a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here Morales, a Bolivian charismatic indigenous president facing a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, can also benefit from the verdict on Monday.
We are near the return of the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that few things would change if that were the case.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no powers to allocate the Chilean territory and stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings means that the case was ‘not complex’, said Paz Zárate, Chilean international law expert.
Instead of promoting Bolivia’s interests, they may have been back in the last four years.
The issue of access to the sea was appropriated by the current Bolivian leadership,” Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric buried every good will of Chile, she believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made its decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia a “unusual opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the maritime question as a political crutches.
Bolivia will never waive access rights to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea said there would be no nuclear disarmament if it could not trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never disarm themselves if he could not trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri contacted the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises of the day during the meeting of leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
The commentary suggested that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo soon began diplomatic talks on nuclear issues, which came more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions continued due to “released fantasies” and the U.S. opposition to the Korean War declaration will by no means cast the North on its knees.
Washington is not inclined to support the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps for disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang is widely present to renounce the arsenal that this country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large headgear on the way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
If you want to improve your hat collection or completely shelter the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the catwalk a line of wacky huge headgear for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and delighted lovers of style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
A specimen that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide feather-like rim that completely "taken over" the head of the model.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even pineapple, but these accessories were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a snorkel and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge caps could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a circumference approximately 60 cm wide that was seen on many celebrities, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind an extremely impractical hat subdued by the social networks on the catwalk sent another big creation – a straw beach bag as big as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange rafi bag, decorated with rafi tassels and white leather handle, was an exhibition piece in the summer Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist of the famous and famous, Luke Armitage, said for FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags in luxury stores for the next summer, and since the designer left such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for great fashion accessories.”
John Edward: the language skills that world citizens need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of outstanding exam results, and additional weight is given by individual and joint achievements in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest grades in languages were achieved by participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of foreign language learners have received excellent ratings.
The data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade for Mandarin language, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of employers were unable to fill jobs due to lack of employment with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more workplaces require knowledge of language, these skills are key in a globalized world.
Regardless of career choices, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks multiple languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives her an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouTube survey in which more than 4000 adults participated in 2013, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know a foreign language well enough to be able to communicate in it, and French is the only language that speaks a double-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15%.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today's children.
If children learn multiple languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find a good job.
In Scotland, each school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their program, while others will opt for the languages considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools will always have a varied selection, as well as teaching staff who are competent in this field.
Scottish independent schools provide a learning environment to prepare and arm the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future saves us.
The fact that knowledge of language is very important for the future of each country at the time of global business cannot be ignored, so this must also be reflected in education.
Therefore, knowledge of modern languages should indeed be seen as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellence to young Scots people.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Council of Scottish independent schools
LeBron will play Lakers on Sunday in San Diego for the first time
The fans will soon welcome the first performance of LeBron James for Lakers from Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not yet known how many minutes they will play.
More than one and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told Lakers’ official site.
Lakers’ reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the whole match.
After training at the beginning of this week, James answered questions about his pre-season plans at Lakers consisting of six games.
At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season matches,” he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, a channel on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins the campaign with numerous gatherings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of the five planned sets that Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for the new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose most of the votes in Congress in November.
How many hours does the tonight’s Trump rally start in West Virginia and how can you look at it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19 hours in east weather, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s Western Virginia event online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh who have caused controversy over the charges of sexual abuse.The Senate’s confirmation decision is pending for a week until the FBI investigation has ended.
But the primary goal of this set is to help the Republicans gain an advantage for elections in November.
Therefore, the Trump Presidential Campaign headquarters report that five sets scheduled for the next week aim to “stimulate volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
Most in Congress are so important for the president's plans to travel to as many countries as we enter a turbulent campaign," said Trump's campaign spokesperson for Reuters.
A tonight’s rally that will take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media”, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month on Saturday, with more than 40 percentage points won in that country in 2016.
Trump tries to help a Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia, who lags behind in the polls.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must help him to improve his ranking in polls,” said political scientist Simon Haedar from the University of West Virginia for Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team left their hearts on the ground before the single skirmish on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, a skirmish of couples on Sunday afternoon may be just what it took to reverse the Ryder Cup.
The “wheel of fortune turns” is a saying that is especially true in sports and that athletes believe in, and especially in competitions such as this.
Who is the wheel of happiness now favored?
They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, so I think happiness is currently on our side,” Jordan Spiteth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are advantageous with four points, while the remaining 12 points until the end of the game.
Spiteth says that the Americans received a little wind in their backs and encouraged his play in pairs with Justin Thomas, with whom after a day of play he won three out of four points.
Spieth played killerly from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
Cheerleader celebratory exclamations became louder when the Spiteth and Thomas reached two points behind them, culminating in the key path that the Spiteth reached to the unresolved result.
After the journey that he won the game with 15 holes, a similar fan roar followed, in which hope and faith can be recognized that Americans can turn everything.
You just need to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
These players now only have it left.
18 holes and can be celebrated.
The only players who have won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the sensation of Ryder Cup.
European odd, but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not lose points on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and the Molinaria show that the players that need to be won on Sunday, is not a more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over the Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe both take the victory at the same time on different holes.
But it is still too early to talk about the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly arranged Alexa Noren and Sergia Garcia who had a great performance in the morning game of couples.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes on the playground were buried by Spaniards and Swedes in a hole from which they failed to dig out.
However, on Sunday there will be no one who will help individuals to dig out from their hole.
It is fascinating to watch the games of couples up close because you can see player interactions in pairs, hear the tips they give and those they do not give, as well as study a strategy that can change in the moment.
Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary fighting, in which some, especially Statesside, doubted.
Europeans enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a lead of 10:6
Europeans after Saturday games in pairs in the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the US of 10:6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods took with four points of difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn trying to win the trophy she had left in Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in pairs achieving a score of 3:1.
The American team showed more fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already high.
To win the trophy, the Jim Furyka team needs to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debut to win four points in a row, while he and the Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend just the second couple to win four points in a pair in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods that did not show the best performance in two Saturday games performed some ingenious moves, but now there are 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused his morning fourballs to return to play with his partner Henrik Stenson and experience a 2&1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best player.
But not everything went to Europeans as oiled during a pleasant day south-east of Paris.
The triple winner Jordan Spiteth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set a high ranking for their American team.
First, they defeated the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after the lost first two holes.
Twice throughout the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was behind four points managed to return to the individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, Sunday's counterattack seems to be difficult for them to fall.
North Korea has announced that there is no ‘no chance’ for a one-sided, trustless disarmament
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said before the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase distrust in the United States and that there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm itself and abandon nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly last year that North Korea took “significant measures of goodwill,” for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear station to test and made a decision to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
However, we did not get a satisfactory reaction from the United States,” he added.
If we have no confidence in the US, we have no faith in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will disarm ourselves first unilaterally.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s known complaints of Washington’s resistance to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would gradually abolish sanctions, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at his first meeting in the history of the current U.S. President and leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wanted to officially end the Korean War that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the U.S. made it condition that Pyongyang renounced nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for a reduction in strict international sanctions for North Korea.
The U.S. insists that denuclearisation be carried out beforehand and increase the pressure by means of sanctions in order to forcibly achieve its goal, and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war”, added Ri.
The perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is just a misconception of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases distrust.”
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump that the US President spoke about at the beginning of the week in the United Nations.
But the minister pointed out that Kim and the leader of South Korea Moon Jae-in held as many as three meetings in the last five months and added: “If denuclearization had sought South Korea, not the US, Korean Peninsula denuclearization would not have come to such a halt.”
Regardless of everything, the tone of Minister Rio's speech differed greatly from the last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and stated that targeting the continental U.S. with missiles was inevitable after the evil president Trump called Kim a "human rocket" on a suicidal mission.
Trump, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea this year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that he waited for them a lot more work and that the sanctions had to remain in force until North Korea denuclearized.
Trump said on Wednesday that there was no timeframe for denuclearization and added, "It doesn't matter if it will take two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should award Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation has occurred."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic programme.
Pompeo met with Rome at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea for three times this year, but his last visit has not passed well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but after a few hours, North Korea called it due to "gangster requirements".
North Korea has agreed a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the rocket location and nuclear complex that will be realized if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim had found that those ‘adequate measures’ related to the security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilising relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course to learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat an ever-expanding learning culture with caffeine and sleepless nights.
Academician has found that students at the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed a course that he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with an idea of the course after speaking about the effect of deprivation of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and said: “Why did I find out this only now, at the last year of the faculty?”
She said no one told her how important the dream was, what surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course that takes place for the first time this year explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sports success and generally improve health.
Professor of Psychiatry at the School of Medicine at Harvard and Executive Director of Health Service at Paul Barreira says that the University decided to introduce a course after students noticed a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes an image of a student dormitory where students have to click cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important sleep routine is.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of campuses with interactive icons is shown that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in all-night learning before the exam still exists, says the professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
Professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep.Sleep also helps in the fight against weight gain because the lack of sleep affects the brain, inserts it into the state of fasting and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to come up with a course after attending his lectures at the first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As a next step, he plans to ask all graduates to complete a similar study case before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up.They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic devices screens, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin naked defeating Gerard's boyfriends
Rangers suffered another defeat after the hit of Dolly Menge mown Steven Gerrard’s flawed defense and ended the match by winning Livingston with a score of 1:0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first win after the win in February and score 4:1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, so his team is now eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half time, and Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and did not seem to equate the result.
While Rangers have now fallen to the sixth place, Livingston has climbed to the third with just one goal of difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for Rangers after the line judge Calum Spence got a head injury when an object was dropped from a distance.
Gerrard made eight hip changes and thus counterbalanced next to Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston lineup that took the measure last week and would be delighted that his well-designed lineup suffocated every attempt at the opponent.
Rangers may have had more ball in possession, but Livingston has achieved more with it.
They had the chance to win for two minutes after Menga first kicked out of the game that opened up the space for Scott Pittman to head towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed that opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward an imprecise blow to the rear row.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game it seemed to play with hope instead of belief.
Alfredo Morelos must have considered that the judge should have awarded him eleven in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but judge Steven Thomson did not take into account Colombia’s request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to shoot only two balls towards the goal, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly one blow to the head of Lassan Coulibaly and the tame blow of Oviedo Ejarius was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute gameplay of Livingston slowed down, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers once again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep returned ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who retained his composure and chose Menga to easily complete the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, who had almost immediate effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoy, while Lithgow and Halkett made one long blow after the other.
The Holt side was able to extend leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively prevented Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide inlet from an angle.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was once again late looking for a eleven-year-old because he sparred with Jacobs, but Thomson also turned his eyes this time.
Almanah: Inventor of Geiger counter
And now there is a page from our Almanah on Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and a few days ago ...the day of birth of future physicist Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and from that invention a device known as Geiger counter later developed.
In 1950, Geiger's counter became the main stronghold of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, in which the leading roles were apparently remarkable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What is it, godly?”
Rogers: “It is Geiger’s counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms that react to radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Look at it, it's just heard!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to 'see' bad cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure involves the removal of cells of the immune system from the patient and their modification to the laboratory
Cells are treated to "recognize" the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injected into the patient
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize poor cells, ovarian cancer has withdrawn for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of cells of the immune system from the patient, their modification in the laboratory to know the "recognition" of protein called HER2 which is common to many types of cancer and re-injection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer,” explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting cells of the immune system from the patient and their “learning” to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined Trump's talks on Saturday Night Live and supported him, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Big Again".
It didn't go well
Kanye West was scouted in a studio during Saturday Night Live after a break in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced he would run for President 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening named Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the inscription “Let’s make America great again”, he continued to talk against the Democrats and repeated to support Trump.
I talk so often to the whites and they say to me: How do you like Trump, he is a racist.”
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the American Senate Justice Board on Christine Blasey Ford's claims of sexual abuse.
Although it was not broadcast, a recording of West's speech on social media was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if the release of Rock was trying to order West.
Also, West complained to the audience that they had to blame him behind the stage for the hat he was wearing.
They bothered me behind the stage.
They told me, “Don’t go anywhere with that cap.”
They bullied me!
They said I sank,” Washington Examiner conveys.
West continued: “You want to see the bottom?”, and said he would dress his Superman mantle because it means I can’t tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety wrote that his comments were at least twice disproved by the audience, and Saturday Night Live members seemed embarrassed, while one person for the magazine said, “The whole studio was silent.”
West was invited at the last moment as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
West performed the song "I love it", dressed like a Perrier mineral water bottle, astonished many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, the head of the TPUSA conservative group, who published on Twitter: “One of the people with the bravest spirit: THANK YOU FOR COMPATING Mafia.”
But the show host Karen Hunter announced on Twitter that West was simply “his own and that it was absolutely wonderful”.
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or by supporting his “art”) who I believe accepts and expands the ideology that is detrimental to my community.
It's free.
And we are,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that he was now “officially known under the name Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy’s steps, also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course the deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Charges of attempted killing with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with trying to kill a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant should appear before the Belfast Misdemeanor Court on Monday.
The accusations will be considered by the prosecution.
Star Series Game of Thrones Kit Harington is perpendicular to toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as Jon Snow who is bartering a sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor perpetrated at the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that due to such television roles, boys often feel that they have to be firm in order to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie of the Game of Thrones series, admitted that he wanted to "very resolutely" face this problem.
Personally, I feel very determined at the moment – where did we make mistakes with masculinity?” he asked.
What did we learn from men, as they grew up, in relation to the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to very masculine characters on the screens, could partly be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught through TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they must have those particular features of a man?
I think it is actually one of the great questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for boys.”
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not record the sequels of the Game of Thrones series after her next summer, and said that he “completed with battlefields and horses.”
From November Kit will star in the new performance of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother a robber.
The actor recently found that she felt that meeting wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the shooting of the Game of Thrones.
I met my wife by shooting that series, which gave me so family and future life,” he discovered.
Rose played the role of Ygrita in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Award, the love of Kit’s character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reported a 14% increase in new cases of disease
China has announced that by 14% the population living with HIV and Sido increased.
Healthcare workers say that more than 820,000 people in the country are infected.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases of infection were transmitted by sex, which is a change in relation to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At the conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health authorities stated that people infected with HIV are almost absent in this way.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and Sido increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV virus by sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination is said to be large-scale.
Studies estimate that due to conservative values in the country, 70 – 90 % of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the efforts to deal with this problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has publicly provided information about GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, American MP Maxine Walters refuted the allegations that a member of her staff published personal data of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's website.
A Los Angeles Democratic Representative convinces that these claims spread to the “ultra-right wing” individuals, as well as websites.
Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by an unknown person with Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing regarding claims of sexual misappropriation of candidates of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three Senators examined Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of this information belongs to the Waters representative office, as well as information about the staff member, reported the newspaper The Hill.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false,” continued Waters.
A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These unfounded statements are completely wrong and absolutely false.”
Ms. Waters’ statement quickly attracted critics online, including former White House spokesperson, Ari Fleischer.
This is an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who has been accused of something he has not done must not be angry.
It must not be defiant.
It must not review the accused’s motives.
It must be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Barbara Walters with the criticisms made by Democrats to the judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of feeling too angry during a Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes against Waters in general elections, also spoke on Twitter.
It is important if it is true,” he wrote.
Watersova stated in her statement that her office had informed of these false claims of the ‘important authorities and order authorities’.
We will make sure that perpetrators are discovered and that they bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet,” she continued.
Johnny English Review: Again on Task – Uninteresting Rowan Atkinson Fights Spies
It is already common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and so it seems in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to large screens with the title "Johnny English Rides Again" in 2011.
Will the curled satire of how clearly worthless we are to become a new national export opportunity?
Johnny English's incapable eyes and rubber face again has permission to complicate situations, while the name more than anything tells him that it is a comic creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinematography is not in English.
He is of course a wacky secret agent who, despite his bizarre overtones, resembles the “diluted” glamor to inspector Clousea, has a touch of character to Mr Bean and somewhat resembles that guy who sang one note of the opening ceremony of London’s 2012 Olympic Games.
His character is also inspired by a traveller and a mysterious world man played once by Atkinson in the now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two hot moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and when the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems quite uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" themselves offer comedy elements.
Humor seems to be intended for children and not adults, in my opinion, the wacky adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson’s silent gestures embodied in the character of Mr Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a well-accepted fact.
The hacker entered the UK’s most secret spy web network and discovered the identities of all British agents, at the horror of the agent on duty, played by Kevin Eldon in a short appearance.
This spilled over a glass of Prime Minister's patience, a sublime and a belligerent character experiencing a complete collapse of the system because politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character that should represent Theresa May, but did not get the material with which to do something.
Intelligence advisors reveal that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate the retired agent.
And that person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the director of a classy school, but she teaches how to become a secret agent: here there are a few handsome gegs because English teaches spying in the rocker style.
England quickly leads to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough again, a former partner and his eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married overly enthusiastic submarine commander played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so the two members of the Secret Service of Her Majesty who do everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman of Ophelia Bulletov, who was embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, a vicious Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their exciting journey with absurd and funny occasions: disguised as waiters set a classy French restaurant, causing a huge mess smuggling on Volta’s luxury yacht, and English challenges a complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headsets to find out what the interior of the Volta house looks like.
Everything was done as it should for this last sequel, but no matter how attractive and ostentatious the film is, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
Quite mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I again wondered if the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that would suit his talent?
Labour Party denies to elaborate a plan for British to work four days a week, and to be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan according to which the British would work four days a week and be paid for a five-day work.
The party supposedly wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would be entitled to a three-day weekend with the same salary.
Sources state that the idea could “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country to bow to the interests of workers.
The Trade Union Congress supported the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
The High Spring from the Labour Party said for the newspaper “The Sunday Times”: “Policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
A four-day working week will not be realized overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits the approach this party has towards balancing the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Labour Party does not accept this aspiration in its entirety.
Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not the party’s policy and the party does not consider it.”
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Party’s last week conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to recapture power from the hands of “impersonal directors” and “profits” in utility companies.
Shadow chancellor plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to reclaim their entire stake as the Labour government could make ‘deductions’ based on observed irregularities.
He also confirmed the plans to involve workers in the management boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds in order to give 10% of the capital to private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak for “60 Minutes” about whether FBI investigations about Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI’s investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court in at least a week and asked whether the agency’s conclusion could affect Republic senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked Republic Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was an opportunity for the FBI to discover something that would have led them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said going to the discussion, I said, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called it after it happened, after these allegations were made, and asked, ‘Have you done that?’
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to be carved in stone.
I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and really should be a strong accusation to change it,” he said.
Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett denied everything decisively,” added Graham thinking about Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the persons appointed by her could confirm her claims.
36 years have passed since that.
I don’t see anything changed.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh consecutive year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to the world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen taking into account that he has remained for 12 years to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way of persuading people to demand an invitation to act, or just another case of so-called “clickivism” – where people feel they really change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters seeking to achieve a number of different goals.
He argues that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to over $37 billion by 2030 that will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group stated 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or collected.
The Group estimates that the funds provided so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership between UK investors and developers that advocates “helping children develop to their full potential,” with the promise to provide $35 million from citizens of the world to end malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, like you, we can achieve that social injustice of malnutrition becomes only a footnote in history,” said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador of the “The Power of Nutrition” Foundation, an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that after more than 5000 actions taken to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of the “The Power of Nutrition” project, which will provide nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It will be a long and difficult path, sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, as well as the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger.
Performances by Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawna Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the performances at this year's New York event led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy as a "blocking" to prevent Russian energy exports ̶ Minister of the Interior
Washington may, ‘if necessary’, use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, the US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russian engagement in Syria ̶ especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government ̶ is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in the area as it does in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he says.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
The United States, with the help of a navy, can ensure the openness of maritime routes and a blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke contacted those present at the event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group, which presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement,” he said, and Russia says it is “uses the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made simultaneously with the intention of Trump’s administration to increase the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, thereby replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, Trump's administration officials, including the US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "capture" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of dishonest competition.
I believe that we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a reaction from Germany that reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to steer clear of the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following a recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” the possibility to run for President in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Secretary of State Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would “seriously consider” the candidacy for the president after the mid-term elections.
During an immediate meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running alone.
It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which implies a woman at the head,” The Hill said.
After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the president.”
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during his meeting with the citizens, saying “this country is leading in the wrong direction.”
I’m worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy,” she said.
Warren was openly criticized by Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bretta Kavanaugh.
In a tweet she released on Friday, Warren says, “We naturally need an FBI investigation before voting.”
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don’t think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk / Boston Globe Political Research Centre, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probably” voters stated that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Devil Patrick, with 38 percent votes for potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats discussed in connection with a potential presidential race in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track of Pallin at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence that took place on Monday night
What my son goes through, what he goes through after his return, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds that our soldiers return with,” she told the audience at Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that he was silent about and for his son and other war veterans said they “go back a little differently, return hardened, come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other army members, gave for this country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence against a female person, obstructing the application of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic condition, says Dan Bennett, spokesman for the police administration of Wasilla.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen countries and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new US policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and districts submitted a friendly report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging politics, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v Sessions’ application lodged by the American Union for civil liberties in August was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and violent members of his gang” mistreated her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys-at-law who have supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which comes a large number of asylum applicants in the US, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the US has changed the Immigration Committee decision adopted in 2014 by which immigrants who do not have documents and flee domestic violence are allowed to apply for asylum.
In his statement on Friday, Karl Racine, the Prosecutor General of the District of Colombia, stated that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Federal Law requires all asylum claims to be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the action and such an obstacle infringes that principle,” the report of a friend of the court states.
The lawyers further argued that the policy that denies immigration harms the U.S. economy, claiming that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘ensure the necessary workforce’.
Chief Public Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular group or political opinion,” said Sessions in his policy statement on 11 June.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all problems ̶ even all serious problems ̶ with which people meet every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting harder.
The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusum’s 35-year-old mother, while comforting her boy who was shaking in fever at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances deliver their bodies every minute.
The government of scarcity of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, battling through flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of his back and shoulders, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continuous severe subsequent earthquakes.
His tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking a hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed inside the ruins of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the town for a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Charges China for “Maltreating” via “Propaganda Ads”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published four pages of a long newspaper listing that promoted the mutual benefit of the US and China trade, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of misappropriating the US propaganda press.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday commented on China Daily’s paid newspaper addition in Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere with the US Congress elections on November 6, China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was attempting to interfere in the American elections was marked by what American officials in the Reuters statement characterized as a new phase of Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalated trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's withdrawals at the beginning of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republic Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China, and former Governor of Iowa, China’s chief exporter of agricultural products, said Beijing harmed American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In an article on the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “now doubles this bullying by launching propaganda ads in our own free print.”
Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free print by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
On the contrary, at the newsstand in Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on a disturbing Chinese economic trajectory because the media are under the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
Kavanaugh's debacle Republicans removed voters from the mid-term elections, warning analysts
Since many Republicans stand with the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and defend him on the grounds of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming mid-term elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were very turbulent, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their voice.
Such things cannot be restored,” said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed suspicion that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday ̶ will not forget it either tomorrow or November”, said Karina Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, citing the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning the protesters sang: “The November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hall, while the Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee were preparing to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reports Mic.
Enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
People say they are already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although disliked by the president, often do not go out to elections.”
Even before the public testimony to Ford described in detail her claims of sexual assault by the Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that there might be a negative reaction if the Republicans proceed with the certificate.
It is a real confusion for the Great Old Party,” said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the last week, according to NBC News.
It is not just about voting in a committee or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to a reserve bench, but also about the way Republicans approached and treated it all,” said Guy Cecil, the Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps in the choice of democracy.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about whom they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more tilting to him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in the authenticity of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent stated that they trust Kavanaugh safely or probably.
In addition, 38 percent stated that he thinks Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford has stated, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court judge’s candidate showed her genitalia at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competition to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that develops based on Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the place of storage of their data and people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee found that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination".
We have to do it now,” he said thinking about startup.
This is a historical moment.
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access the information completely of the user.
The company calls this “personal empowerment via data”.
The idea for Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help Solid be accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who have signed a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of voluntary programmers.
Starting this week, developers from all over the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change in which all of their business models would turn completely overnight.
We do not ask for their permission.
In a press release on Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the High Priests of the First World War Victoria Cross
The celebration in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victorian Cross as a fighter in the First World War was held in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he was awarded the highest British military honor.
Memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandchildren on a prowl in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that “is incredibly symbolic” that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s venture for which he received this recognition.
According to a report by London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Lieutenant Vann led his battalion over St. Quentin's channel "through a very dense fog and under strong fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine gun".
Later he rushed to the front and with an "incredibly brave" led the unit forward before he rushed to the Polish cannon without anyone's help and mowed three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed German sniper on 4 October 1918 ̶ just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said his grandfather's works were "something I know I could never achieve, and that stirs humility".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade orchestra.
Michael Vann said he “feels very honored to take part in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give.”
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got the Piggy Peppa
Imagine staying awake all night long to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually prevent you from following the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and were featured in the UK at night on channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for each other’s match, viewers in the UK remained shocked when the broadcast was interrupted by the Peppa Pig.
Many were not at all impressed after only because of the fight they remained awake until the early morning hours.
One fan of ending the transmission with a children's cartoon on Twitter described as "a kind of sick joke".
According to the state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 am, so they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Communications Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
Jupi, ‛Pestric Peppa‛.
President Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include UK viewers in the future as well.
When I consider reruning, I think we probably can handle something,” Coker said.
But the transfer is there on six mornings on Sunday and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when they will already be Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transfer was interrupted, they circulated many correspondences that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. The problem is state nature.
I can promise you that the next time it will not come.
We will keep five fights instead of six ̶ what we normally do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we were exaggerated.
The unfortunate circumstances are at stake.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “inferior” in terms of sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority over the others because of his sexuality ̶ but this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old stated that until he went to high school, he was not aware that “not everyone is like me”.
In his statement for Radio 4 Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of gays to give others “hope”.
He also said that winning at the Olympic Games has been less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, took a few months of rest for illness.
As a renegade in Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" compared to the rest because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said, "To date, these feelings of inferiority and diversity compared to other things that gave me the power and strength to succeed."
He says he wanted to prove that he was “someone and something”, so as not to disappoint anyone when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medal became a prominent person who advocates LGBT people and used his performance on this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he believes that he is happy that he can live openly without consequences and because he wanted to give others a “hope”.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised by the fact that he fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black’s man, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said that his age difference never represented a problem.
When so young people are going through so much,” he commented on his first Olympic game when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later,” he said that it was difficult to find someone in the same years and that he had experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “whole perspective” changed.
If you asked me last year, all the story would be about having to win a gold medal,” he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold Olympic medals.
Robbie is my gold Olympic medal.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets for London in 2012 ̶ because he wanted to be in the first place.
I couldn’t say, ‘Daddy, you won’t be here long enough to be in the first place’,” he said.
I held him by the hand as he breathed out, and only when he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible,” he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life about to jump in front of the local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also an inspiration to choose the first song "Proud" by singer Heather Small ̶ that echoed in it during the preparation for the Olympic Games and to which it is always the most difficult.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Michaelson out of shape on a bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match of Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his form to avoid an inconvenient turning point.
Michaelson, who plays a record-breaking twelfth time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench on Saturday games with four balls and quads.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he was often for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and elaborating his game on the training ground in the hopes of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most accurate player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for the demanding terrain Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes imprecise blows.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, he faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who won the Tommy Fleetwood in all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual matches with four points less, reach the hot start, the american match could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man ̶ more than that and could not say.
He fully understood the role he played today, patted me on his back, embraced me and said that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk said.
There is a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
It is certain that I did not imagine playing two games.
I imagined that there were more of them, but it turned out that way and we thought we needed to do it that way.
She wants to be on the field, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Michaelson will overtake the record of Nick Falda by the number of matches played by Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven half-times, although Furyk said his presence brought certain intangible values to the team.
He is ridiculous, sarcastic, humorous, likes to joke with people and is a great guy for that,” he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from the experience that a big advantage in the last day of individual matches Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
He debuted in the 1997 Valdrama match, where the team of Captain Seve Ballesteros had an advantage of five points over the Americans, but the game was finished with their victory with a narrow difference of 141⁄2 ̶ 131⁄2.
You are constantly reminded that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a tight difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after observing the team in 2018 that won the score of 5 ̶ 3 on Friday and yesterday led the result of 10 ̶ 6 on the field of Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play with full force.
Go out to the field and do everything right.
Nothing is almost until the floors on the board are advertised.
We have a goal, and it is to try to win this trophy, and it remains a focus on it.
I speak all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware who stands opposite us ̶ the biggest players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “In this I would never run before the ore.
Tomorrow it is necessary to face a different beast.
Tomorrow are the main individual performances, and this is something completely different.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you’re there as an individual, your golfers’ abilities are at the ultimate test.
It is a message that you have to convey to players, and she is that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he also has to give the best of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his fellow on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with teammates, excluding Jordan Spiteth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these great twists on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser after Europe performed a “miracle in the Medina”.
I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question that Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should strive to achieve excellent results at the very start like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that turn goes in a certain direction, he puts a lot of pressure on medium matches.
Accordingly, we organized our lineup and placed the guys as if we would, you know, try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead a counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter to face other Europeans in the upper half.
I decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it encompasses everything,” Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
German new warship again put on hold
The latest German Navy frigate was to be put into operation in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War era, but will not be ready at least until the next year due to faulty systems and increased costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ ship, a leading ship of brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, reports to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesperson.
The ship was to join the navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery hit the fate of an ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
As far as it is known, it will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period ̶ should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to the home port.
However, constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships ̶ that are said to allow Germany to show power abroad ̶ by the time of entry into service will already become obsolete, noted Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate came to all covers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to let the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for returning, but the German media cited a number of key “software and hardware defects” that would make a warship useless if it were sent to a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships would operate a crew of about 120 sailors ̶ half the size of the Bremen class on older frigates.
Also, it has been shown that the ship is dramatically too heavy which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ of 7000 tonnes is twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project ̶ including crew training ̶ also becomes a problem.
It is said that the price reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) ̶ compared to the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that affect the latest frigates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament’s Defence Committee, acknowledged that naval ships actually ‘fancy ships capable of deployment’.
The official said that this problem has increased over time, because the old ships were out of operation, and there were no replacement vessels.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the navy.
National Foundation eavesdrops the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and wetland dwarf bats, as well as brown long-lived and river bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile inspections using manual detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat vote and what kind it does.
Then a habitat map and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and landscaping works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as well as fly rods and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and cat attacks of pets.
Bats are actually not blind.
However, due to their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use sophisticated echolation technique to find bugs and obstacles in the trajectory of their flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescue.
The organization even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threeave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says that the property is an ideal area for them.
Here at Threeave we have a huge space for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there is still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and on other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since unintentional destruction of a litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Bat Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don’t know how their population thrives.”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo marked the charges for rape brought against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published these accusations.
Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her 375 000 dollars to keep silent about the incident, reported on Friday Der Spiegel.
In a live video that posted on Instagram for his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldo, 33 criticized the allegations as “false news”.
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” says the five-time winner of the Golden Ball in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they called "an unacceptable report on privacy concerns," says Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would claim compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, as reported, returned to the footballer's room, where he supposedly raped her anal, is stated in the documents filed in the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after an alleged incident and told him that “99 percent” was a “good guy” he had let go of that “one percent.”
Documents argue that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and photographed her injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to the out-of-court settlement because she was "stricken retaliation" and made sure she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-old says she now wants to cancel the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to the Italian giant Juve as part of the 100 million euros crossing.
Brexit: the UK will “be regretted forever” for losing its car manufacturers
UK will “repent forever” if after Brexit it loses the status of world leader in car production, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that, in case Britain left the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of waiting at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston ̶ plant produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis ̶ produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience production downtime at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini Factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer concerns the supply chain risks in the event of a Brexit without an agreement reached.
Toyota’s production line operates according to the “just on time” principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be a breakdown on the border that the industry says could lead to a delay and a lack of parts.
Toyota at its factory in Derbyshire would not be able to keep more stock than those needed for a day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the “Chequers” plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was “ precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
We want to reach the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity,” said BBC Radio 4 for today’s program.
The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful range of supply chains.”
At Toyota, they could not say how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and eventually lead to job loss.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a member of the union of the United, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after these jobs leave, they never come back again.”
Government spokesperson says: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
An important meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred for another week” as the White House said about the candidate for the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller’s work, who investigates the involvement of Russia in elections, ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and any obstruction of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump will release the deputy public prosecutor, and thus jeopardize Mueller’s independence, has been scattering gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a wire to record talks with Trump and the ability to remove presidents through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the middle of an announcement that he would just resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, who was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not have “loved” to dismiss Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlapping with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the actions against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “The date was not set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to inform the press about everything.”
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders did not hold a press conference in the White House from September 10th.
Head Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not a consequence of the repulsion towards “theater behavior” of television Rapporteurs, although she said: “I will not oppose the fact that they are flaunting.”
She then announced that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
The President arranges more meetings for answers to questions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing any evidence: “We analyzed the figures.”
Short addresses will continue to happen, Sanders said, "if journalists have the opportunity to ask the President directly, it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We strive to make this possible often, and you could see it in the last few weeks, and it is precisely that you can speak to the President of the United States that will replace short addresses to journalists.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president may also show why, by free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the gathered journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the staff of the EU employed in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed to meet the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal continued during the summer, which are moving according to the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government also reinforces preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is certainly a very difficult period for all of you.
That’s why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie subjected to emergency surgery after head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers line player, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday's defeat of Vanderbilt Commodores with a score of 31 ̶ 27, reports by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee Chief Trainer, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-time.
He came to the line of the playground and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on a stretcher and sending it for further tests.
Representative of Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had gone out of operation at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there is no ‘details on the type/scope of injury’ and that Tennessee State tries to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of experience, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five knock-offs before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 knock-offs in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help the homeless
This step will neutralize the success of Corby's efforts to attract young voters
An increase in the fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year ̶ to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying a property in the UK ̶ and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be understood as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
An increase in the fee will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will contribute to Government efforts to fight homelessness.
The additional fee ̶ that is added to the current fee, including the increase that was introduced two years ago to other homes and properties purchased for the issuance of ̶ can be up to three percent.
The treasury expects 120 million pounds to be collected annually with this move.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by residents who are not resident in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first property to get involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country ̶ especially in the capital ̶ have become “cities” due to the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy followed only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a fee reduction to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs. May to give up quotas on cost-effective real estate to fix the “disgrace for the living situation” in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of any eviction induced.
He also wants to give the councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that the life of each new generation should be better.
And this means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies established abroad, can buy homes as easily as valuable British.
The dream of owning a home has become too far for a large number of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland”
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his “end ambition” is one day to become Scotland’s manager.
Scotland (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the north-eastern club, which currently occupies third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading one.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after again led St. Mirren last season at the Scottish Football Championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and that always dragged me back.
However, this opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in club management.”
Ross' predecessors on the site of Sunderland, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neillo, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Cania.
Former boss Allo Athletica says he did not feel afraid because he inherits such famous names in such a large club, having previously rejected calls in Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success for me at the moment will be measured according to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
It is not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross reaches his third year of managerial career, after a period during which he was assistant boss in Dumbarton and a 15-month experience as part of Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of falling out to the champions of the next season.
Ross says she feels more comfortable than ever during her toy career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Probably it was a real intersection,” recalled Alloe’s takeover.
“I really believed that management is what suits me, more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I managed well, made solidly and enjoyed quite successful moments.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through every week.
I’m still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing.
I always wanted to manage it and now I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever felt in my life.”

The perfect time for pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, as the research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenues to British pubs that struggled with finances, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars generated revenue growth in July by 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from a business consultation of the General Manager’s Office, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and the participation of England in the World Cup that lasted longer than expected meant that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, with restaurants now even more affected.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant revenues in June only deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have made much larger gains under equal conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mainly served have also been damaged due to the heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to get out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales grew 6.6% over the month, and food sales declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, an RSM holiday and catering analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the external market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle with difficulties, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per annum will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not come in the time up for food managers, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a much-needed break.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, stood at 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the deceleration of brand share growth.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses 47 operating group performance data, with a total turnover of over £9 billion, and an industrial reference value is established.

Research reveals that one in five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
Testing 20 000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta sites

Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account that shows parents
One of the five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey of 20 000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Insta” accounts ̶ reference to the photo-sharing website.
The news has boosted the fear of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a clean “main” account to show their parents while having private accounts at the same time.
A mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me”.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, half of whom acknowledge that they own private accounts.
Head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
The Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to take advantage of her extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be an athlete's voice and hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a 200 and 400-meter race in 1996 at the games in Atlanta, of his four Olympic gold, and now a regular BBC expert, after a passing ischemic attack, could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time will show whether to recover and to what extent.
It was strenuous, but fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
Split reviews online about a breast pump ad that compares mothers with cows
The breast pump manufacturing company compares mothers to cows that aroused their muse by sharing opinions online.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be the world’s first silent wearable breast pump, Elvie announced a commercial inspired by an ironic video to show the freedom the new breast pump gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a stable full of hay and cows with music, whose text reads: "Yes, I'm milking but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, this is not a udder, it's my breasts."
Then follow the chorus: “Pump, pump, feed the baby with it, pump, pump, milk your ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the internet.
With 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it shed light on the "horriages" of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising of this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stealing a few days after birth,” wrote one person.

The other person comments: “Intelligible traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "Fully free advertisement."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was "smile".
I think this is an ingenious idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Milk dispensing made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I realized it the way it is.
This is an ingenious product,” she said.
The other person commented: “This is a fun advertisement aimed at milking moms (often at their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discreet breast pumps placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who betray milk say that they feel like cows.
The Elvie breast pump, however, is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the nursing bra, allowing women to move freely, keep their babies and even go out during betrayal.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s breast pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between the presentation of women and cows, we wanted to put the issue and all its challenges at the center of attention, and at the same time, in a fun and understandable way demonstrate the incredible feeling of freedom that the new breast pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie breast pump came to the covers.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children retained increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump’s administration made it more difficult to accommodate children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and were afraid to threaten their own possibility of staying in the country by acting and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested were not recorded in criminal records earlier.
Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue the search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
According to the statements of shelter workers, with the aim of faster conducting the procedure for children, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, and not after 60 days, which was the standard earlier.
Many will appear via a videoconference call, not in person, to bring their case before the court of immigration to obtain legal status.
Those who do not meet the criteria for assistance will be quickly deported.
According to the statements of the shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outages or attempts to escape.
Proponents said that these concerns are expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling to overlook.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders the U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Moualem, who is also a Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “as it would be treated accordingly.”
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he said to the congregation.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people died since 2011, while millions remained without their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue the "fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories were cleared" by terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly practice and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 soldiers on the ground in a war-torn country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that prompted refugees not to return.
We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no help to rebuild Syria until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack of Syrian forces with the support of Russia in a province inhabited by three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including the Al-Qaeda-related fighters from the Nusra front, ‘to be eradicated’.
UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of government and opposition to put together a postwar constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to ‘reviewing the articles of the current constitution’ and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Second Term
According to this logic, Mr Trump should win the 2020 reelection unless, many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the recall and the scandal end prematurely his presidency.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!”
There are currently no signs of fatigue for the viewer.
Since 2014, ratings in prime terms have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in impact time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and MSNBC's show "The Rachel Maddow Show" surpassed the ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on broadcast nights of major news.
It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Identified Survivor” drama, about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Because she makes me laugh,” Ms. Scovell told me.
In chaos there is a fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of the abortion law derived from the Roe against Wade procedure, whether immigration families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Shutdown is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged viewers.
However, you exceed the level of informed citizens when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for the sixth hour discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of “deep backgrounds” for his book “Fear”, about the ostrich jacket of Paul Manafort worth $15 000 (“the arrogance-packed garment”, writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, anatomy of Mr Trump given by Stormy Daniels.
For example, I will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
Part of what he does to experience him as a reality show is that he feeds you with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of the “pawnshop” show, about the rotating cast and the daily plots of Trump’s show (fighting with N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss any episode because you’ll fall behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleissa this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of Kauai Island it was sunny at a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside and watched MSNBC and at the same time filmed CNN.
He could not be separated from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hanged on the end.
I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’, Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out that they were right.”

Cash on the outside flows into the most uncertain mid-term election race for the congress
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania experiences a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congress districts resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently reorganised suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights the Democrat Conor Lamb ̶ who won a place in another district last spring in special elections.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally tailored for the benefit of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign financing between the main party financial fundraisers, the Committee that collects funds for the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed special March elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
This position was held by Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political analysts gave a slight advantage to Democrats.
The U.S. is valid if they need to punish El Salvador for providing support to China and then withdrawing
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with a small resistance to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump’s organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to invite US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” spokesperson Heather Nauert said.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which include a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue on a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus ended any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should turn to the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the administration that he attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions provided anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next thing to be prepared could be Robert Mueller’s special investigator’s report on a possible Trump’s obstruction of justice, of which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller, as reported, also directed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our choices.
If the majority change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to retire before the voters, and perhaps ultimately with the jury of the flats.
There are many of these "if" and I do not want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Trum - or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to make a coup against Hitler, only to have the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump releases the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, a man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since these newspapers reported that he secretly proposed recording the president last year and speculated on his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
How will we answer if the recently commissioned investigation of the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair ̶ or is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations for sexual assault and dishonest witnessing?”
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for Congress that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter sleep.
But I believe that we will not fall because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, whom he deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once stood in my home of ambassadors.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to ignite candles for a floppy on that table with a hooked cross.
With such a legacy, how not to be optimist about our future?”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapida from Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel, they will put them in a strong position to qualify from the Group G of the European League.
The knee injury prevented an ally of Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in a season to a 2 ̶ 2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can take advantage of this result as a springboard for larger things.
It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” said 31-year-old.
We entered the game believing that we can achieve something and we pulled a point.
Perhaps in the end we could have stolen the match, but, generally, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
On Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope that we can win three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I am sure that we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, among everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy; the training is good.
Let’s hope that we will be able to continue now, leave behind last season and be successful.”
Women cannot sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
Around half of respondents to the Nationwide study said they talked with their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the provision of care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method.
Your choice of long-term care financing can include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth ̶ as long as you have money.
Arrange your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Hire healthcare representatives to determine a reliable person who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your preferences in case you cannot communicate.
Also, consider giving a power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your aged parent is in a situation that requires immediate medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Provide details in writing to be ready.
“It’s not just about finances, but who are doctors?” Martin asked.
What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand.”
A man shot repeatedly from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot by shots from the air rifle as he returned home after a night out.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arms.
The police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, officials said, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
As communications were interrupted, the assistance officers could not receive any information from the province of Donggale, a region north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree earthquake epicenter.
After the catastrophe, more than 16 000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the Sulawesi province economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also hit West Donggal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami hit by 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niasa, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, causing tsunami to hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, provoking a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and the 2004 tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
The eldest son of Sara Palin arrested for accusations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice-president, Sare Palin, was arrested for charges of attack.
Palin (29), from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and opposition to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the state police officer Alaska.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to summon the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and is retained on an unsecured $500 bond, reports to KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he said of the guilty guilty, “innocent, of course,” the network reported.
Pallina is charged for three Class A violations, which means it could be in prison for up to a year and fined $250 000.
He is also accused of a Class B violation, which is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2000.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, invited the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Court of Veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of family violence, obstruction of applying for domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic condition related to an incident.
His girlfriend stated that she hit her face.
Sara Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted, and in the coming days there is an increase in the number of killed.
The earthquake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at the beach festival in the city of Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a terrorist attack suspect in New York where eight people were killed ̶ a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used the Home Depot shop rental truck to attack the bike path along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed pedestrians and cyclists on his way to October
In order to justify the death penalty, the applicants will have to prove that Sai’s ‘intentionally’ killed eight victims and ‘intentionally’ inflicted a serious personal injury, in accordance with the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points result in a possible death penalty, in accordance with the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal large jury of Saipov struck an indictment of 22 points involving eight charges for murder and extortion, which the federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, and charges for the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required ‘significant planning and foreshadowing’, according to the applicants, describing the way Saipov performed it as ‘nerd, cruel and corrupt’.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernano Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca,” it said in the notice of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern district was last prosecuted by a death penalty.
The indictee, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to a lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in the New York state in 1953, when the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg couple were executed after being sentenced to a spy conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on 19 June 1953 on an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to report the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He stated that he was not guilty at 22 points of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, and not to accept the guilty for life in prison without being able to release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defence team had previously asked the applicant not to seek a death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the People's Army" during the protests at the Conservative Conference.
The former head of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to “feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, since one of the Members of Parliament Theresa May proposed that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said the parade in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have been “exit” if Mr. Farage had been Secretary for Brexit so far.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May in the reconciliation of his deeply divided orders is underlined by the Toryians who join a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to keep his “Chequers” compromise plan in the midst of Brexit supporters, keepers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that they would continue to attempt to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction ̶ and force the Eurosceptics and Labours to choose between its package and ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone said at the campaign set “Leave Means Leave” in Solihull that he wanted to “reject Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have received the title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been the main one, we would have already come out,” he said.
A member of the parliament from Wellingborough added, “I’ll fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.”
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British changed their opinion and wanted to remain completely incorrect.”
Conservative and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in the procession, addressing journalists with the words: “Just say: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out into the streets and chose us.
Please reject Chequers and start listening.”
In a prominent message, Mrs. May added: “Premières retain their jobs when they fulfill their promises.”
Farage said that politicians had to force themselves to "feel the pressure" if they were to fail the decision made on the referendum in 2016.
Now it is a matter of trust between us ̶ people ̶ and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to issue Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'it won't pass you'.
In the message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of issuing Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the nation’s army of the country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not settle until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A multitude of activists were largely transparent to the “Torijevci protiv Brexit” after the launch of the group this weekend.
Laborist Lord Adonis mocked conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party’s application during the opening of the conference.
These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the “Canada plus” plan for a smooth state of border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democratic woman spoke about her future on Saturday at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent critic of Donald Trump, is running for a November reelection against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation for some time to be able to oppose Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting at Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to run for the president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and this entails a woman at the head.”
Arrest for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she had arrested a shooting suspect with the deadly outcome of the Louisiana State University basketball player (LSU) by Wayde Sims that took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police published information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at the ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a murder recording, asking for help in identifying the man with the recording.
Sims (20) was killed early on Friday near the Southern University campus.
Wayde Sims received a bullet wound and eventually died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was tested and admitted he was on the scene of the crime and owned a weapon and killed Wayde Sims.
Simpson is arrested without incidents and detained in the East Baton Rouge county police.
Sims, a third-year-old 198 cm tall student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in the 10 first matches last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion title after his ranking ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team’s order would play a big role in the race.
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and inviting Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to get into traffic at the back, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes entered boxing one round later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action wheel that made Ferrari reluctantly leave the free interior at risk of lagging behind after a double move to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen went from the last row and was the seventh to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large portion of the race as he trusted his tires to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and the real gentleman allowed me to pass.
The team did a truly extraordinary job to achieve a formational finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for her insisting that she had not released a letter by Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of Sexual Abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and nasty and insincere.”
The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and insincere,” he said.
When you look at the public disclosures and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I haven’t done it.
I didn’t do that.’
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave the information?
Remember her response... have you released a document to the public - ‘aa, what?
Oh, no.
I am not.’
Wait a minute.
We let go ... No, we’re not,” he added, imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein sent a letter in July with details of Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not put her story in public,” Feinstein said to the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to keep her secret and kept her secret, which she was looking for.”
However, her denial did not come to the approval of the president, who commented on the meeting on Saturday evening: "If I told you something - it was a very bad body language.
It may not be, but I have never seen a burning body language in my life.”
Continuing his defence of candidates for the Supreme Court, accused by three women for sexual abuse, the president suggested that Democrats use these accusations for their own goals.
They are determined to restore power at any cost.
See evil, disgust, they don’t care who will hurt, whom they have to run over in order to come to power and control,” says President Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 ̶ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars abolished for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday victory in Dundee on Saturday by score of 5 ̶ 3.
Giants in the early minutes came to the advantage of two naked shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the national to equilibrium, and then Dwyer returned the Giants to lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who came from the background and beat Dundee 2 ̶ 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the two teams season, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening of the match arrived in the fourth minute, more precisely at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead with the goal of Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the hectic opening of the game, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants ended the first third with the lead when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The domestics regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalize their forces by naked at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen to lead Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of winning when his team was already halfway to victory in the last third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five games, are hosts of the team from Milton Keynes in the next match on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he was killed while securing a safe take-off of aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many were watered as after the big earthquake that hit Sulawesi island on Friday and caused tsunami.
Strong earthquakes still affect the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace in the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri control tower, which swinged strongly.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of Batik Air aircraft on a flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived to Palu.
Our heart breaks because of this,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of killed could reach thousands of people, and the state disaster relief agency says that limited access to the cities of Donggali, Sigi and Boutong.
It is believed that the number of killed continues to increase, since many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not even reach it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
The waves reaching a height of up to six meters destroyed Pal, in which a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said for Sky News: “Emergency vehicles are bringing their bodies every minute.
The government of scarcity of clean water.
Small shops are plundering everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said for CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to aid the survivors, but we don’t know what to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Pal on Sunday and said to the country's army: "Please do everything day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is running like missing after a lagoon plane accident
An airline that owns an aircraft crashing into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being carried out as missing, having previously been said that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the aircraft that was sinking.
In his statement, Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they cannot trace one of the passengers.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in trying to find the person in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the aircraft fell into water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were kept in hospital on Saturday, and that they were all in a stable state.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane had missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the aircraft flew very low.
It's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others managed to break through the water that reached their waist to the exit in the event of the danger of the sinking aircraft.
He said that stewardesses panicked and shouted, and that he suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who worked near to repair docks also helped to rescue using a inflatable boat to transport people to land before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters of water.
The aviation security network data indicate that 111 people were killed in an air carrier PNG accident in the last two decades, but none of them were included in the Air Niugins.
Analyst exhibits a time review of the night in which the woman is burned alive
The prosecution ended on Saturday the case in a retrial to a man accused of incineration a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the American Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used data from his cell phone to put together a puzzle about the movement of a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers evening when he was killed, which contradicts his previous claims, reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at a time when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “stacked, because his truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The data from the cell phone indicated that they knew each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, a certain time after Chambers' death, had deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
He wiped it out of his life,” said Hale.
Defense should start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude to the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed singing group argues that hip-hop music has moved away from its beginnings filled with political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to return to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
Babysitter from New York sues a couple for cancellation after a "racist" message
The New York nanny sues the couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from a mother in which she calls her "one more black girl".
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the accusation with the "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dissatisfaction when, upon her arrival on the first working day of 2016, she learned that the new babysitter of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black girl.
NEEEE ANOTHER BLACKER,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in her message to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a “convenient” situation, and dismissed Mrs. Maurice, for saying that their former nanny, who was an African-American woman, was badly doing her job, and that she instead expected a Filipino, transmitted the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day of work, and then went home.
Now Maurice sues the cancellation fee pair and asks for a $350 compensation per day for a period of six months for which she was originally engaged, although without a contract.
I want to show them that they can’t do such things,” he told Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple reiterated the claims that the racists, saying that the end of Maurice’s employment was reasonable, because of the fear that the insult would not be trusted later.
My wife didn’t think what she was sending in the message.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist,” Joel Plasco’s husband told Post.
But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Oh give.”
Plasco said that his wife received only two months of maternity leave after the birth of the child and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
You will sue someone who is in such a situation
It’s not very nice,” added an investment banker.
Although court proceedings are still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social networks, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not identify themselves with a talking teddy bear, it is revealed in a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says: "It is difficult to put himself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It’s very fun what we now know about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as BBC's cinematographer before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, was optimistic when his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
Of Paddington, which she describes as a “very important family member”, she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
He was pretty a man and he was not a boasting man,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything was perceived as an achievement of your own child: you are proud of it even though none of it is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was observed that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed his merits exclusively to Paddington.”
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye by phone
After landing, her daughter was urgently transported to the Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
He called over regularly to say that he was really bad and that he believed he would not get away,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
What I did.
I said, “Tashi, baby, I love you a lot.
I'll join you soon.
I will join you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to maintain her heart function were slowly losing effect and leaving her body's system.
She died shortly before boarding and then everything went out.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what would follow.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning for her daughter’s loss, boarded the plane along with other passengers – who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
No one knew,” she said.
I lowered my head, and my tears flowed down my face all the time.
It is hard to explain, but on the flight I felt a great feeling of condolences to Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages of women in mourning on the bridge with the aim of preventing suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place cards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he was suicided.
I don’t want no parent to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile waiting for a dazzling career.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could have filled every room with joy.”
However, before his death, he left his job because he was in a "real dark state".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I keep worrying about this going to have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with an idea with cards “so people know there’s someone you can go and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Do not sit in silence ̶ you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davies’ longtime friend, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was at the very bottom of ̶ when the children opened the gifts, he did not look them in the eyes or wanted anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they must overcome it: “All this leaves a large cavity in the family.
Kida us.
But we will continue on and fight.”

Bretta Kavanaugh's future hangs on the thread as the FBI begins an investigation
I thought we could bring a little unity if we could really get something like what was looking for a time and scope limited investigation,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was “breaking down” in the midst of a rooted party blockade.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was fueled by the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections arrive in just five weeks, November 6th ̶ if, what is expected, the Republicans do not go well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to bring the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly invites senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI creates its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to break with a decisive vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
Number of escapes from North Korea 'falls' under the guidance of Kim
The number of escapes from North to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislature said.
Referring to the data of the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said last year there were 1127 escapes ̶ compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors are stricter control at the border crossing between North Korea and China, and the higher fees that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of north-to-north getaways eventually gained South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Korea.
China considers escapes to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South ̶ that are still technical in the war ̶ have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the halt negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historical meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work on the liberation of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions for not making any progress since.
Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and it does not come to mind that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm,” Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is incapable of serving the Supreme Court
The opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called the judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was unable to serve the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t without thinking that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would call herself ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanagh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the claims that he was sexually abused by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "grotesque and coordinated desquamation" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not participate in the Supreme Court’s work, as he showed that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way in which Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats are attacking,” she said.
When asked if he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi backed up.
I will say the following if he does not speak the truth to Congress or FBI, then he is not capable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but not in the court in which he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a democratic woman, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law derived from the Roe against Wade procedure, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed the questions about whether to modify some Supreme Court decisions.
It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Is it not wonderful’, Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticisms, the anger that has gathered for months and years cannot be gargled without crying.
We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don’t think it’s unusual, what do you think?”
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who was once the executive director and who said that she was crying when she got angry, but she developed the technique that, when she got angry and started crying, the person she spoke to says: ‘Perhaps you think I am sad because I cry.
I’m angry.’”
And then she continued.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as an output for anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, once I cried for an unspeakable rage, one older woman ̶ a cold manager I was always afraid of ̶ dragged me to the stairs.
Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad, so they’ll be glad because they’ll think they hit you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Colorado Democratic Congress, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a suburban affair on the Monkey Business ship and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why he would not consider the idea to run for the president.
It wasn’t a well-designed decision,” she told me through laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Since the campaign has already been advanced, it has been lagging behind with fundraising, and has vowed not to enter the race if it does not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters, who gave her 1000 dollars for men, gave her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?”, she wondered.
While she was saying that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions ̶ gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration about the system that made it difficult to collect money and target voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism ̶ that her throat was squeezed.
You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schroeder’s reaction of the media to her.
You would think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what to put on my tombstone.
She cried.
How a trading war between the US and China can be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war resonated loudly and, while the battle is far from the end, the split between countries can be of benefit to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, American president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation in this week appeared with new tariffs that affected products worth $200 billion ($150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing returned in some way, and a tariff of five to ten percent to 60 billion US commodities was recently introduced.
China has promised that the U.S. will be hit, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not be handed over soon.
The withdrawal of Washington could be achieved by easing demands, but public submission to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the American trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependency of the two economies.
The fact that a fast-paced political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions to trigger economic dumbness in both countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals to help rebuild a country that has destroyed a war lasting more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions improved.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the area destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
Now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and existence are met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the U.S. team with the final score of 16.5 ̶ 10.5 on the field of Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again won the crown while the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14.5 points they were supposed to win the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who struggled during almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole par 3, sent the ball into the water at the first shot, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds and became one of the 4 players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the tournament started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth ejected Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran Eight Ryder Cups, Spain’s Sergio Garcia, became European with the most wins in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop the tears.
The year was difficult.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy that I won the cup again.
It’s all up to the team, I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said, full of emotions after European victory.
He conveys a torch to his compatriot John Ram, who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 at single games on Sunday.
I feel incredible pride over the victory over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, which won 14 major titles, and is located right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After his team’s disappointing performance, American captain Jim Furyk said, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.”
At certain times we have resisted Europe.
We didn't succeed.
I take off my hat to Thomas.
It is an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll go over and work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee, so we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You need to remove the cap to people.
We’re superimposed.”
New data on red tide: Concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Flora and Wildlife Florida (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of red tides in parts of Tampa Bay Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions of heterogeneous algal bloom are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatea, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier ̶, which indicates a decrease in concentrations.
Red tide stretches about 130 miles along the coast from the northern part of Pinellas district to the southern part of Lee district.
The areas of flowering can be found about 10 miles from the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
Red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
In the past week, midpoint concentrations were recorded in Pinellas County or the associated offshore area, low to high concentration in the offshore area of Hillsborough, common to high concentration in Manatea County, common to high concentration in the Sarasota County or associated offshore area, common to medium concentration in Charlotte County, common to high concentration in Lee County or the associated offshore area, and low concentration in Collier County.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
