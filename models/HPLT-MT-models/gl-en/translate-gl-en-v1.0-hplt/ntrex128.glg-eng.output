Members of the Assembly of Wales care about them “who take them for puppets”
Conservation between some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to in English AM, by the suggestion that they should change the name of the MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose by the planes to change the name of the assembly by Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama fears to be subject to ridiculing.
A Labour Party member said that his group worried that the new name “rima with Twp and Pwp”.
For those who do not know Welsh, “twp” means “parvo” and “wp” means “caca”.
A member of the game Plaid Cymru said that the group's "not content" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservator said that his group maintained an "open mind" in the song to the change of name, but stressed that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal jump.
In this context, the letter “w” in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the English pronunciation of Yorkshire of the letter “u”.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently writing the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: “For all cases, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves”.
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 granted the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation carried out on these proposals that showed much support to the name of Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the topic of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of Parliament Welsh or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the fight to achieve consensus might result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, from which the project is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the operation of the assembly, such as the rules of inability of the AMs and the design of the system of the committee.
The AMs will get the final vote on how they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonians attend the urns in referendum to change the name of the country
The electors will vote on Sunday the name of their country is changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote will decide to resolve a dispute that already lasts decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long pointed out that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said that he will make case omit of voting.
However, proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, hold that the name change is not more with the price to be paid to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells keep silent while the churches of Harlem continue fighting
The elders told him that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” said Mr Adams.
"Today, not one thing or another."
He said he could understand that bars disappeared.
"Now people socialize in other ways," he said.
«The bars are no longer the rooms of being of the neighborhoods to which the people are usually».
As for the churches, I fear that the money for the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders wait, and “before or after they return where they began”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners full of the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods to remain sanctuaries.
The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” said, “and therefore they will accelerate the closing of all these churches, because it is unlikely that new owners will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were constructed by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved in the 30s.
A nearby black congregation was done with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th street stores, a Harlem commercial street that resisted hiring and ascending to black people.
A fire produced in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as the fregues of the father Johnson made plans to rebuild it, the Carrilón was commissioned.
David Johnson, the son of father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly called the "poor bells".
The expert who played the pardon in July called it otherwise: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also stressed that it was the world’s first coal played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it by the older Carlion of the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one held his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupied St. Martin during the last months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the lay leadership of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the organ that governs the parish and that is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern for the latter to “recover the costs” to the board, although this one had not participated in the contracting of the architects and of the contractors who sent the diocese.
Some locals complained of lack of transparency from the diocese.
A shark hurts a young man while fishing locusts in California
The police reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the season of that crustacean.
The attack occurred shortly before the 7th morning near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel recounted to the KSWB-TV in San Diego taking about half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy helping shouts, when he was born with a group of people to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only emotion for fishing a long, but then realized he was crying “I’ve been working for me!
I’ve been working with me!’
He had the scourge.” Hammel said that he realized when the boy arrived.
"I'll find everyone out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'", it added Hammel.
The boy was shot in helicopter to Rady's children's hospital in San Diego, where he is in a critical state.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rooker, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that had divisioned a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
The officers closed the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablanca, to Swami's, in Ecinites, for 48 hours to undertake a research and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that the majority are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to get into the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's are competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty corridors similar to those of the great warehouses filled with specialists helpers.
As part of the considerable immersion in the UK beauty market, which amounts to 2,800 million pounds and continues to grow while sales in fashion and home products, the biggest brokers with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, and will then go to another year if they are successful.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when supermarkets seek to fill the shelves that in their day occupied TVs, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's declared it would double their offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paww.
Current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with unique areas that can be seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the youngest customer.
In addition, the perfume store, The Fragance Shop, will try concessions in two establishments of Sainsbury’s; the first opened in Croydon, in southern London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small daily food amounts in small stores implies that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, stated that the establishments will increasingly look at shopping centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with discounts shops like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced points of sale in Argos and Habitat in hundreds of shops, as it bought the two chains two years ago, and this strengthened the sales of edibles and yielded the acquisitions.
The earlier attempt of the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's set up a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but association came to an end after a dispute about sharing the income of pharmacies in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sells their pharmacy business formed by 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million £ three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury’s, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff to which you can go to ask for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all the needs and attractive and practical locations means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges ancient shopping habits.
Peter Jones "s furious" after Holly Willoughby retired from business of £11 million
The star of the program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, left “hurious” after Hollywood television presenter Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million business with her life-style brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for her home clothes and accessories brand Truly.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Palrow.
The presenter of This Morning, of 37 years, used Instagram to announce his farewell.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons' Den, Peter Jones throwing sparks on withdrawing his record of lifestyle in the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources indicate that Jones was "s furious" when the gold girl of the television admitted during a tense meeting held on Saturday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, which his new business, valued at 1.5 million pounds, meant that he no longer had time to devote him to the brand of clothes and accessories of both, Truly.
The business came to compare with Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was forecast that it would duplicate the fortune of Willoughby, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, aged 37, he turned to Instagram to announce Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his holiday residents.
One source said, "Truly was by far one of the priorities of Holly.
It was his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave anonymous to all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the release.
There was a store full of goods in the Marlow offices ready to sell”.
The experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning is among the most profitable stars of Britain could cost it to the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from coffins and candles for home clothing and textile, and that it could further delay their launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are three-year-old parents and have a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined as President in March.
The couple went on holiday meetings and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartin as a presenter in the ITV program I'm to Celebrity.
A source close to Jones declared last night that “We should not discuss your business affairs”.
A complicated conversation “and then we fall in love”
He joked with the critiques that he would receive by the means for making a comment that some would consider “little own of a president” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has it given so much President Trump?
Trump said putting his voice of “the television presenter”.
"I didn't give anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in maintaining a second meeting after his initial meeting held in June in Singapore, which Trump considers a great step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation were stagnated.
More than three feet after the peak of June in Singapore, the main diploma in North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, communicated to the world leaders in the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday, which the North does not see the “corresponding response” by the US to the first disarmament measures in North Korea.
In contrast, the U.S. continued to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view in his speech of mitin.
The things with North Korea go well,” he said.
"We go to war with North Korea.
They would have died millions of people.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: he had finished testing with missiles, help him release the hostages, and return home to the remaining US soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about the relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheatre, we would have about 200 peat here", said Trump pointed out to the crowd that he had just ahead.
A symism and a tsunami devastated an island in Indonesian leaving hundreds of dead
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population were displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an essential condition for the international aid.
"Fortunately, in many cases they have left very clear that they will not seek international aid, so it is a challenge," declared Mrs. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Suto, a spokesperson of the national agency for the management of disasters, ensure that employees are considering the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the land tremblings it supports Indonesia, the country is extremely poorly prepared to face the anger of nature.
Although in Aech they built shelters for tsunami, it is not usual to find them on other coasts.
Even though an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to loss of lives.
In the best of the cases, travel between many of the islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been highlighted in Lombok to meet the victims of the earthquake goes to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the place of the new calamity.
The electoral campaign by President Joko Widodo has revolved around the improvement of Indonesia's infrastructure, and has ranked money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds in the final line to the re-election of the next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by the continuous sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority adopted a way of living the most conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the confrontation in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, which use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.

The statue of Cromwell of the parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for “rewrite the history”
His ban would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his fans and puritans.
But the Cromwell Society called the suggestion of Mr. Crick of Disparate and of “try to rewrite the story”.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell located outside Westminster's Palace becomes objective.
The iconoclasty of the English Civil Wars was not ordered or performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would be sacrificed to Cromwell by the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a proof of the current view in the 19th century, and part of a figure that many consider to be worth a tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith declared The Sunday Telegraph: "Crowwell is perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a proponent of the parliament before the external pressure, in this case, was of course the monarchy.
If that is or not a completely complete representation is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict in the mid-17th century defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure that represents a side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also awarded for celebration and commemoration”.
A killer pig scans a Chinese farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in South China.
Last Sunday, South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified only by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and blood-covered near a rabbit in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou.
A pork farmer prepares to put the vaccines to the pigs in a knife on 30 and May 2005 in Xining, in the province of Qinghai, China.
Apparently he had travelled with his cousin on Wednesday since the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open gate that gave another adjacent court.
He said that there was a large male with blood in the mouth.
Forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer until he killed..
My cousin had bloody and snacised legs,” said the cousin, of surname "Wu", to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the safety chamber shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. from Thursday to give him food to their pigs.
His body was found one hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A director of the market told the Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered tests on stage.
It seems that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that attack humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the farm she had in Massachusetts, producing serious harm to man.
Ten years before, a pig of almost 300 kilos would shorten a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he arrived to his wife and scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been devoured by their own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "disparator.
"Only are playing.
They are like children, very curious... they do not intend to harm.
You just have to have them the necessary respect,” he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy and generalized rains to the southwest of the U.S.
The forecasts indicate that the Hurricane Rosa weakens as the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains north of Mexico and southwestern United States for the next few days.
At 5 am on Sunday, east time, Rosa was a Hurricane of category 1 with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north to Sunday.
Meanwhile, a fence begins to take form on the Pacific Ocean and move east, heading to the East Coast of the U.S. as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday and tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture to the north, which will penetrate the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and generalized rains in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, the precipitation between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden flooding, flows of runoff and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The large tropical humidity will cause rainfall that will be close to 50 or 75 l/m2 in peak areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain are expected, especially on much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with conditions in deterioration due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
We discourage adventure in the desert under tropical rain threat.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could become fluctuated rivers, and electric storms will bring locally enclosed and dust winds.
The valley will bring rains locally to strong parts of the southern coast of California.
Total rainfall could have reached more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of smaller runoff and staggered roads.
These would be the first rains of the humid station in the region.
Tropical rains dispersed will begin to approach Arizona in the last hours of Sunday and early Monday, before rain spread at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Rainbound will reach Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will be witness to large temperature oscillations in the US due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes in short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the US center.
There will be a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the alternating plains to parts of the north-east.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates large temperatures above the average for the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial for Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people followed in six television channels the exciting testimonies of the judge appointed to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and of the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that supposedly took place in the 80s.
Meanwhile, political stagnation continues and the chains cut their usual schedule for a new last hour of Friday: an agreement designed by the Senator Arizona, Jeff Flake, to conduct a week investigation of the positions.
Ford told the Senate judicial committee that he is a hundred years old that Kavanaugh performed to him as drunk and tried to take the clothes at a party at the high school.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanagh said he was totally sure that this had not occurred.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen it.
The company had the average audience in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other chains that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems measuring the TV from offices.
To become an idea, it is a audience similar to that of a football final or the Academy Awards ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led the entire chains with an average of 5,69 million viewers during a trial that lasted all day, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second to 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94, MSNBC 2,89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday on television.
After the Republican office had made a statement stating that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was taken over by ANC cameras and CBS on Friday mornings and was adopted by protesters when he attempted to enter a road lift on the Judicial Committee's audience.
He remained with the low look for several minutes as he was rebadged, televised live in CNN.
"I'm here in front of you", he said a woman.
"Do you think that he is telling you the truth to the country?
They said, “you have the power while there are many women defenses.”
Flake said that his office made a Flake statement, before the lift closed, added that he would have to say more in the audience of the committee.
All television and cable broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the appointment of the complete Senate to issue the vote.
But Flake said that he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the next week, something that they urged a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations maintained with his friend, the democratic Senator Chris Cons.
After a conversation with Cones and with several Senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a research by the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The first British Prime Minister accused critics of “play politics” with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, the first Prime Minister Theresa May accused her plans to abandon the European Union to “play politics” with the future of Britain and to harm the national interest.
The first President Theresa May to join the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking May's Chequers plan for the Brexit saying that the proposal that Great Britain and the EU should raise the tariffs on the other side was “totally absurd”.
Wayde Sims killed: the arrest police against Dyteon Simpson as a suspect for Lsu player's death
The police arrested a suspect to take the shots that ended up with the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the Louisiana State University.
According to Baton Rouge police department, Dyteon Simpson, of 20 years, was arrested and imprisoned by a second-degree assassination position.
The officers issued the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims had lost the gaps during the fight.
The police regained the stage gaps and stated that they contained Simpson's DNA, as reported by CBS affiliate WAFB.
After interrogating to Simpson, the police said he admitted to be the author of the shooting he killed Wayde.
The defence reported that 350,000 U.S. dollars were imposed.
The Office of the East Baton Rouge forum issued a preliminary report that indicates that the cause of death is a bullet wound on the head that came to the neck.
The department praised the executive unit of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police laboratory is residents for their assistance to achieve arrest.
Lsu's sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local command forces for his “dligence and search for justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
Their father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for the LSU.
Their average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, the Lsu, Will Wade basketball coach, declared that the team was “backed” and “commonized” by Wayde’s death.
"This is what worries us all the time", declared Wade.
Volcano throws ash on Mexico City
The ashes that threw the popocatept volcano reached the neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised the Saturday to the Mexicans to move away from the volcano after it is detected in the crater and register 183 gas emissions and ashunds within 24 hours.
The center was supervising various bangs and tremblings.
The images of social networks showed fine cinder layers in the neighborhoods of Mexico as Xochimilco.
The geophysical ones detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 kilometres (72 mi) southeast of the capital from an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 mi) to the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Meeting between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesting pro-independence were faced with the anti-distributions police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer vote on the cession of Catalonia.
A group of praepatists masked by the anti-distributions police, guided by eggs and powder paint that created dark dust clouds in the streets that are often crowded of tourists.
There were also spare parts later that day with the police, who used the crawls to contain the fight.
For several hours, leading groups who created “Ni olvido ni pardon”, faced union protesters who shouted “Long Life To Spain”.
Fourty people had to be served by minor injuries received from the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independent region a year after the 1st of October celebrated by the Catalan separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
Votings opted out for independence, although participation was dropped and the opposition to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were wounded last year after the police tried to halt the vote in the election tables throughout the region in violent confrontations.
Proindependent groups camped all the night of Friday to avoid a demonstration of support to the national police.
The demonstration also occurred but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electricist who attended independent demonstrations with his wife, said that he no longer had hope of the possibility of Catalonia to gain independence.
“The past year we live one of our best times.
I saw my parents cry out of joy when I vote, but now we are attacked,” he said.
In spite of a successful victory, although decisive in regional elections in the past December, this year the leading Catalan parties struggled to maintain momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in a self-imposed exile or arrested for their participation in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police demonstration with his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fueled by the policies of both sides.
"Each time there is more stress," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since last year, announced that the following year would be submitted to the elections to the European Parliament.
"present me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffered from the Spanish government," he said.

The goal of Menga gives Livingston victory 1-0 over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for the Livingston has ended in victory
The ascent Livingston surprised the Rangers taking Steven Gerrard to his second 18 games manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt to climb a level by placing after the Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's team still run out of home this year at Premiership and next Sunday confront the leader, Hearts, of which eight points separate them.
But before the Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League the Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues on the division for sixth consecutive game; the main coach, Holt, still does not know how to replace Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston leaves out opportunities against debilitating visitors
The Holt team had to slow down before the time they set out, as with their control they caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way, but his shooting crossed not through the lottery threshold; then, Alan Lithgow's shot was out driven by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team was formed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could jeopardize visitors on the right-hand games.
And so it was how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers awarded a free shot and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined their efforts to fix Menga, who touched the ball and set from the center of the arena.
At that time, the Rangers dominated possession but faced an impenetrable defence that avoided him very much work on the Lime Kelly's guard.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop of Kelly.
The Rangers' guards, Allan McGregor stopped with the feet a shot by Scott Pittman, and Litgow ordered the ball out on another move at Livingston's left ball.
A number of passages were recorded in the Livingston area that were continually cleared, while two petitions were rejected: one by hand and another by a Halkett entrance to the replacement Glenn Middleton.
'Fenonal' by Livingston: analysis
Alessandro Lamont for BBC Scotland from the Tony Macaroni Stadium
An action and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
́And unanimous, they have been excellent and continue to surpass the expectations in their upward trajectory.
His style of play and players soon changed since he had returned to the top category, but part of the merit is Holt for the way he promoted the team from his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, successfully led a perfectly organized defence while Menga gave no respite in the whole game Connor Goldson and Joe Worall.
At the Rangers he lacked inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under the order of Gerrard, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass; they only managed to penetrate the host team once. All an advance call for the Rangers, which is in half of the table.
Erdogan receives an ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany to breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, which aims to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have distended over many matters, including human rights, freedom of press and access from Turkey to the EU.
Then, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city hosts the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan approached him to see his president.
Hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan policies and the decision of the German government to receive him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the previously admired division as a hero by some Germans and critics as autocratic for others.

The Hurricane Rosa threatened Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare that a tropical depression affects Arizona, but it is very likely that it occurs at the beginning of the next week, when the energy of the Hurricane Rosa crosses the South West Desert leaving possibility of flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flooding alerts to the south and east of Nevada, southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly on Phoenix on Tuesday and the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix's National Meteorological Service has indicated that only ten tropical cyclones maintain the state of depression or tropical storm in a radius of 320 kilometers from 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane that extended into a 64 km radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service come from 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with amounts isolated from up to 150l/m2 in the Bogotá Quarter of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could reach 25 or 50 litres, with total area being total than 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, since the region is very affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the South West is experiencing droughts.
According to the US Dry Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category,” reported weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa will touch land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still will have hurricane force on Sunday morning, with a maximum of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north to 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected that touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday night.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, with an important risk of flooding.
Total rainfall is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and can be found up to 250 l/m2, weather.com.
Then, Rosa will drive north into Mexico in the form of tropical storm before arriving to the border of Arizona at first hour on Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continue crossing Arizona and enter south of Utah the last night of Tuesday.
"The main danger of Rosa or of what is left of him are the strong precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and in the southwest of the U.S. Desert", communicated the National Center of Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause sudden water storms and runoff flows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.

Trump affirms that Kavanaugh ‘suffered the meskind and cholera’ of the Democratic Party
"Volt for the judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the ruthless and scandal tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered the mesquinty and the cholera" of the Democratic Party throughout its naming process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, where he denied the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually grown decades ago, being teenagers.
Ford also testified in the trial about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday the “ Americans” were witnessing the brilliance, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm the Kazaugh judge is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our times with a public service history impoute,” he said addressing the crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president was informed of the appointment of Kavadaugh as he spoke of the importance of the republican results in the half-hand elections.
"Faltan five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I do not compete, but really yes that I do it,” he said.
"For this I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is “opposing and hindering”.
It is expected that the first procession vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavadanugh takes place before Friday, as reported by CNN an assistant to the Republican Party.
The symism and tsunami of Indonesia causes hundreds of dead and the number continues to grow
The authorities reported that at least 384 people died, many of them dragged on giant waves that broke into the beaches, when a great earthquake and a tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on land to the mollusk, getting the life of many and destroying everything in its passage.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately, so they were deceased,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman of the management agency of Indonesia BNPB disasters in a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, dragged cars, trunks, house, ravaged everything he found,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had gone to a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people rose to trees to escape from the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs spread by the national agency for the management of disasters showed many destroyed shops and buildings, turrets and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian agency for the assessment and application of technology (BPT) declared that the energy released by the enormous sym of the Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay, was able to magnify the size of the tsunami, stated.
Nugroh described the damages as “quantitious” and said that thousands of houses, commercial hospitals, and hotels came down below.
The bodies of some victims were trapped under the drafts, declared, adding that 540 were wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that victims and damages could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Dongala and that is closer to the epicenter of sistem.
The communications have been “allly paralyzed and there is no information” of Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” reported the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on the way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was hardly criticized on Saturday because he had not informed the arrival of a tsunami to Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared recording of the social networks, one can listen to a man who is on the last floor of a building shouts frequently warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people who were on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water collides with the sea leading through buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The symism and tsunami caused an important payment that caused the court of communications across Palu, hindering the coordination of rescue tasks.
The authorities state that the army began to send cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuation continues to urgently require food and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been re-opened but it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The ranking of victims of the Indonesia tsunami exceeds the number of 800.
It is terrible.
During the road that ran World Vision staff to get to the city of Palu, where employees are kept in shelters of canvas raised in the courtyard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, commented Mr. Doseba.
They said that they saw a lot of destroyed house,” he said.
It is terrible.
Even when the groups began the unfortunate task of running assistance in case of catastrophe, some were complained that they were preventing him from travelling to Palu to foreign humanitarian workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supply and staff from abroad can only flow if the place of quality is declared a national catastrophic zone.
And this has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of a province", he said Alia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says “How long, this is a national disaster”, we will be able to open to international aid, but it has not yet come that moment”.
By falling the second night in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, relatives and friends of the missing people were waiting to be one of the miracles that lightened the deprimente argument of natural disasters.”
On Saturday they took the child out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been wearing two days under her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian team of paragliding, will train two of the parapeters missing for the Asian Games, which concluded early in this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi added that some of the people caught in the Roa Hotel were his pupils.
As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the diffusion of the news of the overthrow of the Roa hotel between the parapentist community, he had repeatedly tried to send messages from WhatsApp to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival
However, only a gray mark has been shown instead of two blue brands.
I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he added.

The Kanye West rapper changes the name of Ye
The Kanye West rapper changes the name of Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The former being known as Kaye West”.
For some time ago that West, from 41 years old, is known as the nickname of Ye, which used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to release their new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which cancelled his attendance for "emotional reasons", according to the developer of the program.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had already explained above that the word had a religious meaning for him.
I think that ‘ye’ is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, that same year he had said about his album as Big Boy radio presenter.
So I'm you, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the only one, only Ye, which is a reflection of the kind that there are in us, of evil, of confusion, of all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed the name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year announced they prefer to call Love and Brother Love.
An old West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also committed to putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMLO undertakes not to use military against civilians
The elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obradoiro, pledged not to use the military force against civilians when he approached the 50th anniversary of a bloody uprising against the students.
López Obradoiro promised on Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that “will not use the military to repress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, the troops fired on a peaceful demonstration at the square killing about 300 people at a time when the student movements were razed throughout Latin America.
López Obradoiro has promised to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to young people who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag to the guys to criminal bands.
USA should double investment in I.A.
According to the investors and IT professional Kai-Fu Lee, used by Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount invested in AI in view of the growing activity of China in the field.
Comments took place after several parts of the U.S. government had made announcements about AI, even if the U.S. lack a formal strategy about AI.
Meanwhile, China presented its previous year plan: it aims to be the number 1 in innovation in AI in 2030.
“Dumpling the research budget in AI would be a good start, since the other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next great advancement in AI”, said Lee.
Duplicating funding could double the probabilities that the following achievement in the matter of AI was made in the U.S., he said Lee to the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World, was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is a general director of Sinnovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent Chinese companies: Face++.
In the 80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the American Othello player with the highest score and, later, he was Executive at Microsoft Research from the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Robotic Challenge of Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work a lot to get government scholarships, declare Lee.
"China is not who is leading academic leaders, but companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired university geniuss to work on AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. to boost its efforts in AI.
I think they should offer residence cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The China State Council published its New-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of china provides funding for people of academic institutions as well as the National Foundation of Science and other governmental organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, stated Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has established an artificial intelligence center which is intended to include members of the industry and the university, and the White House announced the formation of the artificial information selective committee.
And this month, the DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in research in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that has sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded for months.
The Macedonians vote in referendum if they change the name of the country.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their name the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece and to block requests for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and EU.
The governments of the two countries came to an agreement in June on the new proposed name, but the nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result will reach 50 percent minimum necessary for the valid referendum.
The question that was in the role of the referendum was: "It is in favor of the accession to NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The proponents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying in entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the emergent countries in the fall of Yugoslavia.
Today I have seen voting for the future of Macedonia, so that they can freely live under the protection of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, of 79 years, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many members of the parliament said that they would end the vote and that it would be final.
The change of nine would need a majority of two thirds of the parliament.
The state commission of elections stated that no irregularity was recorded at 1 p. m.
However, participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters dismissed their vote.
I have been voting for my children, our site is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevsky, a voter of 62 years from the capital, Skopje.
The first Macedonian minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deposited his vote for the referendum on the change of the country that would open the way to his accession to the European Union in Stumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavarkov, of 54 years, prepared a small stage and placed houses in front of the stalls for those who had boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with the high head and not on the service door, added Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you do not accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union”.
The Prime Minister Zaev claims that membership of NATO will bring the investment so necessary to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate greater than 20 percent.
I think that the vast majority will be in favor of more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the entry into the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after depositing his vote.
He said that a positive result would be the “ confirmation of our future”.
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of the vote would take part in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said it would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid the result you have to be 50 per cent more than one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major coup for the politics of the West government since he had access to power in May of the past.
See: Sergio Aguero, Player of Manchester City, crosses all the defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling accounted for Brighton's defense with 2-0 of Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem dynamically simple to mark the goal of the minute 65.
The Argentine striker received a walk in the mid-field at the start of the sequence.
He raced in three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He was challenged by a defence before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He then passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English front used the first to bounce the ball back to Aguero, which hit the Brighton Mathew Ryan's guard with a shot to the right of the network.
"Aguero is crossing some problems in the pe", said the coach of the City, Pep Guardiola, to the reporters.
We talk to have played 55 or 60 minutes.
And there was when it happened.
We were lucky enough to score at that time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the bluestones the initial advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the minute 29.
Aguero received the ball in the depth of the field of Brighton in that move.
He sent a beautiful walk into the gap on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several touches before taking Sterling to the opposite pole.
The blue people got the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
The City will face the Hoffmann in the Champions League group on Tuesdays at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhine-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to rent the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals outside of the fight for elimination, there were not many reasons to force another ownership.
But a competitive Scherzer hopes to launch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the removal of the Rockies, which carry an advantage game for Los Angeles Dodgers in the western division of the national league.
The Rockets secured at least one position in the wild with the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still try to close their first division title.
"Although we don’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would be likely to play at the highest level this year.
Why will not I want to compete in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced that it will be the opener on Sunday, but it seems to be included that Scherzer is what she throws in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom he would be his first number 34, made another Bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch on Sunday on his usual day of rest.
Washington's disaster is 5-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikers in 220–23 entries this season.
Trump Celebrates a mitin in West Virginia
The president spoke indirectly to the situation surrounding the chosen by the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the result in the half-mand elections.
"We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks for one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is something great, great... I do not compete, but really yes that I do it and that's why I'm going on all sides fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued to say, “I already see this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what is happening now.
And they are determined to recover the power using any necessary means, evil, and meskind.
They don’t care who hurts, over whom they have to pass to achieve power and control, that's what they want, power, and control and we'll never give it.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and hinder."
«And they have seen this last four days,” he said, qualifying the democrats of “outsided, fenced, disgusting and liars”.
He numbered the Senate judicial committee to cite Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public support.
"Remember your answer?
Filter the document?
mmm.jem, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... It was the worst body language, the worst I have seen."
The Labour Party is no longer as open.
It is not tolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I did not really surprised me.
after all, they are the last of a series of laborers that we are not well received, and everything by saying our opinion.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because he was committed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship I was criticised by not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn
on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and over Europe, casually topics about which Jeremy dissent with the previous leaders.
The notification for the business meeting at Nottingham East on Friday indicated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
For most of the eight years that he took as a laborist deputy, the meetings of the Friday evenings of the committee were exactly so.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more kind and brilliant” policy has forgotten long ago, if it is that it ever began.
Each time it is more evident than the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This soon began after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when he began to share a similar political vision, began to wait for me to portray and take on positions with which he would never agree, be in national security as the only EU market.
When he spoke publicly, and in fact a little like that he says, there is a tremendous abortion and attacks on social networks censored the school policy, I told him that he should not be in the Labour Party.
And it does not happen to me only.
In fact, I know that they are more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed my are usually political in nature.
I print the professionalism and determination of the colleagues facing a sexist or racist comment torrent every day and that I do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each movement of “non-confidence” or each change in the rules of selection, the game becomes narrower of looks.
During the last few years I received many tips that urge me to keep my head hidden, not to be so frank and that then “ever would go well for me”.
But I did not put me in politics to do that.
Since I have joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, driven by the negligence of the government of Thatcher who had literally left my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them the most, both being local minister.
I have never heard my policy, not even in the last choice.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political stances and in which I do not agree with the current direction of the party.
Those who promoted the movement of Friday, the only thing that would say is that while the country walks towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, companies and public services, I do not understand that desire to lose time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electors, whether they are members or not of the party: I am proud of services and promise that no political threat or convenience will hesitate to act in accordance with what I consider the best interests of all you.
Chris Leslie is deputy by Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an Ayr guest set head
It is possible that the last two attempts have changed the final result a little, but it does not fit any doubt that the Ayr deserve to win this single game of the Premier League of Tenten.
Now lead the table and is the only guest team of ten.
He was eventually the superior of his defence, as well as the fact of risk, led the team to victory, and the coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
«Therefore now they have tested us our game and follow invites, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said, "You need to recognize that the Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than others."
The test in the minute 14 of Grant Anderson, transformed by Frazier Climo, put ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot topped a failed release.
Climo raised the advantage to the Ayr with a penalty, before, just in half time, turned a solo shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr in the rest.
But Melrose started well the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop by the serious injury that had suffered Ruaridh Knott, who left the field in patrol and, from restarting, Ayr advanced further through a test of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Clymo.
The captain in the role of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having a player more than a Bruce Colvine essay was not consumed, at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for proclaiming Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson marked an essay from the penalty line at the back of the May of Ayr.
Climo marked, as he did almost since the rebooting, after Kyle Rowe had collected the launch in the area of David Armstrong and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to obtain the fifth rehearsal of the local team.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears to be prepared to enter the catering industry after it was named director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis played in the popular BBC series, which he wrote and co-starred with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the final, and it seems that Kerman plans another life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, it is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make comments, although a source of the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in the “prose business of Glasgow’s restaurants”.
'The sea is our': the inner Bolivia expects the court to the Pacific
The sailors watch a naval base covered with devices in La Paz.
The public buildings where there is a flag of blue color.
Naval bases from Lake Tica to Amazon are linked to the slogan: "The sea is our right.
Retrieve it is a duty."
In the sealess Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast before Chile in a bloody 19th century conflict continues alive, just like the longing of returning to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at its peak in decades, as Bolivia expects a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the necessary impulse, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many bolivians will see the CIX sentences in giant screens throughout the country with the hope that the Hague Court is pronounced in favor of Bolivia and, after decades of intermittent conversations, Chile is obliged to negotiate the concession to Bolivia from a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the cartoonist native Bolivian president, who faces a battle controversy for the reelection next year, also has a lot in the game in the sentence on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", it promised in late August.
But some analysts consider little likely that the court gives you the reason to Bolivia, and that would soon change if that happened.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands does not have the power to award Chilean territory, and stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the judgment of the CIX comes only six months after the final appendices that we heard indicates that the case “was not complicated”, says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could be late.
The topic of access to the sea takes a long time blocked by the current bolivian administration,” states Zárate.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales undermined the good will that he left Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume conversations at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after that.
The two countries have been trading ambassadors since 1962.
The president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been taking an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile”, and an opportunity to “at last 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this topic for political purposes.
Bolivia will never give up to your right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to surpass the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not be produced unless it can be trusted in the U.S.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong, declares that his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if he can not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill promises made during a summit in Singapore among his leaders.
This comment takes place at a time when the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, appears to be at the point of restarting nuclear diplomacy stagnant for more than three decades after the top with the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong One.
Ri affirms that it is “a utopia” that the continuous sanctions and objections of the United States to a statement that put an end to the Korean War manages to fold to the North.
In Washington, the declaration is resisted without Pyongyang from the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is the widespread skepticism that Pyongyang speaks seriously in terms of giving up an arsenal that the country is likely to see how the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeus plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit Kim-Trump.
Paris fashion parades reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or be covered completely from the sun, do not look for more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in the walkway a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that opened the public with the purest style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers pulled their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated, ornate hat with a wide range imitating feathers that inundated the heads of models.
Among other large accessories there were praised watermelons, a mage hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head of the cold.
Thomas Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... right in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks had the lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seam.
One of the creations seemed a complete diving team, with the fat and the tube, and others a melted ice cone.
And if you're doing the fashion of the huge, you're lucky.
The fashion understood predicted that giants could reach the shops.
Unprovided hats come just after the “Bomba”, the straw hat with a range of 60 cm that takes the whole world from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks pulled out to the walkway another great creation: a beach bag almost as large as the model beaded with a bath suit that takes it.
The orange rat bag adorned with rifa flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the prominent piece of the summer spring 2019 collection of Jacquesmus' La Riviera in the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous style Luke Armitage declared the FEMAIL: 'I hope that the hats and big beach bags reach the next summer, since the designer had such a great impact that would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories'.
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the citizens of the world
Private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding results in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community matters.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of private schools (SCIS for their acronym in English), strive to offer the best level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customised study plan, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak a man in a language you understand, that's coming to the head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, you will come to the heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot only depend on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of recent examinations this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages have obtained an outstanding one.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that make up the SIS, show that 72% of the students obtained honorary registration in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding one.
This shows that private schools support languages and consider key skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Currently, languages are considering the same subjects as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private schools and all kinds.
A poll made by the UK employment and training Commission in 2014, indicated that among the lack of language knowledge constitutes 17% of the reasons why entrepreneurs cost them to cover vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they learn a second language they will have a real advantage in the future with a living skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly to the head of the competition.
According to a YOUGov poll between over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to keep a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a percentage of two digits, in this case 15%.
That is why it is so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with the most opportunities to find significant employment.
In Scotland, teaching languages differ according to school.
Some schools focus on the most classic modern languages, while others focus on languages considered more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of their children’s interests, private schools have several languages to choose from and teachers in this field.
Private schools are specialized in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the necessary skills to succeed, whatever the future is.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages are still of vital importance to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “International communicative skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of private schools.
Lebron debuted with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait has almost finished for the fans who wish to watch LeBron James playing for the first time with Los Angeles Lakers.
Team coach Like Walton announced that James will play the initial game of the season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But still remains to decide how many minutes will play.
It will be more than 1 and less than 48,” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell published on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the training of early weeks, they asked James for their plans the pre-season of six games of the Lakers.
At these heights of my career I do not need preseason matches to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s electoral acts come to Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign minutes tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump’s 5 mini-programmes for the next week, including the stops in cities related to him as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of a break for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court's vacant vote, Trump aims to gain support for the next half-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump’s mittin in West Virginia and how can you watch it on the Internet?
The Trump mitin in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s mitin in West Virginia to continue by live broadcast by YouTube.
Trump will likely treat the topic of the judgment held this week to the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense for inappropriate sexual conduct accusations and keeps in mind the vote of confirmation of the Senate for a week while the FBI researches.
But the main objective of this series of mints is to help the Republicans to face the elections of November with a new boost.
Therefore, these five minits that Trump will give the next week aim to “invigorate volunteers and supporters while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, according to Reuters.
"Congression control is so important for your agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible to the campaign season", said to Reuters a spokesperson of Trump’s campaign that preferred not to be named.
The mitin of this night, which will be held in the West Bank, could gather supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visit West Virginia, the state in which he won for more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of West Virginia to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
"It is not a good symptom of Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a polithologist from the University of West Virginia to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows you aguante to fight and keep hope alive until the Sunday's individual matches
After three individual sessions, the foursome on Saturday afternoon could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The oscillating pendulum of impulse is a sporty concept entirely invented but in which athletes believe indeed, and especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say that you're driving now?
"I had an advantage of six points and now are four, so I suppose that we took it as a bit of impulse", Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with sweeter in play.
The Americans, Spieth, felt they have a bit of wind in favor and a lot of so they cheered, among other things the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day and each account with three points of four.
Spieth turned out to be a literal from the tee to the green and is preaching with the example.
These gut screams became stronger as the round was advancing, making a crucial putt to draw the fourth game when it and Thomas were two points below two.
Upon getting the putt that made them win the match in 15, he put a similar cry, the kind of scream that he says he thinks the American team is not yet out.
"You just have to concentrate and worry about your game", he said Spieth.
It's the only one left now to these players.
18 holes to leave footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four and cannot get wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon and not last nine holes on Friday morning.
This route, and the way in which it seems to flow its energy towards the crowd and from her, the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a victory when he put the sun on Le Golf National that Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably the two at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio García, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he joined with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first tour ended with the Spanish and Swedish in a hole where they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday there will be no one to help him get out of the hole.
Four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely about the interactions between couples, the advices that are given, those not and the way in which you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursomes session also proved that Team USA has a thing to fight, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes an advantage of 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourballs and foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 on the US.
The inspiring duet by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to climb four points to the recorder in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which seeks to preserve the trophy that lost two years in Hazeltine, dominated by an American team that failed in the 4 female men's four-balls, putting the 3-1 series.
U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but failed to cut the advantage.
The Jim Furyk team needed eight of the 12 individual games of the Sunday to preserve the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the top four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed on the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a slump and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more 5&4 category.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bragies of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in the modalities of fourballs and foursomes and five consecutive.
Justin Rose, who had rested on the fourballs in the morning, returned with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, numbers one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win in a pleasant day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas championed the point of reference to the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter at the 4balls and returned to power and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two times in the story of the Ryder Cup in which a team goes back four points in the individual, although as the current holder of the trophy, the Furyk team just needs to start to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of its reach.
North Coast says not to unifying disarmament if there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea reported on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions increased their distrust in the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho communicated to the General Assembly that Korea had adopted “important measures to show its good will” last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missiles, dismantling nuclear testing fields and compromising to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
However, we do not see the corresponding answer from the US,” he added.
" Without trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no universal disarmament first for our part."
While Ri was returning to the well-known North American complains about Washington's resistance to a "gradual denuclearisation" by which North Korea would be recognized as it adopted measures, its declaration seemed important, as it did not reject unilaterally denuclearisation as it had occurred with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri has made reference to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the top between an active US president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim has committed itself to “denuclearisation” of the Korean Peninsula while Trump guarantees the security of North Korea.
North Korea has long sought a formal end for the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared the first Pyongyang to depos its nuclear weapons.
Washington also claimed to relax the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
U.S. insists on “first denuclearisation” and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their cooperative goal of the war-making, and even opposes the “final declaration” said Ri.
«The perception that the sanctions can make us knee is a impossible dream, for whom we do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuous sanctions adhere to our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second top between Kim and Trump who the American leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the US, denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after the "bad President" Trump calls Kim "puet man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “toth” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action to disarmament, but said that he still has a lot of work to do and that the sanctions should remain until North Korea denounced.
Wednesday Trump said there was no deadline for this, and “of the same thing it takes two years, three or five months”.
China and Russia discuss if the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for adopted measures.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that: “The fulfilment of the sanctions of the Security Council must remain firmly and without exception until we observe the total, final and verified denucleation”.
The Safety Council has increased the sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeus met with Ri at the margin of the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeus visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not come well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that it had been advanced, only a few hours since North Korea complained to him for doing “mafiose demands”.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile impeachment, as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States adopted the “corresponding measures”.
He noted that Kim had said that the "corresponding measures" that he wanted were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and the advance towards the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students perform a course on how to rest enough
This year, a new course of Harvard University is doing that all his students last longer in order to combat the growth of male culture of studying the whole night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic discovered that the students of the university number one of the world often know the basic aspects of how to take care of them.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard School of Medicine and specialist in the Brigham Hospital and of Women, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to begin the course after giving a talk about the impact that the lack of sleep had on learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, 'Why only tell me this now, in my last year?'
He said that no one had spoken about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," said to The Telegraph.
The course, which has been launched this year for the first time, explains the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving general well.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry of the Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the health services of the university, said that the university decided to submit the course after learning that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course of a duration involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to get information about caffeine and light effects and how the sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine in bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how the lack of prolonged sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, brain injury, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
"We know that the student’s behaviour will not be changed immediately.
But we believe that you have the right to know this information, in the same way that we have the right to know what effects are for health if we opted for smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of spending the whole night still exists, says, and adds that the modern technology and the increasingly greater pressure for the students who involved lack of sleep was an increasing problem.
Ensure that you sleep enough and that you have a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, tiredness and anxiety, it points out, even avoiding weighting, since the lack of sleep causes the brain to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to drive a course across the campus.
The next step, wait, is to apply for all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider the option of establishing an alarm to lie down, as well as for when they wake up, it is also advisable that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit electronic screens and LED lighting, which can unbalance the circadian rhythm and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: the goal of Menga to knock down the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when the attack of Dolly Menga relegated Steven Gerrard's disarrayed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The team wanted to record their first home victory for 4-1 in February at St. Johnstone, but the team at Gary Holt caused the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 games as manager, who left his team eight points from the Hearts, Lakers Premiership leaders, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that he was tied.
While the rangers rose to sixth place, the Livingston climbs to the third place and is only behind Hibernian with a different goal.
And he could have been much worse for the Rangers after the line judge Calum Spencer had to deal with a wound in the head after the launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team he pulled off the Ayr at the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11th of the Livingston that took a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his joint organized suffocated his opponents at all times.
It is possible that the Rangers dominated possession, but the Livingston made much more when they had the ball.
They could have marked in just two minutes when the short pass of the first time of Menga sent Scott Pittman to the gallery of Allan McGregor, but the wasteer this great opportunity.
A powerful free shot by Keaghan Jacobs came to Captain Craig Halket, but his teammate, Alan Lithgow, only managed to dig him into the second stick.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they were more hopeful than convincing their game in the offensive arena.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt that he would have penalized at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the claims of the Colombian.
The Rangers only made two shots to the door in the first half, but the old Ironx Guard, Liam Kelly, had barely problems with the head finish of Lassana Coulily and the attack of Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening of the Livingston in the minute 34 could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that it deserved for his hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who maintained the cold blood to choose the Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the rest by changing Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, a change that had almost an immediate effect when the sway made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston devoured visitors to exactly the kind of game you like, with Lithgow and Halket collecting a long ball after another.
The Holt team could have expanded the advantage at the final moments, but McGregor was perfectly raised to reject Jacobs before Lithgow was overturned.
The replacement of the Rangers, Glenn Middleton, claimed another penalty when he was plotted with Jacobs, but Thomson once again made the stand fat.
Storage: The inventor of the Keeper
And now a page of our store of the "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 13th years ago, and CONTACT... it was the day when the future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
A science pillar since then, the publisher Geiger has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" ("Bells of Coronado"), starring those cartoonists seemingly unusual Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is it in the world?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counterman, which is used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
By placing these headphones, the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals can be heard.
Evans: "I say, sure you're slaying now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days after his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears its name survive.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the lab
They can "see" a common protein for various types of cancer and re-injected it
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the defective cells, has shown to disappear their ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States Cancer Institute, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine"
HERC2 "improves the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the removal of immune cells from patients and " teaching them" to address cancer cells worked on the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kaneye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump on using an MAMA badge (Make America Great Again) after its appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good
During a Saturday Night Live show, they pitched Kaye West in the studio after a confusing presentation that he praised U.S. president Donald Trump, and said it would be presented as a candidate in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he took a cap by Make America Great Again, he criticised the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"It often talks to a white one and says, "How can you like Trump if it is racist?"
If he was worried about racism, he would have left the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a satire by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanagh to the U.S. Senate's Judicial Committee about sexual aggression by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not issued, Chris Rock rose to the critical images of West to social networks.
It is unclear whether Rock attempted to mock West with this post.
West complained to the audience that he had a bad time in the frames due to his cap.
"I've gone with me in the frames.
They said, “do not leave with that hat”.
I have intimidated me!
And then they said he was going to sink the pick," said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how I'm going to catch me?", saying that it would be "to use my superhome cap, because you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to advance?
Try with love."
His comments have led to a number of papers in the audience at least twice, and the members of the SNL cast appeared to have been embarrassed, reported to the Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave to the publication: "All the studio was silently at all times."
They had been nominated for West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose old youth, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people with an interpretation of I love it ("Emo it"), dressed as a bottle of water Perrier.
West obtained the support of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: thank you for making fit into the MAFI"
However, the presenter of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying that West was simply "to be who is and that's completely wonderful".
However, I chose not to reward anyone (buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I think is embracing and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
Like us,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now it was "the being officially known as Kaye West".
It is not the first artist to change his name; it follows the steps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist previously known as Prince.

The Star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role in handling sword as Jon Snow in the legendary fantasy series of HBO Game of Thrones.
The actor, of 31 years, attacked the stereotype of male hero, saying that those roles on the screen seem that young people often have to be hard for them to respect them.

What do we teach men when they grow, in terms of the problem we see now?”
Kit believes television can be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
Did he continue: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel that they have to be a certain part of being a man?
I think it really is one of the great questions of our time; how do we change that?
Because, clearly, something went wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series reaches its next summer, stating that "just from horses and battlefields".
From November, Kit will play a reposition of True West (The true west), by Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.

Rose played Ygritte, the character's love of Kit, Jon Snow, in the Emmy winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie’s family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase in 14% in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, declared health authorities.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have been sexually transmitted, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV propagated rapidly by some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people who had contracted HIV in this way had nearly zero reduced, have affirmed Chinese health authorities in a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, in international terms, the number of people living with HIV or with AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
homosexuality was declined in China in 1997, but it ensures that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to mediation for HIV as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters desmented that a member of the staff leaks data from the Senators of the Republican Party, "pigious lies" and "conspired theories"
On Saturday, US representative, Maxine Waters, reported the allegations that a member of their staff had published personal information from three Senators on the US Republican Party's pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic Democrat said that the declarations were being made by websites and drafts of the "outright".
"Mentures, lies and more infamous lies" commented Waters in a statement on Twitter.
According to it, the spread information included the particular addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in the Capitol Hill, the headquarters of the United States government, during a hearing by the Senate panel about inadequate sexual conduct accusations against the candidate Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The filtration appeared shortly after the three Senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Prominent sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters department and revealed the information of a member of the Waters staff, communicated the Capitol Hill.
"This infused accusation is totally false and a complete lie", he continued Waters.
«The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, has not been responsible in any way for the filtration of this information.
This infused accusation is totally false and a complete lie."
The Declaration of Waters followed ended up by critics online, including those of the former Secretary of Press of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This dismay was done with anger", he wrote Fleischer.
It gives to understand that he does not have time to be a member of the Congress.
When they accuse someone of something that has not done, it should not become angry.
It should not be shown challenging.
You should not question the reasons for the account holder.
It must remain peaceful and with serenity."
It seemed that Fleischer was compareing to the reaction of Waters criticizing the demonstrations of the Judgment Kavanaugh, to which critics accused him of being too angry during the youth's audience.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who submitted to break Waters in extreme extreme extremes, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"very strong if it were true" shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities responsible for compliance with the law and the appropriate authorities of these fraudulent accusations.
We will make sure to discover the guilty", he continued, "as well as to be legally responsible for all of his actions which are destroyed and dangerous for each and every one of my members".
Critic by Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Again in action), Rowan Atkinson's no-power spy parody
It is already traditional to look for the trend of the Brexit in young films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the Johnny English franchise of this parody and action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire about the matter of the evident stupid thing that we are in the new opportunity of export of the nation?
Anyway, the incompetent character of the jumps and rubber face of Johnny English has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time; his name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English children.
Naturally, it is the pretentious secret agent who, despite his stipends of adult glamorousness, has a bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean and a piece of this type that contributed a single note in the opening ceremony of the London Olympiads 2012.
It is also originally based on the international cosmopolitan and mysterious agent that Atkinson played once on the forgotten Hollywood TV shows, in which he sow chaos to his passage.
There are a couple of good moments on Johnny English’s last departure.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while using a medieval armor suit and the steps of the rotor do a brief bang against his helmet.
The owner of Atkinson for the physical comedy jumps to sight, but it gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when this type of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use the comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It looks like if the mood was aimed at children, rather than adults, and in my opinion the extravagant adventures of Johnny English are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson's silent film jokes when dealing with the character of Bean.
Now the topical argument is that Great Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirate is inflated in the network of supersecret web spies of Britain and reveals the identities of all the British agents in the area, for distressing the agent who is in service, a misfortune small paper for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the colum for a prime minister pompous and conflicting, who already suffers a total crisis of political impurity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this character that almost Teresa May, but it can not be done very much with the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that as all the spies engaged in active, you must take someone out of the retreat.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher in some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes about how to become an infected agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy at a school of rock.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency informationive session and meet with their former partner and suffered by Bough, performed again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin of the wrongs of the secret service of His Majesty returns to the action, playing with the beautiful fatal femme of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the first minister is to dangerously succumb to the charm of the technological characterization that may solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odysse of ridiculous fractures: disguised as a waitress, lit fire to a mysterious French restaurant; they create a tumult that makes them illegally aboard the luxury yachts of Volta; and English causes the total anarchy while trying to use virtual reality helmets to reconcile with the interior of the house of Volta.
Evidently, all detentions come out of this last sequence, but in the kindly and scandalous way that it is, it seems to be taken out of a child television program.
The result is quite regular.
And, how did it happen to other films by Johnny English, could I avoid thinking: the British film industry cannot offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but cover five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but that cover five
As a matter, the party wants entrepreneurs to pass the savings obtained through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers to give them an additional free day.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would continue to receive the same salary.
Sources say that the idea would "adjust" to the economic agenda of the game and its plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Directors supported the four days a week as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a review of policies before the end of the year.
"Do not happen the day at night, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits the focus of the party to balance the worker's economy, as well as the overall strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not currently support ambition in its entirety.
A Labour Party spokesperson said, "A four-day working week does not enter the party policy and is not being considered by it."
The chancer in the shadow, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr.McDonnell said that he was determined to recover the power of the "anonymous directors" and the "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of chancellor in the shade also involve the possibility that current shareholders of water companies do not recover all their investment, as a laborist government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans to place workers in the councils of the companies and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the shares of the private sector to employees, who issue annual dividends for a value of up to €500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the investigation of the FBI about Kavanaugh could make them change opinion
The investigation of the FBI against the accusations against the judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, and the question was presented about whether the discoveries of the department could influence the Republicans' support.
On Sunday, on the issue of an interview, the reporter of the "60 Minutes" Scott Pelley asked Republicanists John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could take them to change opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I said I would go to the audience. I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
Call him after the accusation came out and asked him if he was done.
It was firm, determined, resounding."
However, Graham's vote seems to be unattainable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanagh is determined and would do an explosive accusation," he said.
Dr. Ford, I do not know what happened; but I know the following: Brett refused," he added Graham in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people who mentioned could not verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I do not see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive cartel of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission, ending with world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people to go to the Great Lawn sand of the Central Park, not only to enjoy actions such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to create awareness of the actual objective of the event to end poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project (Global Project against Poverty), a group of international support that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively combating it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, calling or any other significant way to help create awareness about your goal of ending up with poverty.
But what is the degree of success of the Global Citizen to 12 years of achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free show is a genuine way to persuade people to seek measures or is only another case of the so-called “clicivism”, people who thinks that they make the difference when signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, driving a set of different objectives.
He stated that these actions helped stimulate the world leaders to announce compromises and policies equivalent to more than 37 million $ established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from their actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been repaid or raised.
The group estimates that up to now guaranteed funds had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), a company of investors and U.S. executors committed to "help children to develop up to their maximum potential", with the promise of providing Rwanda 35 million $ to help finish denutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and supporters of Global Citizen as you, we can convert social denutrition into a note at the foot of the story,” said to the crowd the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in favour of improving nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with interventions on nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, "what makes you think we can end the extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult path, and sometimes we will fall down and we will fail.
But, as has happened with the big anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year's events in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furs and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to make a "lock" to make Russia's energy exports difficult, announced the U.S. Secretary of Interior.
Washington may resort to the Navy to prevent the Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the U.S. Secretary of Interior, Ryan Zineke, as he cited Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates the instances of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade with the energy as they did in Eastern Europe," said, as reported.
In addition, according to the official, they have the forms and means to face it.
The United States has the capacity, along with the navy, to ensure that the sea roads are open and, if necessary, locking to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke aimed at participants in the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is called itself the "fly of the energy consumer" in the US.
He compared Washington strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that, in practice, it is the same.
The economic option in Iran and Russia consists more or less, in taking advantage of and replacing fuels," he commented, while referring to Russia, "just having a tactic" with an economy dependent on hydrocarbons.
Statements were made while the administration of Trump was on a mission to promote exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, including the president, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 oil project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into "cative" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of 11 million $, which was established to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 million cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that the fervent opposition of Washington to the project is only argued by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
I think that we share the idea that energy can not be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers must choose the suppliers,” said the Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. posture obtained the reaction of Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German organization of the sector, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), appealed to the United States to move away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a great problem when a third state interfered with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said he would carefully examine his candidacy for the presidency following the Middle-earth elections.
During a public assembly at Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It's time women go to Washington and repair the government fractured and this includes a woman in power," said, according to The Hill.
«After 6 November, I will carefully examine my candidacy for the presidency».
Warren heard of President Donald Trump during the public assembly, claiming he was "to bring this country by the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism to Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet that a FBI investigation is needed before voting.
However, in a survey published on Thursday, it was shown that most of the Warren's own electors do not believe that they were going to be presented in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said that the Senators would not submit their candidacy, according to the survey of the People's Center of Political Research at the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe.
The thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other notable names of the Democrats in connection with a possible candidacy in 2020 include the previous vice-president, Joe Biden, and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that he would officially decide before January, reported the Associated Press agency.

Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after settling in September
On Monday at night, he was arrested and charged him with a domestic violence incident
"With my own child is going through, with which you are going over again, I can see in other families that feel the consequences of the TEPT and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return" explained to the audience in a mitin of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

18 states and the Columbia District challenge the new asylum policy
Eighty states and the Columbia District support a judicial resource in relation to a new US policy that denies asylum from victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, 18-state representatives and the district presented a court commission report to Washington to support a asylum applicant who defies politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the president of the Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union (United States for Civil Liberties) presented in August against the federal policy was not revealed.
He told that his partner "and his sons of a violent criminal organization" abused it, but that the U.S. officials refused their asylum request on 20 July.
He stopped him in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, such as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and domestic violence.
The U.S.'s new policy of asylum has revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals, which allowed the documented immigrants to flee from domestic violence to asylum.
The general prosecutor of the Columbia District, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "nogras decades of state, federal and international legislation".
The federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be awarded in accordance with the specific circumstances of the application, and this prohibition was explained in the court's friend report.
Taxes continued to discuss the report that the policy rejects the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, explaining that it is likely to become entrepreneurs and that "force hands of work".
In June, the general prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, ordered the judges of immigration that did not give more asylum to victims fleeing from domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
"The asylum is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social or political opinion", declared sessions in their announcement of politics on 11 June.
The asylum was never intended to relieve all problems (even all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Raised rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims duplicates in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly aggravated.
The circumstances are very strained," says the mother of 35 years Risa Kusuma, consulating his fever at the evacuation centre of the city of Palu.
"Each minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their homes destroyed, collecting their belongings flooded, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of wounded people and hospitals, measured by 7.5°F (7.5°F) earthquake, are overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured the back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
The tears filled his eyes while explaining how he felt the violent earthquake hit the quarter of the hotel on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I believe" he told Haris to Associated Press, and added that his family was in a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I do not know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
The US ambassador accused China of exercising abuse with "propandistic ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily by pressing the benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of serving the American press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the US, referred to the payment supplement China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accused China of being entertained in the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, the fact that China denied.
The accusation of Trump that Beijing was trying to entertain himself in the United States elections, marked what the officials of that country coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coercize China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witnessing the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to China and the U.S. experts, China's compensatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm state exporters such as Iowa, which supports the Trump ́s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, one of the leading agricultural products exporters in China, claimed that Beijing harmed workers, farmers and US entrepreneurs.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Money Register, it has been shown that China "is intensifying that campaign of harassment by spreading propaganda ads in the free American press".
When spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the appreciated North American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
On the contrary, at the post of newspapers located at the end of this Beijing street, there are few dissident voices and no real reflection of the scattered opinions that Chinese can have on the worrying economic trajectory of China, given that the media are under the strong thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he adds.
He also stated that "one of the most important newspapers in China declined the offer to publish its article", although he did not confirm that it was a newspaper.
Kavanagh's disaster makes women's Republican vote a few days after the ruling election
Although many of the major Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanagh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, in spite of the various accusations of sexual aggressions, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially of the female voters, in the next half-mand elections.
The reactions around these accusations were numerous, and most Republicans were positioned to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell University of Syracuse School in an article published on Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also stated that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for a research of the FBI is enough to calm the spirits of the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, as well as they will not forget it in the near future or in November", reflected on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, main advise and national spokesman of the progressive MoveOn group, in the diary Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the opponents, to the group of "Acerse November!", were manifested in the Senate's corridor, while the Republicans, with the control of the judicial committee, decided to move forward with the appointment of Kavanagh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democrats' motivation and enthusiasm will overcome any expectations", he secured the news site Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
"It's true that it's already high,
but it is still more, especially among the undesired voters of neighborhoods on the outskirts or those who are between 18 and 29 years old, that although they do not like the President, they do not usually go to the urns."
Before Ford's public testimony details his accusations of sexual aggression against candidates from the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans went ahead with confirmation.
"This became a disaster for the Republican Party", Michael Steel, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of the week on NBC News channel.
This goes beyond the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bank of the defendants or not, the issue is how the Republicans managed and how they discussed it," Guy Cecil, chief of priorities USA, a group that helps the election of the Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided between believing the testimony of Ford or that of Kavanaugh, although they lean more to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the respondents are totally or likely to be Ford's testimony, compared to 35% that the Kavanaugh testimony supports.
In addition, 38% believe that the most probable thing is that Kavanagh lie during his testimony, compared to 30% that he thinks of the same Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford, as well as at least one accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford tested before the Senate's Judicial Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked it in a state of ebride when he was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he studied at Yale in the 80s.
The developer of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web inventor, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this legend of technology, is a company based on Solid, the open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and that people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee agreed that the intent that Inrupt hides is "to dominate the world".
"We have to do it", he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses the Solid Technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or POD.
Contact lists, pending, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify have been available on a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data storage unique is that the user has a complete control over who can access what information.
The company qualifies this as a "personal empowerment through data".
Inrupt's idea, according to his president John Bruce, is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to help Solid is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a company of IBM security, some developers hired to work on the project and a volunteer developer community.
From this week, developers around the world could create their own applications decentralised with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team talked to "Facebook or Google on whether or not to introduce their business models from one day to another.
"We do not need your permission."
In an article published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new website based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet into the World Wide Web Consortium community into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee was raised as an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, a clergyman held with the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only clergy of the Church of England who was decorated with the Cross of Victoria during the First World War received a posthumous tribute in his native city 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918, on the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without learning that they had awarded him the largest British military condor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were responsible for discovering a memorial monument in his honor in a parade in Rushden (Northamptonshire).
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, realized the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after the feat of his grandfather who deserved him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion to the Saint-Quentin channel "by a dense fog and under the witch of an intense fire of machine guns".
He later rushed to get to the line of fire and, with a "great brave", he headed the line ahead of precipitated with a cannon and without any help, and down to three people of the enemy's detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, of 72 years, stated that his grandfather's actions are "something that he could never live, but a lesson still so".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a flower crown after the parade, which headed the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honest to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig picks up the roll to the fans of MMA at the best time
Imagine that you take the whole night awake to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when it comes to the best part something rain prevents.
The poster of San Jose included 13 fights, six major, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But the 6th of the morning, just when Gegard Moussai and Rory MacDonald would see the guys, the spectators of the United Kingdom stayed at the time they saw appear Peppa Pig.
Some have not impressed them after having spent so many hours waiting to see the fight.
A hobby described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
The state regulations govern that this content was not appropriate for the 6th of the morning, and that's why it had to be changed to child programming,” he explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Marketing and Bellator Communication, when asked by the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, that's."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, stated that they will take into account UK viewers in future programs.
I think we can solve it when we think about repetition" said Coker.
"But if they are the 6 in the morning there, we can't fix it up to Sunday, which will already be Monday for them.
But we are working to find a solution.
When the change began to receive many messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But not, he was a government problem.
I promise that it will not happen again.
We will limit five fights, rather than six. We wanted to give the maximum to our fans, but we passed and
damage a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, Olympic jumper, claims that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to triumph.
This 24-year-old athlete stated that not everyone was like him until he came to the high school.
Invited to the first issue of the Desert Island Discs Radio 4 program led by Lauren Laverne, he explained that he began speaking of the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact of being a father helped him to re-enact the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the usual show, is down by disease.
As a guest of the first program led by Laverne, Daley shared that I felt "lower" to the rest of the people because "wasn't socially acceptable to you that the boys and girls liked."
He also stated that, "Up to today, that feeling of inferiority and of being different is what has driven me and gave me the force necessary to achieve success."
I wanted to show that it was "one" so people did not feel disappointed when discovering their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activists and used his appearance in the Commonwealth games of Australia to borrow more countries to depentalize homosexuality.
He decided to talk why he felt fortunate to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time World Champion said to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise".
Daley married this winner of an Oscar last year and affirms that the 20 years of difference between them were never a problem.
"When you live so little time" (with only 14 years first took part in the Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of your age who had experienced similar altixes.
The couple had their first son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely changed his perspective.
"If you wonder the past year, my greatest motivation would be to win a gold medal" says.
"But now I know there are much more important things than a gold Olympic medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked for his son were entries for London 2012, he wanted to be in the first row.
I was not able to tell you that I would not have been here to occupy this first row,” Daley shared.
"I was holding your hand when I stopped breathing and it was at that time of his death, when I realized I was not invincible" added.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that time I knew that this was the dream of my life: jumping in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling" confirmed.
The choice of the music from Heather Small is neither in vain, since it is the melody that accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympiads and still puts him the hairs of tip.

A low-shaped Mickelson ended up at the Ryder Cup bank this Saturday
The American Phil Mickleson will beat a record on Sunday when he played his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but it must improve his technique for this to not become an unhappy event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for 12.o time, was left on the bank by decision of Captain Jim Furyk and was not able to participate in the four-months of Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the helm of his career, his 48 years does not fit in the tight Le Golf National field, where high grass usually punishing the wrong shots.
And because of this it had not been enough, Mickelson faces the ninth game of the Sunday at the precise Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below starting the 12 individual matches, they begin with good foot, the performance of Mickeyson could be completely crucial.
Furyk relied on his man, though he could not say much more.
"I got to perfection the role I played today, I gave me a bleed in the shoulder, got my arm and told me that tomorrow would be ready", he shared Furyk.
"I fully relied on myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame, and has long provided teams in the past and this week.
He probably thought he had played two games.
I thought I would play more, but at the end they are the things and so we think they should be.
Like everyone, you want to be out."
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the largest number of games played on the Ryder Cup.
He could score the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual palm trees.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven floors, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangible amounts to the team.
"It's a funny, sarcastic, with wit and likes to stick to people, it's a good kind to have on the team", he explained.
"I like to see how well the most young players have spent on this week.
It's much more with a good player."
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup can become easily awkward journey.
The Grand Danes debuted in 1997 in a federal match, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the US, but ended up finishing the goal line with a minimum advantage of winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
We continue thinking that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; like in Brookline, where we lose, but in Valderrama we won by little", reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the promotion of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 in the Le Golf National.
The story shows that this has not yet finished.
Tomorrow you have to go to for all.
It is necessary to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the bookmark.
Our goal is to earn that trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won’t get tired of saying it, I’m concentrated on our 12 players on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Loved with the performance of their players in a hard golf field, Bjorn added: "I would never win before time.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual actions, and there we also have to demonstrate our value.
It is great to be with a partner next when things go well, but when you face things individually, then test your ability as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to transmit to the players, who take out the best of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner back, and he must also take the best of yourself."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek their players to have a better individual performance than their peers, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brookline, but finishing as a loser after European miracle in Medinah."
"I remember each of the damn words," answered when asked to remember how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brings together the players for the last day.
We have 12 important parties, but you would want to have a quick start like that of Brooklyn or that of Medinah.
When you see that the boost goes in a direction, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We prepared our alignment taking into account and putting the players as it seemed, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the combat and face Rory McIllyroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the upper half of the standings.
I decided this order because I think it fills all the way,” said Bjorn about his selection for individuals.
The new warship of Germany once again put
The youngest of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not reach at least the next year due to defective systems and the cost of increasing, reported local media.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Palatinate", the leading flaming ship of Baden-Württemberg class, was delayed until the first half of 2019, as reported by a military spokesperson to the journal Die Zeit.
The vessel should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery affected the destination of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which the Navy commissioned in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
They are understood to have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-bulk missiles, as well as with concealing technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, should be possible to deploy the youngest frigates up to two years outside the departure ports.
However, as the point is Die Zeit, these constant delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that Germany will project their power abroad will be outdated when they come into service.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was notified last year, when the German Navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy would return a ship to a constructor after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German communications media spoke of "critical defects in the software and hardware" that fueled the use of the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg classships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
It is thought that the Rhine-Palatinate of 7 thousand tons weighed twice that of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total price of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the amazing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the 2200 million initials.
The problems of the youngest frigates are particularly important to the light of the recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is doing waters.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, recognized that the Navy is running out of suitable ships to deploy.
The official affirms that this problem is growing, since the old ships were withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frauds in the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust the secret life of bats
A new investigation that is being carried out on a farm of the Highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape to find food.
The results are expected to be light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipestrillus pygmaeus and Pipestrillus pipistrellus, as well as the batotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the gardens of Inverwe in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the bat activities during the season.
The personnel and volunteers of NHS will also conduct mobile polls with manual drivers.
An analysis of sound realized by experts of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and that is doing each species.
Below, a map of habitat will be developed to create a detailed image of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, advisor to Conservation of the nature of NTS, expects that the results show that areas of the habitat are more important for bats and how they use them each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and which is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom decreased considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect nests and habitat loss.
Aerogenerators and aluminum also pose a risk, as well as sticky traps for flies, some chemical construction treatments, and home cats attacks.
bats are not blind,
but due to their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated geolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
The NT, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously the bats.
It has ten experts trained, who conduct surveys periodically, nest inspections and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reservoir of bats in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bats.
David Thompson, the manager of Estate, affirms that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large area for bats", he claims.
We have ancient buildings, historical trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we do not know about bats, so the work we carry out here and in other properties will help you better understand what they need to thrive."
It stands out the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks in properties, since it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nest of maternity can kill up to 400 females and hatchlings, which could exterminate the entire local population.
bats are a protected species and are illegal to kill them, harass them or bother them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the official school of the Bat Conservation Trust organization, encourages people to help:
"There is still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many species, we do not know how you are going to their populations."
Ronaldo dismissed the demands for violations and his lawyers are prepared to demand the German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the accusations of violation against him as false, claiming that the only person who wants is to be known using his name.
His lawyers will demand the journal Der Spiegel by posting these accusations.
The front of Portugal and the Juventus was accused of violating Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
She admits that the footballer paid to the woman 375 000 USD so that she did nothing about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after its release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, played this news of fake in a live video from his Instagram account, which counts 142 million followers.
"No, not and a thousand times not.
What was said today is false," said before the camera the five-time Golden Ball winner.
" People want to make known using my name.
It is normal,
want to be famous with just say my name, it is part of my work.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player to smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to sue Der Spiegel on accusations, which qualify as "an unmatched declaration of suspicions in the privacy area" according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would request compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of the personal rights of recent years".
The incident would have occurred in June 2019, at a suite of Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Having met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would have returned the room for the player, where he was allegedly in person, according to the documents presented at the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, was kneeled saying that he was 99 % a knight, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents ensure that Ronaldo confirms that both of them have retained sexual intercourse contained by both parties.
Mayorga also argued that he attended the police and that he had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because he was attracted by the counter-attacks and was concerned about public slavery.
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the agreement while continuing to be traumatised by the incident.
At the time of the supposed crime, Ronaldo was on the verge of meeting with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer joined the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Automobile manufacturers would leave the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom would forever lose its position as a world auto-making leader after Brexit, according to the business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was worried that Toyota UK had stated on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, would temporarily stop the production of his Burnaston factory near Derby.
"It is necessary to reach an agreement", added Clark.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer stated that, in the event that the Brexit had not reached any deal, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, in charge of manufacturing the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced about 150 000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
In my opinion, if Britain left the EU at the end of March, we will be witnesses how production stops in our factory" said Marvin Cooke, general director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automobile manufacturers also expressed their fear before the EU's abandonment without achieving an agreement on the operation of trade between the borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that he would close his Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in case a deal is not reached in the Brexit.
Toyota's production line is highly adjusted, every 37 minutes the UK and EU supplier parts for custom cars.
If on 29 March, the EU has not reached an agreement, the border may be affected and delays and shortages could be generated.
The company claimed that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal rate more than one day at Derby's plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that the Theresa May plan for future relations with the EU is "constrainedly accurate in order to avoid such border controls."
And we want you to be the best deal, so enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity” said in the BBC Radio 4 program.
The Toyota experience and other manufacturers need to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long the production stopped, but cautioned that in the long run the costs added would reduce the competition of the plant and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalris, employee of Burnaston for 24 years and union coordinator of Unit, said his members are increasingly concerned: "For experience, I know once these jobs disappear, never return.
A government spokesperson claimed that he presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU.
The Trump Meeting with Rosenstein could postpone again
The White House claimed that the high-risk meeting of Donald Trump and court secretary Rosenstein could delay a week more due to the candidate's struggle with the Supreme Court of Hanover.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian interference in election, the links between the assistants of Russia and Trump, and the possible obstruction to the justice by the president.
Both Trump bids to the Deputy Attorney General and, if not, what would jeopardize Mueller's independence, fueled rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record the conversations with Trump and the possibility of replacing the President with the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, between reports he indicated that he was about to resign.
On the other hand, a meeting with Trump was announced, who was in New York, on Thursday.
Trump said he would not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a crash with the hearing of the Senate judicial committee in which they testified Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuses him of sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation to the FBI about the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no fixed date, this week or delayed a more week, given everything that is happening on the Supreme Court.
We will see, but you know I like the press is informed."
Some journalists questioned that statement, since Sanders has taken from September 10 without holding a press conference.
When the presenter Chris Wallace asked him the reason,
Sanders stated that the lack of informative session was not due to an aversion to the greatness of the reporters, although he added that he will not be denied that attitude.
He also suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president" said, although he did not cite any sources that had supported these data.
They will continue to hold informative meetings, he said Sanders, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask him directly to the President of the United States, this is much better than to direct questions to her.
You are testimonies of how we do this for the last few weeks, and this will replace a press conference in which you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when you leave the White House or participate in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president has shown the reason for this week in New York, with a free appearance and sometimes strange before the communists gathered.
A letter from the health secretariat to calm down the moods before the Brexit
The Secretary of Health has led a letter to EU workers in the NHS of Scotland in which he expresses the gratitude of the country and communicates his desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government committed to covering the cost of status requests covered by EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: " During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the abandonment continued, and he is expected to make decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also intensified its preparations for a possible non-agreement situation.
I know this is a period of rest for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond, contribute an experience and indisputable skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities to which we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, lineback of the Tennessee State Tigers, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering a crash on the head during the defeat of Saturday (31-27) against the Commodores, reported as a tensane organ.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State coach, reported reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he went on to reach the line of the band.
Coaches and the medical staff gave him oxygen in the band's line before taking him in the champagne to conduct a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician reported Chris Harris, WSMV journalist in Nashville, that Abercrombie was recovering from the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details of the type or scope of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when such injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year-old red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five full entrances on Saturday before the match, which raised 18 his total of the season.
A fire tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK
Foreign traders will be charged a higher timbre tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help people without home due to new plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of the Corbyn campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the tax of the timbre will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury is expected to collect up to £120 million a year to help people without home
Foreign traders will be charged a higher timbre tax when they buy a property in the UK. Teresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help people without home.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of the Jeremy Corbyn campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible housing and focus on people with high income.
The increase in timbre tax will apply the people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money will be used to support the government campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep in the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current tax of timbre, including the highest levels introduced two years for the second houses and the purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
Farm expects the change to get up to £120 million per year.
About 13% of the new constructions carried out in London are bought by not residents in the United Kingdom, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people to buy for the first time a house to access the real estate market.
Many wealthy parts of the country, especially in the capital, became "mast cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson requested the application of a cut in the tax of transmission of finance to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large-scale builders of keeping housing prices on the purchase of soil and the non-use of it, and urged Mrs. May to eliminate tax revenues over the moderate price houses to repair the "spoke of the house" that is living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposals for reforms related to housing, including the control of rents and the prohibition of evictions in which the tenant does not have the fault.
You also want to give the highest municipalities to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "The past year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for this it is necessary to repair the disastrous market of the house.
Great Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is just the same as simple for those who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to buy houses that for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of being owners of a house is too far, and the indignity that supposes not having a ceiling continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland”
The manager of the Sunderland, Jack Ross, stated that his "last ambition" consists of becoming Scotland's selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the northwest, which currently occupies the third place in the League One, three points away from the head.
He reached the Stadium of Light this summer after taking the St. Miren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was playing my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B selection, and this was all," Ross said to the BBC Sportsound program.
I grew up playing Scotland in Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something that I always wanted to live again.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed directing a club."
Ross's predecessors included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Cano.
The previous manager of the Alloa Athletic affirms that he did not feel sorry for happening those figures so consolidated in a club so big after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me will depend on this time if I can return this club to Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undeniably owned by a Premier League club, he said.
"You won't be a simple task to get it, but it's likely that you can only succeed here if I can return the club to Premier".
Ross only takes three years as a coach after a period of assistant at the Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the Hearts technical staff.
In that period he helped the Alloa to recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get the St Miren to get the title of the Championship the next season.
Ross now claimed to be more comfortable than ever encountered during his career as a player in the Clyde, in the Talkkirk, St Miren and the Hamilton Academical.
"I probably found me in a real crossroads", he recalled, on taking charge of the Alloa.
I really thought that training was perfect for me, even more than to play.
It sounds rare because it wasn’t wrong, I gained the life well and enjoyed some successes.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you need to surpass every week.
Keep suffering from stress and labor pressure, but train them like.
I've always liked training and now that I'm doing, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life."

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a picture is the 17:30 of a Saturday
The summer heatwave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulties, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pubs and bars experienced growth of 2.7 percent during July, but consumption in the restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent according to the figures.
Peter Martin, a member of the CGA trade advisory, in charge of compiling the figures, stated: "The sunny days and the permanence of England in the world of football for longer than the expected period in July, was shown by a pattern similar to that of June, in which the pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although the restaurant suffered an even greater punishment.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the business volume of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specializing in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
The pubs specializing in meals also suffered the sun, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It looks like if people just wanted to get out of drinking.
In the pubs and bars controlled beverage consumption increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food was reduced by three percent.
Paul Newman, employee of the RSM for recreational and hospitality analysis, stated: "These results are a continuation of the trend that has been produced since the end of April.
The time and impact of the main social and sports events continue to be the main factors related to consumption outside the house.
It does not surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a drop of 4.8 per cent will be especially painful if the continuous increase of costs is added.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for catering businesses and the time will be in charge of saying if the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the so necessary respire for the sector.
The total growth of sales in the pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in the releases of the brands.
The indicator for sales Coffer Peach Tracker Industry from the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with joint benefits of over 9,000 million pounds and is considered the point of reference in the sector.
One of every five children has secret social media accounts that conceal their parents
One of every five children (some of only 11 years) have secret social networks that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey
A poll made to 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the number of "False" pages
This news increased the fear that sexual content is published
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a "main account" to show their parents
One of every five children (some of only 11 years) are creating social media accounts that keep secret to adults.
A poll made to 20,000 secondary students revealed a growth in the number of accounts of "False" (in reference to the social network of Instagram photos).
This news has led to an increase in fear that sexual content is published.
Twenty percent of the students claimed that they used a "main" account that was smoothed to show their parents while having other private.
A mother who had come across the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl who called her "viorate".
Research, conducted by Digital Shannon UK and the Headmasters" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, noticed that 40 percent of boys and girls between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, stated: "It turns out to be alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces in which parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eildh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish federation council of athletics
Eildh Doyle was chosen for the advice of the Scottish federation of athletics as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most prized Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys an enormous respect within the Scottish community, from the UK and worldwide level, and we are sure that Scottish athletics will benefit greatly from its incorporation into the board", he said Beattie.
Doyle asserted: "I have many desire to make a spokesman of athletes and I hope to contribute and help lead sport in Scotland".
The American, which won the 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlanta Games between a total of four Olympic gold and currently worked as a regular participant for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote in Twitter: "There's a month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time could determine if it could be recovered and till it grades.
It was a exhausted job, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk and do exercises of agility.
Thank you for the messaging of mind"
An ad of a breast milk extract that compares women with cows to the public opinion on the networks
A company of maternal milk extracters divided the public opinion into the nets with an advertisement that compares mothers with cows to which it is jerking.
To announce the release of the proclaimed "first synthetic maternal milk extracter from the world", the company Elvie published an ironic advertisement to the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new milk extracter to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a celer full of ugly to the cows at the pace of a song with letters like the following: "Yes, my mume to me, but I do not have a tail" and "For if you haven't told you, I'm not cloudy, I'm not my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Muxe, muke, I'm feeding the babes, muke, muke, I'm witching my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, provoked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 copies and hundreds of comments, the video brought different reactions among viewers. Many of them claimed that the "horros" of the dairy sector manifests.
"Use cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but if we steal their children days after giving birth, he wrote one.
The milk extracter Elvie can be placed discreetly inside a maternal bran (Elvie/nai)
Another spectator commented: "Clariously trauma to the mother and the baby.
But yes, why are they not used to advertise a milk extract for mothers who are left with their babies?"
Another viewer added the following: "What ad with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the advertisement, even a woman stated that the song appeared to him "very graceful".
It seems to me that it is a great idea.
If you were still giving the chest, you would buy one.
Take my milk made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit shot, but I interpret it as a joke.
I look like a great product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny advertisement to the mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or in baths) and they feel like "homes".
This is not an advertisement to praise nor judge the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted in their braids.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extract is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be directly fit into a maternal brax, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out there while extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, a creative partner and director of Mother commented: "The extracter Elvie is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
When describing the existing parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges we have shown in an entertaining and close sense of freedom that the new extract will offer.
It is not the first time Elvie extract occupied the headlines of newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-story mother paradesed the designer Marta Jakobowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrants held increased despite the monthly number of crosses of the border remained relatively unchanged, partly due to strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the administration Trump hindered the allocation of godfathers for children.
Traditionally, most godparents were also immigrants with no papers and were afraid of putting their ability to stay in the country forward to claiming a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that possible godparents and other adult households would have to send their digital fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high office of the U.S. Customs Immigration and Control Service, testified before the Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who requested to take advantage of without company.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arresters had no criminal offences.
About 80% of people who are godfathers or who are part of their homes are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue those individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children with greater speed, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of these to appear in the court before a month has elapsed as of 60 days, which was the previous rule, in accordance with the workers of the refuge.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements to receive assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they remain under custody, the more likely they will have to become eager or depressed, which can lead to violent or attempted escapes according to the workers of the refuge and reports of the system published for the last months.
The lawyers asserted that such fears increase in centers of greater dimensions as that of Tornillo, in which there is more chance that the symptoms of a child is happening wrongly due to his size.
They also added that they move children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could suppose a trauma that many continue suffering.
Syria requests the U.S., France, and Turkey employment forces that are immediately withdrawn
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the position of Vice Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were in silly soil, with the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they would occupy them in the appropriate way".
"They must immediately withdraw and without conditions", he communicated to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 60,000 people died since 2011 and millions had to flee from their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleaned all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "all foreign illegal presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly to train and advise the Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose the President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this country devastated by the war.
On the subject of refugees, Moualem declared that the appropriate conditions for his return were due to "some western countries" of the "division of irrational fears" that the refugees did not return.
We have "returned to the international community and organization to facilitate these reversions", he said.
"They are politicing what should be a mere human matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that they will not offer aid to the reconstruction for Syria until a political agreement occurs between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that the recent agreement reached between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib allowed to continue with political conversations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear limits" and expressed its hope that military actions had as a destination, including soldiers from front Al-Nusra linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The UN Staffan by Misturas is hoping to announce the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to create a draft of a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the celebration of elections.
Moualem stated the conditions to ensure the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the agency should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against potential interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would achieve reelection in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
In what undoubtedly it would be "The most dramatic end of a presidency"
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, the first-time hearing rates have been multiplied by more than two, to reach 1,05 million viewers in CNN and nearly tripled up to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first-time schedule, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago by Nielsen, and the programme "The Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC led the audience indexes of the cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the nights in which important news were produced.
It is like a fire that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama for the ABC "Designed Survivor", that it is a secretary of the ministerial ministry that becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a lively comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hards About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, he asked him.
"He replied, "For I laugh", told me Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment within chaos.
Naturally, unlike all others that appear on television, Washington’s plots can determine the future of the case Roe against Wade, if the migrant families can meet again and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting the reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Even so, it supposes something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spend six hours seeing a panel of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward from "anonymously" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's ostrich skin jacket ("a garment full of arrogance", he said Washington Pos) and the implications of the dark descriptions of Stormy Daniels on the anatomy of Mr. Trump.
I won’t look at Super Mario in the same way.
Part of what makes you look like a reality show is that you are giving something new every night," Brent Montgomery, High Executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", a space that deals with the daily story changes to Trump’s show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praises to Kim Jong-un...).

He was not able to disengage while Brett Kavanagh was about to deal with the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depending on a thread.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at that time and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", I told me Mr. Fleisch.
I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out that I had reason."

The external money comes to many to finance the candidacys to the House for the election of half of the legislature
Not surprising that the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania is getting a great flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two representatives in career roles to occupy the same position.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, which was recently reorganized by the democratic candidate, Conor Lamb, who achieved his position in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb appears against another representative in functions, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely over the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania determined in January that Republicans manipulate the electoral constituency of the former districts in their favour.
The electoral race in the new 17th congressional district highlighted a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congress's Democratic Campaign Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after he achieved a tight victory in the special March election for the 18th Parliamentary District of Pennsylvania, which enjoyed extensive monitoring.
That post was occupied by a republic for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won in District for 20 points.
Political experts grant democratics a slight advantage.
The United States valued the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for his support in China and then broke back
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama already recognize Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump maintained a friendly meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and even had a hotel in Panama until his partners moved to the executive team of the Trump Organization.
The state department officials decided to return to the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "by recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", according to Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the department in a statement this month.
However, the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately 140 million U.S. dollars during 2017, including monitoring the narcotic, development, and financial help.
Proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and Visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment rates and assassinations.
As internal, American and Central American officials advanced, they held a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to perform a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to avoid emigration from people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administrative officials left clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, effectively putting an end to any possibility of applying sanctions for El Salvador.
It is scheduled for Vice President Mike Pence to head the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a symptom of the importance of the administration, to affirm the diplomats.
The three American envoys returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for the White House of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak about internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants was maintained.
Your accounts have been corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and have also agreed to speak whenever your anonymity is retained.
Study history
The next negative case could be the report of Robert Mueller's special adviser on the case of possible obstruction to the justice of Mr. Trump, of which there are abundant evidence in the public archive.
As stated, Mr. Mueller is also directing his research to find out if the campaign of Mr. Trump conspired with Russia in his attack to our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump must give accounts in that body, just when you have to prepare for elections, and it may eventually have to face a popular jury.
They are many incognites and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as well as that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovak ones in Munich.
We fail and we lose the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that occurred later.
The course of the story revolves around these turning points, and the unexorable advance of democracy will be accelerated or backward.
The Americans face several of these turning points at the time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump bids the Attorney General Assistant of the State, Rod Rosenstein, the man controlling the fate of the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein carries water to the neck from the newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested recording the president secret and speculated that he was incapacitated for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the information on The Times is not true.
How will we respond if the investigation that has been recently requested by the F.B.I. about Brett Kavanaugh is not incomplete or is not impartially or whether it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the perceived accusations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And above all, will we vote in the election of half legislature for a Congress requiring responsibilities to Mr Trump?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will be subject to a long winter.
But I think we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jewish who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was also my home, which was from the embasssy.
He survived, emigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, he sent me to press Shabat's channels on that table that included a scarlet.
With that inheritance, how will I not be optimistic about the future?"

The Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about finding the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers received the Rapid Vienna Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive hit in Spain compared to the Villarreal this month, they placed them in a very favorable position to qualify for the G group of Europe League.
An injury in the knee prevented Graham Dorrans from debuting this season up to the 2-2 against the Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use as a trampleline to get more important things.
"It was a good point for us, because the Villarreal is a good team", declared the player of 31 years.
"We enter the game believing that we could achieve something positive and we get a point.
We had the opportunity to win at the end, but in general probably the draw is a fair result.
They were probably better during the first half, but in the second we were superior.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to reach the three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year it was hard among all that happened with my injuries and changes in the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the boys are going well and the trainings are good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget about the past season and succeed."
Women care about savings for their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear how they wanted them to take care of, little people spoke with their family about the matter.
About half of the participants in this study reported that they were committed to their pairs the cost of prolonged care.
Just 10% stated that they had talked to their children about the subject.
"The people want you to care for a family, but they are not carrying out the necessary measures to have this conversation", said Holy Snyder, vice-president of the New Wave's life insurance department.
They can start for the next.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family so that they can match you if you don't communicate your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your adviser and your family to agree where and how to receive the care, since these decisions can be a determining factor at the time of determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your adviser will also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Among the financing options for prolonged care insurance are a traditional prolonged insurance policy, a hybrid life policy of effective value to help cover these expenses or the self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Trade your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a reliable health care representative to test your medical care and ensure that your professionals meet your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
It also assesses the possibility of signing a notarial power to manage your finances.
You will have to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and a tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to rise.
Due to the court of communications, rescue bodies could not obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area located north of Palu that is closest to the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after disaster.
Below we provide some key data about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when earthquakes and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that is over 300 km (62 mi) northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
This regency, a lower administrative region, had an approximate population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala were affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is on the high-tech seismic fire belt, so it has regular earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis suffered during the last years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the Province of Aceh of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, leading to the deaths of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Ache.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes affected Sumatra's west coast in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 degrees of magnitude struck south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, causing the death of almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 degrees of magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake affected the islands of Mentawai, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of peoples and led to the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A gentle earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jaya, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remember the devastation caused by the mortals and tsunami of 2004.
On this occasion no tsunami had occurred, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which caused the death of more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily pulled out.
They arrest Sarah Palin's eldest son for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested.
Palin, 29-year-old, natural from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for a crime of domestic violence, to prevent the submission of a report by domestic violence and by resistance to the authority, in accordance with a note published by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to denounce the alleged crimes, he took off the phone.
Palin remains in prison in the dependencies of the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a bail of $500, as reported to KUTU.
He was presented to the court on Saturday, in which he stated "not guilty, since then" when he was asked, reported the chain.

He was also accused of minor crime of type B, punishable with a prison day and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time criminal charges against Palin are presented.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Court for war veterans in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, preventing the submission of a domestic violence report, and by weapons possession in an embryo in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of proprieting him a puncture on his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after linking the violent behavior of his son with the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome suffered after serving with the army in Iraq.
An earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia causes hundreds of deaths
They are told at least 384 dead after the earthquake that affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the death balance is expected to be increased over the days.

They circulate videos through the social networks in which the impact time is shown.
Hundreds of people were gathered in a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal taxes seek to apply a few times a penalty of death for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayful Saipov, the suspected New York terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, used a truck rental of Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle lane from the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, following the life of the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Siov killed "intentionally" the eight victims and that it caused serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intention of a death request presented in the South District of New York.
Both crimes involve the possibility of applying death penalty according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov a 22- crime imputation, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, often practiced by the prosecutors in the cases of organized crime, and a violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required a "noble planning and predictment", declared the fiscals by describing the way in which Siov carried out the "atroz, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullabulevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as indicated in the notice of an accusation.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago that the South District of New York does not process a case of death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but the perpetual chain was finally sentenced in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted by conspiracy to compete for the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electrical chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov (born in Uzbekistan) demonstrated a lack of regret for the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He declared the researchers that he felt well for what he had done, according to the police.
Saipov declared the authorities to carry out the attack, inspired by the ISIS videos that he displayed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also requested to see the flag of the ISIS in his hospital room, he claimed the police.
He declared no guilty of the accusation of 22 crimes.
David Patton, one of the federal trade lawyers responsible for representing Siov, indicated that they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision of the accusation.
"We believe that the decision to ask the death penalty rather than accepting a penalty declaration of guilt with perpetual chain without chance of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all persons involved", he said Patton.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the tax that did not request the death penalty.
A Tory Parliament states that NIGEL FARAGE should be at the head of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised “mobilize a “people’s army” today during a protest in the tory conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party stated that politicians had to “sensing the pressure” of the Euroeptics (when one of Theresa's own supporters May suggested that it should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
The ordinary deputy Peter Bone claimed before the demonstration of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already have left the EU if Mr. Farage was the secretary of the Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to reconcile the divided ranks of his party was evident by joining the favourable Tories to remain in the EU to an independent protest against the Brexit held in the city.
The first minister is fighting to maintain the compromises of his plan of Chequers between the attacks of supporters of Brexit, the opposites and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continued to attempt an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force the Europeans and the laborers to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of the Lee Lee's Silent Movement that he wanted to end the Chequers' plan.
He suggested that he should have counted Mr. Farage to take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If you were given the charge, we would have already been out of EU at these times,” he said.
Wellington's member added the following: "I will continue to defend the Brexit, but we must abort the Chequers plan".
Showing his opposition to the EU, he stated: "We don't fight world wars to be served.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone denied the suggestions he said that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain in the EU is completely false".
The member of the Tories and Party of the Brexit Andrea Jenkins also attended the march, from which he told reporters: "The only thing I say is: first minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to start, are those who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, he added: "The first ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage stated in the concentration that it is necessary to "fearless" politicians if they intend to process the decision made in the referendum of 2016.
«It is currently a reliable topic among us, the people, and our political class», said.
«They are trying to deal with the decision of Brexit and here we are gathered today to tell them that we will not leave them out of their own».
In a message addressed to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to do that our political class, which is about to process the decision of Brexit, if you feel uncomfortable.
«We are mobilizing the army of people in this country who gave us victory in the Brexit and that will not rest until we turn into a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom».
Meanwhile, the supporters of staying in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
Some activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit (Tories against Brexit) after the start of the group this weekend.
The Labourman Lord Adonis was mocked by security problems suffered in an application of the party at the start of the conference.
«This is the people who say that they can have the IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a border without friction, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland», he added.
«It is an absolute farce.
The concept of Brexit does not exist", he added.
Warren plans to think seriously for the presidency
U.S. senator Elizabeth Warren claimed that he would think his candidacy for the presidency after the elections of November.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about its future Saturday during a municipal meeting in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, is presented to re-election in November against the Republican Geoff Dihl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been a focus on speculations that position it as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon at Holyoke was its 36th meeting with its electors using the format of the town council since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to submit the president.
Warren replied that it is the time that "we are going to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for this it does a woman in the position of the presidency".
A detention was made related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the player of the Lsu
Baton Rouge's policeman, Los Angeles, announced that a suspect was arrested by the murder of Wayde Sims, the basketball player of the Lsu on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, of 20 years, in a press conference held at 11:00 (east time).
They published a video of the shooting on Friday asking help to identify a man who left in the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed near the Southern University campus at the first time of Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a ball wound on the head and eventually died as a result of this", he communicated the head of police Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday through 247sports.
Wayne became interested in defending his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and admitted to be present in the scene with a gun and admitted to shoot the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and placed under custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 2-metre youth that grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 past season titles and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world title thanks to the team's orders, which allowed him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who departed from pole position, left Hamilton only while defending his position for the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to run on the back of the group, something that would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in pits one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after several wheeled manoeuvres that caused Ferrari's driver to fail the interior to take off after a double defensive maneuver on the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the starting grid and went back to seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to the fact that he retained his tyres to go faster at the end and forward Kimi Räikkönen for the fourth position.
He finally entered the pits on lap 44 but failed to score at the last eight laps, ending with Räikkönen in the fourth place.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
A slightly suitable body language
President Donald Trump was mocked by Senator Dianne Feinstein in an event held on Saturday because of his insistence when he was not filing the letter of Christine Blasey Ford in which he accused Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
In a speech conducted in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "misperable, disgusting and liar".
«The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening last days in the Senate, when you see the indignation, when you see that people who are angry and that is miserable, disgusting and liar», he said.
«When you see these publications and filtrations and they claim: “oh, I was not.
I have not been."
Are they reminded?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leakage?
Remember your answer... have you filtered the document?: "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not been.
Wait a moment.
We filter it?...No.", added imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter in which the allegations were reported against Kavanagh made by Ford in July and filtered in early September, but Feinstein denied that the filtration came from her office.
I did not hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I did not filter his story," he said Feinstein as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep his confidentiality and do what I asked for.
But his denial did not seem to sit well at the president, who commented the next day during the act of Saturday at night: “I tell you that the body language was not appropriate.
He may not filter it, but he used the worst body language I saw in my life.
Continuing with his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of inadequate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
«They are decided to recover the power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to catch up to regain power and control,” said the president according to mediate.

An air traffic controller is killed to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape from an earthquake
An air controller of Indonesia considered hero to die to make sure an aircraft loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of dead people is 800 and there are many missing after a large earthquake shakes the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and are many people who are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his workingmates fled to save his lives, Anthony Guanawan Agug, of 21 years, refused to abandon his position in the control tower of the airport Mutualara Sis Al Jufri of Palu, which was violently balanced.
He stayed in his position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the exit track at that time, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Syriat, claimed that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, reported the ABC News channel in Australia.
We prepare a helicopter from Balppan in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, this morning died before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
«Removes us the heart when entering us», added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the balance of deaths may be thousands, and the country's disaster management agency stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
«The victim balance is thought to be able to continue increasing because there are many bodies under the rubble and it was not possible to reach many of them», said Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the spokesman of the agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting help and lives.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said the following to Sky News: "Each minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting the minimarkets".
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, declared the CNN: "The Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse.”
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and communicated to the country's military: "I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.

The airline operating a flight crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing one after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew had left without incidents the aircraft that was sinking.
Air Niugini claimed that from Saturday afternoon they were not able to locate a passenger.
The airline communicated that he was working together with the authorities, hospitals and local researchers to try to locate this man.
The airline immediately replied to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash of the plane against the water while trying to land at the airport of the island of Chuuk.
The authorities claimed the Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the aircraft landed in the pond before arriving at the landing track.
Some witnesses state that the plane has gone through the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American national passenger, commented that he entered very little height.
"This is something extremely positive", he said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that was coming to the waist until the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He also recalled that flight attendants were screaming and scary, and that he suffered a slight wound on the head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that some sailors were working close to the place on the improvement tasks of a dock also helped the rescue by using an inflatable boat to move people to the coast before the aircraft sank approximately 30 meters.

An analyst composes the timeline of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution was sent to the Saturday in the repetition of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in the year 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described the jury as using the records of a mobile phone to recall the movement of the accused of 29 years, Quinton Tellis, and the victim of 19, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowling stated that she received data from the location of several mobile phones that she showed that Tellis was the night of her death by contradicting her earlier claims as the newspaper The Clarion Ledger reported.
When these data proved that his mobile phone was with Chambers for the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford went on to the road on Saturday and testified that the day was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was saying the truth when he said that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "mining, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis knew to Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they were only known for a week.
Rowling stated that a time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed messages, calls, and the contact information of Chambers of their phone.
"Browsed her from her life," said Hale.
It is scheduled that the defence begins its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be seen for judgment on the jury the same day.

Another black?!
A New York children's caretaker demands a couple after a "racist" message
A caretaker of New York children will demand a couple by discrediting after receiving a message that was not directed to her from the mother in which she complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares demand with an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed his distress to finding that the boy's caregiver Giselle Maurice was black when he presented his first working day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOON, OTHER NEGRA", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, a "incomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, stating that the caregiver that had just gone, who was African American, had made his job wrong and expected a philin according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice paid the day of work and sent her home in a Uber.
Now Maurice will demand the couple to get a compensation for the dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who had been initially contracted even if there was no contract by means.
Look, I want to show them that these things are not done,” said to the Post on Friday, to later add "It's a case of discrimination".
The couple replied to the accusations of racism that he dismissed Maurice was the most reasonable, since they were afraid of trusting her after she offended her.
"My wife will send you a message that I did not intend to send you.
It is not racist.
We are not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
But would their children leave in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was due to an error?
Does your baby newborn?
Come!
After comparing the demand with an "extortion", Placus declared that his wife had a baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
"Go go for a person like that?
That's not very ethical," added the investment banker.
While the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple in social networks, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
Paddington editors fear that readers will not be identified with a single speaker as they can be completed in a new letter
Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented the following on the letter: "It is difficult to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before he was published.
It turns out to be very fun to know now what we know about the enormous success of Paddington.
After stating that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work was rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agicide" after his death last year.
From Paddington, which he describes as a "very important member of our family", added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally reached.
"It was a quiet man and nothing presumptive", he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you had a child who got something: you are proud even if you did not really.
I think that I felt the success of Paddington a little in that way.
Though it was a creation and product of his imagination, he always gave him all the merit to the own Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say through the phone
After landing, his daughter was quickly driven to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save him life.
Nad called regularly to say that he was very wrong, that he was not expected to survive.
Then I got the call from Nad to tell me that I would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to it.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I want a lot, my love.
I will meet you soon.
I will be with you.
Medicines that doctors had given their heart continue to lact up slowly and abandon their body.
Already died a while before and now I was extinguishing.
He just had to sit down and wait, knowing that he was happening.
I could not shout or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at this time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane along with other passengers, without notice of the calvarium that was suffering.
No man identified it,” he said.
"He had my head low and fell tears at all times.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this amazing feeling of solidarity by Nad.
What I needed my love and understanding.
He knew how much he wanted it.”
postcards from women afflicted to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys carry cards on a Welsh bridge with messages of inspiration and phone numbers that can be called to ask for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer depression, and committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any father to feel like I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, who lives in Lyndeney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
" Everyone knew about his smile.
They always said that their smile would light up any room.”
However, he left the job before he died and was "a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis commented: "I have the worry continuing to produce a collateral effect".
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and with whom to speak, even if you are a friend.
Do not be silent, you need to speak."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"I didn't tell me that I was sad or depressed or not like anything like it", he said.
«A couple of days before Christmas, we detect a change in their attitude.
Christmas’s day played bottom (when the children opened their gifts, they did not make visual contact with them nor anything).
He stated that his death supposed a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He wasted the family.
Please, let us know.
But we have to move forward and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanagh has lost a thread while the FBI starts research
I thought, if we could get something like what was asking (a research for a limited time and limited), it is possible that we could obtain a bit of unit,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that the committee was "bread" due to the paralysing of the supporters.
Why wanted Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters to conduct research?
Its recience is due to a matter of deadlines.
There are five weeks remaining for the legislature elections (on November 6). If, as expected, republics obtain bad results, they will be weakened in their attempts to achieve the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush was a senator, serving pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom Ashley met, who was the personal secretary of Mr. Bush.
What will happen when the FBI conducts his report?
A vote will occur in the Senate, which currently occupy 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanagh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserts in North Korea under Kim's command
The number of North Korea deserts bound the South Korea reduced from Kim Jong Un's access to power seven years ago, as reported by a South Korea legislature.
Park Byeong-seg, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, claimed to have occurred 1,127 losses in the past year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the streamlining of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs charged by people on the other side of the border have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not conducted any public commentary.
Most of the Northern deserts are finally given the citizenship of South Korea.
He declared that more than 30,000 North Koreans crossed the border from the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest border stretch with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the strongly demilitarised zone between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserts as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and they often repatriate them.
The relations between the north and the south (which technically continue in war) have improved significantly during the last months.
This same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to keep conversations focused on nuclear weapons removal that were parked.
This occurred after the June meeting between the U.S. president Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un held in Singapore, in which he agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, blamed sanctions imposed by the United States from the lack of progress since.
If we have no confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in these circumstances, there is no possibility that we disarm ourselves first,” said Mr Ri in a speech pronounced against the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanagh "historic" and claims that it is not appropriate to access the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Brett Kavanaugh “historic” court and said it was not appropriate for his nature to access the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview made on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't avoid thinking that if a woman behaved at any time in that way, he would call her "historical", he said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement of Kavanaugh against the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanagh denied emotionally the accusations of sexual abuse about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial declaration, Kavanagh was very excited, sometimes almost shouting and talking about himself as he described his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the democratics of the committee, cataloging accusations against him as a "skiller of the grotesque and coordinated reputation" organised by liberals under the leadership of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi declared that he believed that the declaration of Kavanaugh showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
I think that disqualified himself with these statements and with the way that he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi objected when he asked whether he would try to impeach Kavanagh if he is confirmed in the position and if the Democrats obtain the majority in the House of Representatives.
What I have to say is the following: if you are not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it is not suitable to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court in which you are currently."
Kavanaugh is currently the court of Washington D.C. Appeals Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned with possible resolutions that he could adopt Kavanaugh against the law of protection to the patient and care of the affordable health or the case Roe against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation views, Kavanagh kept questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a historical person and with prejudices to the court and yet to expect that we say, to look good!"
And women need to exercise it.
It is a justified date, months and years of fury overflowing, and can not expel it without crying.
"We cry when we become angry", I told Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's so rare, not?"
He continued to say, "I received a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said he also cried when he was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted when angered and began crying, he said to the person I was talking to: "I'm the best I'm thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry.”
And then, he continued.
I found it bright.”
tears are allowed as a escape valve for anger in part because they are not essentially understood.
One of my most beloved memories in a first office dominated by men, in which I started crying with impossible rage to describe, was that a greater woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the mouth of the stairs.
"Never allows you to see you crying", he told me.
"You don't know you're furious.
They believe that you are sad and that they will comfort you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was taken on an adventure outside the marriage in a prison race boat, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why he could not consider the idea of presenting her to the presidency.
"It was not a well-relected decision", told me about 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last they needed was another.
Someone called it "Whiteness and the Seven Dwarves".
Since the campaign was advanced, it had been carried out in the collection of funds, so it was suggested that he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He discovered that some of those who supported him contributed 1,000 dollars to male candidates would only give him $250.
"What do I think, what I have a discount?"
When he made his speech to announce that he would not present a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported him, of frustration with the system that was difficult to raise money and direct the voters instead of the delegates and of anger for the existing sex) that remained without words.
You would think he had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted with her.
"You would think that Kleenx was my sponsoring company.
I remember to think, what are they going to write in my tomb?
"Choued?"
In what mode it can turn out to be positive the commercial war between the United States and China for Beijing
Initial bombings of the U.S. war were endearing, and despite the fact that war is far from ending, a distance between countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, they claim experts.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning at the beginning of this year recording Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new rates that affect an equivalent to $ 200,000, recording half of the articles coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has recruited every time in the same way, the most recent up to ten percent tariffs on US$60.
China promised to mimic American measures and seems unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will be immunated in the short term.
To get Washington back, it would be necessary to give up his demands, but to the United States would be more shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play their letters correctly, trade war pressures with the United States could favor China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized," Abigal Grace, a researcher focused on Asia from the Center for New American Security, a centre of studies.
Syria is “list” in order for the refugees to return, says the foreign minister
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is requesting help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
" Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and safe thanks to progress achieved in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
All the conditions necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave due to terrorism and the unitary economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are now provided.
The UN calculates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people continue to live in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would thank you for the help you can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or countries that supported the uprising.
Europe gets victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Ryder Cup 2018 defeating the U.S. team by an end score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National Club located outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive defeat of the United States in European territory and has been winning a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickleson, who offered the most battle during the tournament, ordered the ball to the water in the hole 16 out of par 3, losing its game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has shined in all its series, becoming one of the only four players who achieved a 5-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the worst rank of the European team, Thorbborn Olesen, from Denmark.
The first classified in the ranking of the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, the Spaniard Sergio García became the European player with the most victories of the tournament, with 25,5 points.
"I don't usually cry often, but today I can't avoid it.
It was a hard year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting myself and believing myself.
I am so happy, so happy to recover the glass.
The important thing is the team, and I'm content to be able to help you," declared an excited García after European victory.
He spent the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of the golf Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the individual game of Sunday.
"It is incredible the proud that I feel today for being able to defeat Tiger Woods. I grew seeing playing this boy", said Rahm, of 23 years.
Woods lost its four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 on the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, 14 majors winner, located only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had problems throughout the weekend to not leave the streets except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played a high calibre golf throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk declared after the frustrating performance of his team: "I am proud of these guys, fought.
This morning for a moment put in difficulties to Europeans.
We fight.
Quito's hat before Thomas.
It is an excellent captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We will arrange, work with the PGA of America and with our Ryder Cup committee and we will go forward.
I want these 12 guys and I am proud to be captain.
It is to take out the hat.
They were superior."
