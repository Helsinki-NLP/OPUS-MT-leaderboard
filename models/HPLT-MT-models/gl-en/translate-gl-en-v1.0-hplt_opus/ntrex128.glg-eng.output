Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they are "taken by puppets".
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, now called AM, for the suggestion that they should change the name to MVP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate stemmed from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire panorama fear being the object of ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned that the new name "rhythms with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don’t know Welsh, “twp” means “stupid” and “pwp” means “caca”.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party stated that the group's set "was not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" on the change of name, but noted that from MMP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: “Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on these proposals, which showed much support for the Welsh Parliament.
With respect to the issue of AM's title, the Commission preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MVP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
It seems that AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could turn out to be a headache for President Elin Jones, of whom the bill on change is expected to deliver in a few weeks.
The law on reforms will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules of disqualification of AM and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get a final vote on what they should be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to settle a dispute that has already lasted for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who in the plebiscite opposes the change of name, said he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum proponents, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
The elders I spoke to said there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither one thing nor the other.
He said he could understand that the bars had disappeared.
People are socializing in other ways,” he said.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighbourhoods that people usually go to.
As for the churches, it fears that the money from the sale of assets does not last as long as the leaders expect, and “before or after they will return where they started.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with owners' communities filled with the type of people who would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
The vast majority of the people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will speed up the closure of all these churches, because new owners are unlikely to become members of those churches.
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, a metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 30s.
A nearby black congregation took over the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street shops, a shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and raising black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that it was the world's first carillon played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who changed it to the major carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one has taken his place in St. Martin.
Those who have been occupying St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the secular leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The parish board, the organ that governs the parish and that is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern why the latter "pretends to affect the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark bites a boy while fishing for lobsters in California
Police reported a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while fishing underwater in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with some friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, at which point he swam with a group of people to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just excitement at fishing for a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was shouting "They were working on me!
They worked!”
He had the clavicle torn." Hammel said he noticed when he came to the boy.
I'll shout to everyone who came out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic damage at the top of the torso.
Officers closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, Casablanca, to Swami's, Ecinitas, for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and also for security reasons.
Giles observed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug, and Debhams with beauty brokers similar to those of the large warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the considerable dive into the UK beauty market, which amounts to £2,800 million and continues to grow as sales fall in fashion and household products, the biggest corridors with beauty products will be tested at 11 stores throughout the country, and then they will be successful to others next year.
The investment in beauty occurs at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double its offer of beauty products to reach 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees collections will also gain more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something increasingly demanded by the younger customers.
In addition, the perfume shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon in south London last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small shops means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, stated that the establishments will increasingly look like shopping centers, as supermarket chains try to compete with retail stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's already introduced Argos and Habitat sales points in hundreds of stores, as he bought both chains two years ago. As a result, this reinforced the sales of edibles and rendered the acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues to its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold his pharmacy business made up of 281 stores for Celesius, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It has been commented that Lloyds would take part in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We transform the image of our beauty corridors to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained personnel that can be used to ask for advice.
Our range of products is designed to suit all needs and attractive and practical locations, which means that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old buying habits.
Peter Jones "furious" after Holly Willoughby retires from £11 million business
Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, left "furious" after television presenter Holly Willoughby retired from a £11 million business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for his home clothing brand and Truly accessories.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old Instagram presenter used this to say goodbye.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones sparkling his life-style record at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources state that Jones was "furious" when the girl admitted during a tense Saturday meeting at the head office of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at £1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to devote to the home clothing and accessories brand of both Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby went to Instagram to announce he was leaving Truly, Jones took a plane to Britain and headed for one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be his long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left stunned all the people who participated in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a store full of merchandise in the offices of Marlow ready to sell.
Experts believe that abandoning this Morning’s presenter is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to the considerable investment in household clothing and textiles, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin are parents of three children and have a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% share in Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter on I'm a Celebrity ITV program.
A source close to Jones stated last night that “we shouldn’t comment on your business affairs.”
A complicated conversation “and then we fall in love”
He joked that he would receive criticism on the part of the media for commenting that some would regard as “unselfishly president” and as being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up?
Trump called his voice “Telework Presenter.”
I didn’t give up anything.
Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore, which Trump saw as a major step towards denuclearising North Korea.
But the negotiations for denuclearisation stagnated.
More than three pesos after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, reported to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, that the North did not see the "corresponding response" by the United States to early North Korea's disarmament measures.
On the contrary, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump adopted a much more optimistic view of his rally speech.
Things are going well with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile testing, helping release the hostages, and bringing the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about Kim's relationship.
It's very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to get into this amphitheater, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami ravages an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds of people dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international help, so it is a challenge,” said Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear if foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be able to contribute with their assistance.
Given the constant terrors of land that support Indonesia, the country is badly prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other coasts.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life.
Traveling between many of the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been prominent in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the new disaster to occur.
President Joko Widodo's election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia's deteriorating infrastructure, and he lavished money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is affected by a large lack of funds on the final straight to re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets of Christian and Muslim bands, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a tie goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat in front of Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still being about 27 meters from Chelsea's goal goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before throwing a shot at the second stick.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced to the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling over a kepa Arrizabalaga that jumped into the air and entered the net.
He just tried to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I came close to Kante and they say a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The forward of the Blues passed the heel ball to Matthew Kovacic in that move, before turning near the medium change and entering Liverpool.
Kovacic made a wall in the middle of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and finished in the second pole with a left-handed shot that Alison Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool faced Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday, 3:00 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with the Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the national disaster management agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people would be trapped in the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press conference reported by the spokesperson of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman dies
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with white-armed wounds on John Street, and stopped a 32-year-old man suspected of murder.
The police asked that the people in the area who had seen or heard something of that step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to get in touch with anyone close to John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera on the dashboard to contact us, as they could have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the found body belongs to a nearby Birkenauhead and was found inside a property.
This morning, friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she found herself that morning.
The investigation continues while the police say they are in the process of informing the closest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have informed him that they do not allow anyone to enter or leave the building.
The man was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to return within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area is considered a crime scene.
There was a woman crying on the scene.
It doesn’t stop saying, “It’s horrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cord with another truck just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cord, guarding the apartment block.
Anyone who has information, is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, who calls 101 or anonymously contact the Crimes to the 0800 555 111 phone number citing the 247 registration of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle to "rewrite history".
Its prohibition would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical followers and Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion of "unpleasant" and of "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, stated: "It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent depiction by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of the existing opinion in the 19th century, and part of the historiography of a figure he regards as worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not that is a complete representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is clear is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also deserving of celebration and commemoration.
A Killing Pig Destroys a Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a southwest Chinese market.
Last Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by the surname, "Yuan," was found dead with a blood-sected artery near a shed in the Liupanshui market, in the province of Guizhou.
A pig farmer prepares to put the vaccine to pigs in a barn on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had apparently travelled with his cousin on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that led to another adjacent stable.
He said there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
The forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, about 250 kilos long, attacked the farmer until he killed him.
My cousin had bloody, broken legs," said the cousin, surnamed "Wu," to the Guiyang Evening News.
The recording of the security camera shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking anyone else, while the police gathered evidence on stage.
The Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, cases of pigs that attack humans have already been recorded.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm that the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of almost 300 kilos cornered a Welsh farmer against the tractor until he reached his wife and frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been devoured by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoban farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "shooter."
They're just playing.
They are like children, very curious, they do not intend to hurt.
You just have to have the necessary respect for them,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rain to the southwest of the United States.
The forecast indicates that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rains to the north of Mexico and to the southwest of the United States for the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, eastern time, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane with winds exceeding 135 km/h and was located about 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to advance north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an outlaw begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and moves east, toward the East Coast of the United States as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she begins pushing tropical moisture northwards, which will penetrate the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause sudden dangerous floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Large tropical humidity will cause precipitation approaching 50–75 l/m2 in point zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden floods with conditions in deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
We strongly advise you to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall could form cannons that could become flowing rivers, and thunderstorms will bring wind that is locally raked and dusty.
The valley will bring strong rains to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause flow of minor debris and slippery roads.
These are the first rains of the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain reaches the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness large temperature swings in the U.S. due to Arctic cooling, although the tropics will remain warm.
Sometimes this involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
There will be a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country a warm October start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is approximately 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high average temperatures for the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people saw the trial of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people have followed in six television channels the exciting testimonies of the judge appointed to the Brett Kavanaugh High Court and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 80s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and the chains interrupt their usual schedule for a last-minute Friday: a deal designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh played them while drunk and tried to get his clothes out at a high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company featured media on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other broadcasters, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble measuring people watching TV from offices.
To get an idea, it's a similar audience to a football final or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was 2nd with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure of Friday on television.
After the moderate republican's office made a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was taken up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning being booed by protesters as he tried to get into an elevator on his way to the court hearing.
He remained with his low-look for several minutes while he was reburied, televised live on CNN.
I’m here in front of you,” a woman said.
Do you think he’s telling the world the truth?
They said to him, "You have the power while there are many defenseless women."
Flake said his office made a Flake statement, before the lift was closed, adding that he would have more to say in the committee audience.
All television and cable networks broadcast live hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate to submit the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which a minority of Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
The choice of Flake had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Playing Politics’ with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “play politics” with the future of Britain and to harm national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on attacking the so-called May Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and EU should pick up tariffs on the other side was "totally absurd".
Wayde Sims killed: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect of LSU player death
The police arrested a suspect in the shooting that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU, Louisiana State University.
According to Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder.
Officials broadcast the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fighting.
The police recovered his stage glasses and claimed that it contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he was the author of the shooting that killed Wayde.
The defence reported that a $350,000 bail was imposed on it.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death is a bullet wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police's fugitive unit, the State Police's criminal laboratory, and the South University Police's neighbors for their help in securing the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for his “deligence and quest for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade stated that the team was "dropped" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
That's what we care about all the time," Wade said.
Volcano Throws Ash on Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after 183 gas and ash emissions had been detected in 24 hours.
The center was watching several thunders and tremors.
The images of social networks showed thin layers of ash in the windshields of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysical scientists have detected an increase in the volcano’s activity 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Catalan police and separatists meeting ahead of the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators met with riot police and while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of pro-parasitists masked by riot police threw eggs and dust paint that created clouds of dark dust in the streets that are often crowded with tourists.
There were also refreshments later that day with the police, who used the nets to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups that choreographed “neither forgetting nor forgiving” faced unionists who shouted “Long life to Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be treated for mild injuries received in the protest, according to the local press.
The tension continues the skin flower in the independent region one year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although it is considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, although turnout was low and those opposed to secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent confrontations.
The pro-independence groups camped all Friday night to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The event also took place but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who came to the independent demonstration with his wife, said he had no hope for Catalonia to gain independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I’ve seen my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a tight, but decisive, victory in the regional elections this December, pro-independence Catalan parties have struggled to keep momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police with her cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since last year, announced that the following year he would run for European Parliament elections.
To present myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression suffered by the Spanish government.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car hit house
Three 33, 34, and 39-year-old men were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 (summer time in Britain).
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the gridlock and the building itself was the damaged parts.
It is also possible that a beast was shot at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory.
Rising Livingston surprised Rangers leading Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise to a level after the Hibernian, in second position.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year at the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
Rangers will play the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; the head coach, Holt, still does not know the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last year.
Livingston leaves opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to get ahead long before they scored, as their control caused all sorts of problems with Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way but his cross shot did not cross the threshold of the goal; next, Alan Lithgow's shot came out by a head of Craig Halkett from the other side of the goal.
The host team agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could put the visitors at risk in the playoffs.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston made a sack in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined their efforts to secure Menga, who played the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, Rangers dominated possession but had come across an impenetrable defense that prevented much work from being done by goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop at Kelly.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's goal with his feet, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another play at Livingston's standstill ball.
Many cross-passes were produced in the Livingston area which were continuously cleared, while two penalties were rejected: one by hand and one by Halkett's entry to the Glenn Middleton replacement.
← “Feminal” by Livingston: Analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
It was a fantastic performance and a fantastic result for Livingston.
And unanimous, they have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since he returned to the top category, but some of the merit is from Holt as he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, superbly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga did not give them a respite throughout the game from Connor Goldson and Joe Worall.
Rangers are not impressed.
Despite working well at times under the orders of Gerrard, this time he did not reach that level.
The last pass failed. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. A wake-up call for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdoğan receives an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday 29 September there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to re-establish relations between NATO's allies.
They differed on many issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdoğan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a gigantic new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from meeting in front of the mosque, but many Erdoğan's supporters approached to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) have also raised their voices by condemning both Erdoğan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The duel of manifestations reflects the division before a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist killed while colliding with a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The crash took place near the crossing between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 (summer hours in Britain).
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident took place months after another cyclist died in a run-off on Childers Street a little over a half mile from the Saturday accident.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
There are street closures and buses have been diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in a high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 (summer time in Britain) on Sunday and continues.
A specialized “Tornado” unit of officers came to take care of the riots, in which eight inmates are involved in a pavilion.
The officers received attention for minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesperson said: “A highly trained prison staff was deployed to face a continuing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff had to be treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time between bars.
HMP Long Lartin hosts more than 500 prisoners, among them some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the head of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, riot officials had to go to jail to calm a revolt in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the places affected by drought could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is very likely to occur at the beginning of next week, when remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the South-West Desert leaving a chance of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued sudden flooding alerts for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service stated in a Twitter post that “only ten tropical cyclones have kept the state of depression or tropical storm in a radius of 320 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that spread over a 64-kilometer radius of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service prevent 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150l/m2 in the Mogolon Edge of Arizona.
Other areas of the South-West Desert, such as the Central Rockies and the Great Basin could reach up to 25 or 50 liters, with possible isolated totals of 100 l/m2.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa could be a blessing, as the region is greatly affected by droughts.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain may be beneficial, as the southwest is experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category,” said weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who will still have hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is heading north at 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is being encountered with cold water in the Pacific and therefore, losing strength.
For this reason, it is expected that it will land in Mexico with a tropical storm force on the afternoon or on the night of Monday.
It could rain heavily in some parts of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
Total precipitation is expected between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwest Sonora, being possible to meet up to 250 l/m2," weather.com reports.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving on the Arizona border at the first hour of Tuesday as a tropical depression and then continues to climb through Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of the night on Tuesday.
The main danger of Rosa or what is left of her are the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to sudden waterfalls and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Murder in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old boy with a white gun injury.
The teenager was found injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area on Saturday around 04:00 (summer time in Britain).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18, and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials asked for the help of anyone who had a recording on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘smitten the mess and cholera’ of the Democratic Party
Vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump declared that Kavanaugh "suffered mercy and anger" from the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that she had sexually assaulted her decades earlier, being a teenager.
Ford also testified at the trial on his charge.
The president said on Saturday that the “Americans” were witnesses to the brilliance, quality and bravery of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best jurists of our time with an imputed history of public service,” he told the crowd of admirers of West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while discussing the importance of the Republican results in the mid-term election.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t compete, but I really do,” he said.
We are all fighting for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats' mission is to "oppose and obstruct".
The first trial vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party assistant told CNN.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami kills hundreds and the number continues to grow.
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them being swept by giant waves that broke the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke into land to the slum, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Yesterday, when the threat arose, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, house, swept everything I could find,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traversed high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency show many shops and buildings destroyed, broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes took place in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) stated that the energy released by the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, settled at the tip of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “quantious” and said that thousands of home, shopping malls, and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the victims and damage could be greater along the north coast of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications were “completely paralyzed and there is no information” from Donggala, added Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In a shared amateur recording on social media, you can hear a man standing on the last floor of a building screaming frantically warning of the arrival of a tsunami to the people on the street.
In a matter of minutes the water hits the shore leading to buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that led to the cut of communications across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun shipping cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the evacuation centers of Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It is terrible.
During the journey that the World Vision staff traveled to reach the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered in raised canvas shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It is terrible.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of setting up assistance in the event of disaster, some complained that they were preventing Palu from traveling to foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience.
According to Indonesian legislation, the funds, supplies and staff allocation from abroad can only flow if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn’t happened yet.
It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we can open ourselves to international help, but that moment has not yet come.”
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, the family and friends of the missing were clinging to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that lighten the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of the house.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble of her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the paragliding paragliders missing for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Hotel were his students.
As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the demolition of the Roa hotel among the parapent community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only one gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Steal $26,750 while reloading an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker who was recharging a cashier at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
In the press release, officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier into the leisure complex and was preparing to hand over more money.
While he was busy, another man “went running from the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money he had to hand over.
According to the note, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned on stage, but the police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, please contact the Newport police department at number 859-292-3680.
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kanye West changed the name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "To be formerly known as Kanye West."
Some time ago West, 41, was known by Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change occurred before their appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they are expected to release their new album Yandhi.
She will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, who cancelled her assistance for “emotional reasons”, according to the show’s creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning to him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’, had stated that same year West while talking about his album with the radio host Big Boy.
So it's me, it's you, it's us.
I passed from Kanye, which means only Ye, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another famous rapper who changed his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, was also picked up by putting and removing the script and using the capitals.
AMO commits not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised not to use the military force again when he approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against the students.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would not use the military again to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square killing around 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico by giving monthly aid to young people studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drags young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the investment in I.A.
According to AI investor and professional Kai-Fu Lee, employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the US should double the amount that invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made advertisements about AI, even if the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its previous plan the year before: it intends to be the number 1 innovation in AI in 2030.
Double the budget in research in AI would be a good start, as the other countries are far behind than the US, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double the funding could double the odds that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent Chinese AI companies: Face++.
In the 80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat American Othello's player with the highest score and was later executive at Microsoft Research of the Google subsidiary in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology contests as the robotic challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next to help identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee says.
China is not the one who is taking the academic leaders, but the companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the US boost its efforts in AI.
I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
China’s State Council published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Center for Artificial Intelligence that is meant to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee for Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2,000 million in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research in AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation seeking to create a national security commission on artificial intelligence has not registered movement for months.
The Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they would like to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a dispute for decades with Greece that had blocked admission requests in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbours represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result will reach the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot paper of the referendum was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO, one of the countries emerging from the fall of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old in Skopje.
While not legally binding, many members of parliament said they would abide by the result of the vote and would do so permanently.
A nine-year change would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that at 1 p.m. no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters cast their vote.
I have come to vote for my children, our site is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zoran Zaev, and his son Dushko cast their vote for the referendum on the change of the country name that would pave the way for their accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the shops for those who had boycotted the referendum.
We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high and not by the service gate, Kavadarkov added.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be the confirmation of our future.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure that is below what was required.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people consulted were planning to go to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it had seized power in May of the a in the past.
See: Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the whole defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took charge of defending Brighton with 2-0 Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy to score the goal of minute 65.
The Argentinean striker received a pass in the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders before heading for the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He broke off a defense before overtaking several more on the rim of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton's Mathew Ryan's goalkeeper with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero is going through some problems in the foot," said City coach Pepiola, to reporters.
He played 55 or 60 minutes.
And that’s when it happened.
We were lucky to have it at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the blue-blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depth of the Brighton field in that move.
He sent a beautiful pass to the right side of the band to Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several hints before taking Sterling to the opposite post.
The blue-blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
The City will face the Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the struggle for self-determination, there was not much reason to force another ownership.
But an ever competitive Scherzer expects to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still significant fanbase implications for the Rockies, who take a Los Angeles Dodgers lead in the West Division of the National League.
The Rockies claimed at least one position of the wildcard with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but continue to attempt to close their first division title.
Although we don’t play anything, at least we can touch the rubber knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other team would probably play at the highest level I’ve played this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the opener on Sunday, but they seem to be bent on Scherzer being the one who throws it in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom it would be his 34th start, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will probably launch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right wing is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump is holding a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of the result in mid-term elections.
We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
That’s something big, big... I don’t compete, but I really do, and that’s why I go everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “Come to this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means necessary, evil, and mercy.
It doesn’t matter to those who do harm, over those who have to pass in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re never going to give it to them.
The mission of democrats is to oppose and obstruct.
And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "disgusted, greedy, mad, and liars."
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public acclaim.
Do you remember his response?
Have you leaked the document?
Mmmmm...oh, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer open.
It is not tolerant of those who express their views.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, the truth is that I was not too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a number of working-class MPs who are not well-received, and all for telling our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, casually issues on which Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday indicated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years that I have been working as a deputy, the Friday night meetings of the committee have been exactly like that.
Sadly, that’s no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a “more friendly and gentler policy” has long been forgotten, if it is that it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged whether all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, when colleagues with whom he believed shared a similar political vision began to hope that he would portray and adopt positions with which he would never agree, whether in terms of national security as in the EU’s single market.
When I speak publicly, and in reality a little the same as you say, there is a tremendous uproar and social media attacks by censoring the center politics, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are directed to me are usually political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues facing a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how insult levels were normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with each movement of “no confidence” or each change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the last few years I have received many advice that urge me to keep my head hidden, not to be so frank and that then “everything would be fine for me”.
But I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party there are 32 still in school, led by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and minister of government.
I have never hidden my policy, not even in the last election.
No Nottingham East member could be confused with my political views and that I disagree with the current direction of the party.
To those who promoted the Friday motion, all I would say is that while the country is walking towards a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party leader.
But in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, be members or not of the party: I am proud to serve them, and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: An Invictus Ayr is Headed
The last two attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved to win this spin-off of the Premier League.
Now they lead the table and are the only unbeaten team in the ten.
He was eventually superior to his defense, as well as taking the team to victory. coach Peter Murphy had the whole right to be happy.
So far we’ve been tested on our game and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "We must recognize that Ayr has taken on opportunities better than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot to take a wrong throw.
Climate increased the advantage for the Ayr with a penalty, before it, just in the middle of time, transformed a single shot, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a prolonged stop due to serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher and, from the restart, Ayr moved further through an essay by Stafford McDowall, transformed by Clima.
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took over from a player plus a Bruce Colvine test that was not consumed, at the end of a high-pressure period.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for plaguing Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored an assay from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's malle.
Climate marked, as it had been since the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up the launch in David Armstrong's area and sent it to third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth test from the local team.
Still Game's protagonist starts a new career in the restoration industry
Still Game star, Ford Kieran, appears to be ready to enter the catering industry after he was discovered to have been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next season would be final, and Kierman seems to plan another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, although a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
The Sea Is Ours: Internal Bolivia Expects Court to Path to the Pacific
Mariners watch a naval headquarters covered in La Paz.
The public buildings wave a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are flooded with the slogan: “The sea is ours by right.
Recovery is a duty.
In Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict remains alive, as does the desire to return to the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX judgment on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will pronounce itself in favor of the Bolivian claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outlet to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a dispute over re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said in late August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court would give Bolivia a reason, and that it would change little if that happened.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we hear indicates that the case “was not complicated”, says the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zarate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could have been delayed.
The subject of access to the sea has long been blocked by the current Bolivian administration," says Zarate.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined the good will that was left of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to keep them after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had been making an unusually swift decision.
On Monday Bolivia will have “a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile”, and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue for political purposes.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean.
Judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted by the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his nation will not proceed to nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This comment takes place at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart stagnant nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri claims it is “a utopia” that the continuing US sanctions and objections to a declaration ending the Korean War succeeds in dubbing the North.
Washington refuses to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang seriously talks about giving up an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion parades reveal the last line of giant hats that will soon be in the shops.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed on the walk a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that stunned the public with the purest Paris fashion week style.
The impossible hats filled Instagram this summer and these designers took to the gateway their most amazing creations.
The main piece of Valentinus was a gleaming buff hat adorned with a wide girdle imitating feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Among other large accessories there were snorkels, a magician hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high sewing.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with the glasses and the tube, and others a frozen freeze cone.
And if you're a fan of fashion, you're in luck.
Fashioned people predict that giant caps could reach stores.
The disproportionate hats come just after the “bomb”, the straw hat with a deck of 60 centimeters that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that is behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought to the gateway another great creation: a beach bag almost as large as the model dressed in a bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ summer 2019 collection La Riviera in the Paris fashion week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope that big beach hats and bags will arrive at stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the world’s citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain a history of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of results highlighted in the exams, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 students in all of Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools (SCIs), are striving to offer the highest level to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailored curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
But if you talk to him in his own language, he will come to your heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot depend solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Of the results of the recent exams this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
About 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Bachelor’s degree.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that make up the SCIs, show that 72% of the students obtained an honorary degree in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved a Bachelor’s degree.
This shows that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them as key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in private school programs and in all kinds of ways.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Training in 2014 found that a 17 percent lack of language knowledge is the reason employers are required to cover their vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential for preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that require languages.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a life skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to sustain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the languages of education differ by school.
Some schools focus on the most classical modern languages, while others opt for more important languages for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of their children, private schools always have a number of languages to choose from and specialists in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and teams with the skills to succeed, whatever the future may bring them.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills”.
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence for Scottish youth.
Il faut well do it.
John Edwards is Director of the Scottish Board of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James playing for the first time with the Los Angeles Lakers.
The team's head coach, Like Walton, announced that James would play the opening game of the pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
It will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted on Twitter that James would probably play a few minutes.
After the early-week training, he asked James about his plans for the pre-season of six Lakers games.
At this stage of my career I don’t need any pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump’s election events arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five planned rallies for next week, including stops in related cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pause confirmation vote for his candidate to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to gain support for the upcoming mid-term election, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when voted in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump’s Western Virginia rally live on YouTube.
Trump will likely deal with the matter of the trial held this week to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become strained over the allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior and who keeps the Senate's vote of confirmation for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections with a new momentum.
Therefore, these five rallies Trump will take next week are aimed at “dynamizing volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
Control of Congress is as important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible towards the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters that he would rather not be nominated.
Tonight's rally, held at the Wesbanco Stadium, would gather supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrissey.
It's not a good symptom for Morrissey that the president has to come to support him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a West Virginia University politician at Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows endurance to fight and keep hope alive until individual games on Sunday
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
Impulse swing pendulum is a concept in which athletes really believe in, and especially in, competitions like this.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I guess we take that as a bit of momentum," Jordan Spieth said as he walked at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in favor and a lot to cheer for, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each has three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
These guttural screams became stronger as his round progressed, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game in the 15th, he threw a similar cry, the kind of scream that he believes the American team is not yet out.
All you have to do is focus and worry about your game," said Spieth.
It’s the only thing that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but loving European couple have four and they can’t be wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple not to make a boxing on Saturday afternoon, but they were also prevented on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and not the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way it seems to flow his energy into the crowd and from it, confirms them as the rivals to beat on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to get a win when you set the sun on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Both are preferably in different locations at the same time.
However, speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A boxey and two doubles on the first trip ended up with the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help you get out of the hole.
The 4balls and 4somes are so fascinating to see closely from interactions between couples, the tips they give themselves, the ones they don’t, and the way they can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has endurance to fight, which some, especially Statesid, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the four-balls and the foursomes with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duet formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulty scoring four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who sought to preserve the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning four-balls, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning four games, but failed to cut the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four of the initial four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they perfectly matched to defeat a rogue Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4 .
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without grief or glory, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of 29 games in the four-ball and four-game and five-follow manners.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning's four-balls, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, taking a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
Europe could not always win on a nice day of breeze in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference point for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2&1 win over Spanishman John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the 4balls and again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There were only two points in the history of the Ryder Cup in which a team would score four individual points, although as the current holder of the trophy, the Furyk team only needs to be tied to preserve it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Cora says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased in the United States and that the country would not hand over its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important steps to show its good will" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing fields, and committing to proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see the appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament on our part first.
While Ri resumed the already known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, its statement seemed important, as it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to "nuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump assured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States declared that Pyongyang should first lay its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted relieving harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its goal of coercive and even oppose the "declaration of the end of war," said Ri.
The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream, for those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions sharpen our distrust.
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
However, he spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other part of this topic of denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached a dead end."
However, Ri's tone of speech was radically different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after President Trump called Kim "a rocket on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking action for disarmament, but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this, and that “no matter whether it takes two years, three or five months.”
China and Russia discuss whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council that “the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe the complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions in North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying he had made progress, only a few hours after North Korea denounced him for "massive demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the “corresponding measures”.
Kim pointed out that the "corresponding measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest long enough
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep more in order to fight the growth of the male culture of studying all night stimulated by caffeine.
An academic has found that the number one university students in the world often are unaware of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and specialist at Brigham and Woman Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
At the end of the course, a girl came up and said to me, ‘Why do you just tell me this now, in my last year?’
He said no one had talked to him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how to acquire good sleep habits with academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services at the university, stated that the university decided to present the course after discovering that students had an important lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour involves a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficit affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed of how prolonged sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what health effects we have if we choose to smoke tobacco," said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride spent the whole night awake still exists, and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students who implied lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough and that you have a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of a student to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, it points out. Even avoiding fattening, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter into the mode of starvation, which causes you to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to take a course throughout the campus.
The next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm to sleep, as well as waking up. It is also recommended that they be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may discourage circadian rhythm and cause problems for sleep.
Livingston 1–0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down the men of Gerrard
Rangers suffered another sad episode when the attack on Dolly Menga relegated Steven Gerrard's disarrayed team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox's team sought to record their first home win since the 4-1 win in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team suffered the second loss of Gerrard in 18 games as a coach, which left the team to eight points from the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break and an uninspired Rangers lineup never gave the feeling of being tied.
While the Rangers descended to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and was only behind the Hibernian with a goal of difference.
And it could have been a lot worse for Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to have treated for a head injury after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept the Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same 11 of Livingston that scored one point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way in which his set stifled his opponents at all times.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
He could have scored in just two minutes when the short passage of Menga's early time sent Scott Pittman into Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick by Keaghan Jacobs arrived at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defenseman Alan Lithgow only managed to nail him in the second pole.
Rangers have taken control, but they seem to have more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
No doubt Alfredo Morelos felt he would have had to pit penalty within 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the claims of the Colombian.
Rangers made only two knocks at the door in the first half, but Ibrox's former bodyguard Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head-end and the attack on Ovie Ejaria.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for its hard work.
Rangers again failed to cope with the strong formation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the cold blood to pick Menga for a single finish.
Gerrard acted on the break by switching to Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left-handed made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour the visitors by playing exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded its lead in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow's lead from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty for entwining with Jacobs, but Thomson again made a fat look.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and Contained ... was the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually took him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a fundamental element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring apparently unassuming cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What’s that in the world?”
Rogers: "He is a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By placing these headphones, the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals can be heard.
Evan: "He says, it's going to explode right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the defective cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer and re-inject it.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a common protein to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "improves the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to approach cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump using a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) following his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was booed in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a cap on Make America Great Again, he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I often talk to a white man and he says, "How can you like Trump if he's racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, Chris Rock uploaded the critical images from West to social media.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of his cap.
They’ve been with me on the back.
They said, ‘Don’t hang out with that hat.’
I was intimidated!
And then they said I was going to be on the verge," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see how I'm going to pick up?", saying that he would "use my superman's cap, because it means you can't tell me what to do."
Try it with love.
His comments caused audiences to yell at least twice, and the SNL cast members seemed to be embarrassed, reported Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there gave the publication: "The whole study was silent at all."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many people perplexed by an interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West obtained the support of the leader of the Conservative group TUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for facing the Mafia."
However, the host of an interview program, Karen Hunter, wrote a tweet saying West was simply "to be who he is and that's all wonderful."
However, I chose NOT to reward anyone (buying their music or clothes or supporting their “art”) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It is FREE.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the officially known being Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg got the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the music, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and, later, the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charges for attempted murder for robbery at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old has attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that those roles on the screen translate into what it seems young people often have to be tough to respect them.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that “something has failed” and asks how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era (#I too).
Kit, who recently married the co-star of 31-year-old Rose Leslie, also admitted that she feels “quite strong” to address the problem.
Personally, I feel quite strong at this point. What are we wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?
Kit believes that television can be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
Something went wrong with the kids.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields".
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, to be the best of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife on this show, so she somehow provided me with my future family and my life from here on," he said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in the land of Leslie’s family heritage in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% rise in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, the health authorities declared.
40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was practically reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, in annual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters dismisses a staff member leaking data from Republican Party Senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information to the U.S. Republican Party on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat stated that the statements were being made by "ultra-right" websites and commentators.
Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the press release, the information released included private addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, the United States government headquarters, during an audience of the Senate panel about sexual misconduct allegations against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared a little after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identifies the origin of posts was associated with the Waters Department and revealed information from a staff member of Waters, reported the Capitol Hill.
This unfounded accusation is entirely false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent accusations, has not been responsible in any way for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters' statement immediately raised criticism online, including those of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
This man was angry," wrote Fleischer.
He makes it clear that he has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something they have not done, they should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
The defendant's motives should not be questioned.
It must remain calm and peaceful.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to Judge Kavanaugh's criticism, which critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran out of Waters in mid-term elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
It’s really hard,” she shared in a tweet.
In his statement, Waters said that his department warned "the entities in charge of compliance with the law and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent charges.
We will make sure we find the culprits," he continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to each and every member of my team.
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: Back in Action), Rowan Atkinson's Unpowerful Spy Parody
It is already traditional to look for the significance of Brexit in young films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the franchise from this parody and action comedy by Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn (“Johnny English Returns”).
Will it become the ironic satire of the obvious stupid matter that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent bright-eyed and rubber-like character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that it is a general comic creation designed for non-English cinematic territories.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims of flattering glamur, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a bit of that kind that contributed a single note on the theme of "Cars of Fire" at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, in which chaos sows in its passage.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last exit.
I love when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval armour suit and the rotor blades make a brief bang against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps into view, but he gives the impression that humor has little strength and is unusually superfluous, especially when this kind of "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems as if humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's extravagant misadventures are not as witty or concentrated as Atkinson's silent-film jokes when he embodys Bean's character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cybernetic pirate infiltrates the web spy network in Britain and reveals the identities of every British agent in the area, for service distress, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character who almost looks like Theresa May, but can’t do much with the script.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as all spies were engaged in active duty, he must take someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English in person, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives extra-official classes on how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing session and meet their long-time, long-suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man with a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty’s Secret Service errands return to action, encountering the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the technological billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous mischievous: disguised as waiters, set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; they create a tumult that illegally puts them on board the luxury yacht of Volta; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to unify the interior of the Volta house.
Obviously, all arrests come out of that last sequence, but in the kind and outrageous way it is, it seems taken from a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help thinking: the British film industry can't offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they cover for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but which they cover for five.
Supposedly, the party wants employers to spend the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) to the workers offering them an additional free day.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the economic agenda of the party and its plans to tilt the country in favour of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported four-day-to-week shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A major source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits the party’s approach to balancing the worker’s economy, as well as the party’s general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party currently does not support ambition in its entirety.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day working week does not enter party politics and is not being considered by the party.”
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to bolster his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in the shadow also imply the possibility that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover all their investment, as a labour government could make "deductions" because of perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to put workers in the councils of companies and create inclusive property funds to deliver 10% of the private sector’s shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends for a value of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if FBI investigation about Kavanaugh could make them change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least one week the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court. The question of whether the Department's findings could influence the Republican senators to withdraw his support.
On Sunday, in an interview, "60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could come up with something that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
I said I would go to the audience. I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusation came out and asked if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, and resounding."
However, Graham's vote appears to be immovable.
My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is decided and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know what follows: Brett denied him emphatically," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive sign of stars that will act and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event to end poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively combating it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the audience had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But what is the level of success of the Global Citizen 12 years from achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just another case of so-called “clickism”, people who think it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, boosting a set of different goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion established to influence the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK company of investors and executioners who pledged to "help children develop to their maximum potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities, and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn social injustice from malnutrition into a page-to-page note of history,” Prime Minister Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions were carried out in favour of improving nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for the The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen said: “It will be a long and difficult path, and sometimes we will fall and fall.
But just as with the great anti-apartheid movements and the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to make a "block" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced.
If necessary, Washington may appeal to the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including that of the Middle East," said US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claims that Russia's commitment to Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the officer, they have the ways and the means to deal with it.
The United States has the ability, along with the navy, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market.
Zinke thus addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies to deal with Russia and Iran, taking into account that it is in practice the same.
The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, while referring to Russia as having “just a tactic” with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
Statements were made while Trump's administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia's, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of Trump's administration, including the President himself, intended to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "child" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which was established to double the existing pipeline’s capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin has argued that Washington's fervent opposition to the project is only argued for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the idea that energy can’t be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the providers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who took place in September in Moscow.
The U.S. stance was met with a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German organisation of the sector, the German Industry Federation (BDI), appealed to the US to move away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to examine her candidacy for president in 2020
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy to the presidency after midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the fractured government and that includes a woman in power,” said The Hill.
After the 6th of November, I will carefully examine my candidacy to the presidency.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the public assembly, stating that he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented on a tweet that "of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a poll published on Thursday, it was shown that most of Warren’s own voters do not believe it will be coming up in 2020.
Fifty percent of voters in Massachusetts said the Senator would not submit his candidacy, according to a poll from the University of Suffolk and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The survey showed more support for the candidacy of the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidate and 48 percent against.
Other notable names for Democrats in relation to a possible candidate in 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites post-traumatic stress disorder (TEPT) from track Palin at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
With what my own son is going through, with what he is going through again, I can see him reflected in other families who feel the consequences of TEP and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” Trump told the audience at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was taboo and that his son and other war veterans, "come different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for what fellow militiamen and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence report and a gun at the same time as she was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial remedy in connection with a new US policy that denies asylum to victims of domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives of 18 states and the district presented a court friend report in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff's part of Grace v. that the American Civil Liberties Union presented in August against federal policy was not revealed.
He said that his couple "and their children members of a violent criminal organization" abused him, but that U.S. officials refused his asylum application on July 20.
Arrested in Texas.
Advocates of states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration of Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be awarded according to the facts and circumstances of the application, and that prohibition infringes that principle.
The prosecutors continued to debate the report that the policy that the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "provide workforce".
In June, the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion," he said in a statement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (even serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
The circumstances are very tense," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoling her febrile baby in the evacuation center of the desolate town of Palu.
Every minute comes an ambulance with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The residents were seen returning to their homes destroyed, collecting their belongings flooded, trying to save anything they found.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
Tears filled his eyes while explaining how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save them.
The ruins of the wall have crushed me, I think,” Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
I listened to my wife asking for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of using "propaganda" ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper proclaiming the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, referred to China Daily's payment supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's top-selling newspaper, after accusing China of inferring in the U.S. Congress elections, which will be held on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's claim that Beijing was attempting to enter the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials had coined in Reuters as a new phase of a growing Washington campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught in a growing trade war witnessing the level of tariffs in their respective imports.
According to China and the US, China's compensatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters of states such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, said that Beijing harmed workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion article written by Branstad and published in the Sunday edition of the Moines Register, China has proposed that "it is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free American press."
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press when it publishes a paid ad in the Des Moines Register.
On the contrary, at the newspaper post located at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese can have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, since the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party.
He also states that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not confirm what newspaper it is about.
Kavanaugh’s disaster puts women’s republican vote down a few days from the mid-term election
While many of the leading republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the upcoming mid-term election.
Reactions to these accusations were numerous, and the majority of the Republicans were positioned to move forward with the vote.
These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's School at Syracuse University in a Sunday article in The Hill.
Reeher also claimed that the last hour of Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation was enough to calm the spirits of angry voters.
Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, as well as they won’t forget it in the near future or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, lead counsel and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, in the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, opponents, in the "Close November!" grip, protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, under the control of the Judicial Committee, decided to move ahead with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectation,” said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst.
It's already high,
But it will be even more so, especially among the undecided women voters in the neighborhoods who are between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls.
Before Ford's public testimony had detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, the analysts suggested that it was possible to suffer a violent reaction if the Republicans were to go ahead with the confirmation.
This has become a disaster for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News.
This goes beyond the committee's vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the defendants' bench or not. The problem is how the Republicans managed this and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, US Priorities' director, who helped the Democrats' election in the news channel.
However, it appears that the Americans are divided between believing in Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents either fully or probably create Ford’s testimony, compared to 35 percent supporting Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh lies during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court showed him the genitals at a university party when he studied at Yale in the 80s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project in this technology legend, is a company based in Solid, Berners-Lee’s open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that his intention is "to dominate the world".
We have to,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
Contact lists, pending task lists, calendars, music and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this a “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea of Inrupt, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a IBM-owned security firm, some developers employed to work on the project and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke to "Facebook nor Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models from one day to the next.
We don't need your permission.
In a paper published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new solid-based website."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as of the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, cleric decorated with the Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergy in the Church of England to receive the Cross of Victory during World War I received a posthumous homage in her hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later, not knowing that he was awarded the highest military decoration in the United Kingdom.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were assigned to discover a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, was the symbol of discovering this monument exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gunfire."
He later hurried to reach the line of fire and, with a "great courage," headed the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and shot down three people from the enemy's detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was assassinated by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the war was over.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which led the young band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cut the roll to MMA fans at the right time
Imagine you've been awake all night to enjoy the full show of Bellator 206, and when it gets to the best part it prevents you from doing so.
The San Jose cartel included 13 combats, six of which were major, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
But at 6 o'clock in the morning, just as Geard Moussi and Rory MacDonald were going to see the faces, the UK spectators were perplexed when Peppa Pig appeared.
Some did not impress them after having spent so many awake hours waiting to see the fight.
An amateur described the change to these children's drawings on Twitter as "a joke of very bad taste".
The state legislation ruled that this content was not appropriate by 6 a.m., and therefore had to be changed to child programming,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Marketing and Communication at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, that's it.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take into account UK viewers in future shows.
I think we can solve it when we think about repetition,” said Coker.
But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which will be Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change occurred, I began to receive many messages and not all of them were pleasant.
We were trying to solve it because we thought it was a technical mistake.
No, it was a government issue.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We will limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give the most to our fans, but we went through and
It's a lot of anger."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic jumper, claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete states that he did not realize that everyone was like him until he got to school.
Host of the first broadcast of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne explained that she began talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also shared that the fact of being a father helped him to relativeize the importance of winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of this program, is sick due to illness.
As a guest of Laverne's first program, Daley shared that he felt "less" than the rest of the people because "it wasn't socially acceptable that you liked boys and girls".
To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different is what pushed me and gave me the strength to achieve success.
I wanted to show that I was "someone" so people wouldn't feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two Olympic bronze medals, she became a notable LGBT activist and used her appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and unafraid of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "it was a surprise".
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20 years difference between them has never been a problem.
When you live so much in such a short time" (when you were only 14 years old you first participated in an Olympic Games and your father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone your age who had experienced similar heights.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth caused Daley to completely change his perspective.
If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal.
But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked of his son was tickets for London in 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
I couldn't tell you I wouldn't be here to take that first row," Daley said.
He was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that precise moment of his death, when I realized that it was not truly invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling.
The choice of the song by Heather Small is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanies her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hairs on the tip.

A low-ranking Mickelson ended up at the Ryder Cup bank this Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will beat a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must improve his technique so that it doesn’t turn out to be an unfortunate event.
Mikelson, who participated in the 12th-round biennial event, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk's decision and was unable to participate in either the 4th or the 4th on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times in the United States, the five-time champion spent the day cheering and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, even at the height of his career, at the age of 48 he did not fit in the tight Le Golf National field, where the high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced precisely British Open winner Francesco Molinari in the ninth Sunday game, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If Americans, four points below when starting 12 individual matches, start with good standing, Mickelson's performance could be completely crucial.
Furyk trusted his man, though he could not say much more.
He perfectly understood the role he played today, gave me a slap on his shoulder, passed my arm, and told me I would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
I fully believed in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think I would play two games.
I thought I'd play more, but in the end it's the way things are and so I think they should be.
Like everyone else, I want to be out there.
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could have scored the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a race that never reached the level of his individual recorder.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven losses, although Furyk claims that his presence also provides intangibles to the team.
He's a funny, sarcastic person, ingenious and likes to stick with people, he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
I like to see how well the younger players have spent it with him this week.
He’s more than a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears the demise of the advantage.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup singles can easily become an uncomfortable journey.
The Grand Danes debuted in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but ended up reaching the finish line with a minimal lead winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
You continue to think that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; as in Brookline, where we have lost, but in Valderrama we have won little," Bjorn reflected, in the photo, after seeing the promotion of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 in the Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow you have to go all over.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are on the scoreboard.
Our goal is to win this trophy, and we have to focus on it.
I won’t get tired of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.
Charming the performance of his players on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory early.
Tomorrow we face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of individual performances, and we also have to prove our worth.
It is great to be with a partner next to you when things go well, but when you face things individually, then you test to the maximum your capacity as a golfer.
That’s the message you need to convey to players, that they get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for better individual performance than his teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last day's tours, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah."
I remember each of the damn words,” he replied when asked whether he remembered Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the last day.
We have 12 major parties, but you'd like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah's.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there’s a lot of pressure in these intermediate parties.
We prepared our lineup by taking this into account and placing the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
I have decided this order because I think it covers all the way,” Bjorn explained about his selection for the individual.
Germany's New Warship Postponed Again
The youngest frigate in the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the front ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman to the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, different anti-aircraft and anti-shipping missiles, as well as occult technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and that will allow Germany to project its power abroad, will be obsolete when they come into service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "critical flaws in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the personnel needed in the former Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was discovered that the ship had an excess of dramatic weight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add improvements in the future.
The 7 thousand-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the total project price, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it already reaches the amazing amount of 3100 million euros, compared to the first 2200 million.
The problems of the youngest frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making water.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of suitable ships to deploy.
The officer states that this problem is increasing, as older vessels have been removed, but not replaced by others.
He also lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spying on the secret life of bats
A new research is being carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aimed at revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland association will follow the Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus bats, as well as the Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus bats in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to keep track of bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
An analysis of sound by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of bats and what each species is doing.
Next, a habitat map will be prepared to create a detailed image of the landscape of its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Conservation Advisor for the nature of NTS, expects the results to show that areas of habitat are more important to bats and how each of the species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of grasslands and what is the best way to keep forests for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect children and habitat loss.
Aerogenators and light bulbs also pose a risk, as well as fly glue traps, some building chemical treatments and domestic cat attacks.
Cats are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the country, is taken very seriously bats.
It has ten experts trained, who conduct surveys periodically, child inspections and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even has the only and first reservoir of Scottish bats at the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species of bat.
David Thompson, State Manager, states that this is the ideal territory for them.
In Threeave we have a large area for bats," he says.
We have old buildings, historic trees and a wonderful habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It emphasizes the importance of controlling the presence of bats before performing maintenance tasks on the property, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and are illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer at Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
There is still much to be learned about bats and, in the case of many species, we do not know how they are going to their populations.
Ronaldo rejects claims for rape and his lawyers prepare to sue for German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the allegations of rape against him false, claiming that the only thing he wants is to get to know him using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for posting these allegations.
Portugal's and Juventus's striker was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375 000 to say nothing about the incident, published Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after its release, Ronaldo, 33 years old, blocked this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
No, not a thousand times.
What has been said today is false," he said to the camera, the five-time winner of the Golden Ball.
People want to get to know me using my name.
It's normal,
They want to be famous just by saying my name, it's part of my job.
I'm a happy and respectable man," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they call “an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the privacy area” according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would request compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years".
The incident took place in June 2019, in a Las Vegas Palm Hotel and Casino suite.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga would have returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents presented in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo, after the incident, kneeled and said he was 99 percent a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents confirm that Ronaldo has both had sex consented to by both parties.
Majorga also maintains that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was terrified by the reprisals and was worried about public scaring.
A 34-year-old woman says she seeks to revoke the deal while she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: car manufacturers would leave the UK
The UK would forever regret losing its place as world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, according to business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had claimed on the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production of its Burnaston factory near Derby.
We need to come to an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that in the event that Brexit did not reach any agreement, the impact of delays on the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for manufacturing Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced over 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will witness how production stops in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of trade between Honda, BMW and Land Rover.
For example, BMW confirmed that it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of no deal in Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with every 37 minutes parts of the UK and EU suppliers arriving for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without reaching an agreement, the border could be affected and there could be delays and shortages of parts.
The company claims it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Clark states that Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future EU relations is “accurately calibrated to avoid such border controls.”
It’s essential to have a deal. And we want it to be the best deal, so enjoy the current success but also make the most of this opportunity,” he said in BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains.
Toyota could not estimate how long production would take, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce plant competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, a employee of Burnaston for 24 years and a union coordinator for Unite, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A spokesman for the government stated that they presented a clear and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House stated that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting and his under-secretary of justice Rosenstein could be delayed a week more due to the struggle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, links between Russia's assistants and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fired Deputy Attorney General or not, which would endanger Mueller’s independence, he fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, among the reports that he was about to resign.
A meeting with Trump was announced in New York City on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to say goodbye to Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to prevent a clash with the Senate court hearings at which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of inappropriate sexual behavior, were also witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared in Fox News Sunday.
To answer the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is not yet a fixed date, it could be this week or it will be delayed another week, given everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like the press.”
Some journalists have questioned this claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since 10 September.
When the presenter Chris Wallace asked him the reason,
Sanders stated that the lack of an informative session was not due to a dislike for the grandeuquence of the reporters, although he added that it will not be she who denies that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press increased.
The president concedes more interviews than the previous president,” he said, although he did not cite any sources supporting the data.
Sanders said: “If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that’s much better than addressing questions to him.
You are witnesses of how we have been doing this for the past few weeks, and this will replace a press conference in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open press meetings with visiting dignitaries.
However, there are very few press conferences.
Perhaps the president has shown the reason this week in New York, with a rare appearance before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Secretary of Health to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Secretary of Health addressed a letter to EU workers in the Scottish NHS expressing gratitude for the country and conveys their desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has pledged to cover the cost of EU-covered status requests for citizens working in their decentralized public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, UK-EU negotiations on leaving continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this autumn.
However, the UK government, on the other hand, has also stepped up its preparations for a potential “no-deal” scenario.
I know this is a time of concern for everyone.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the members of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The partners of the European Union and beyond provide an unquestioned experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.
Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's defeat (31-27) against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tennessee reported.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, reported to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Apparently, he fainted as he reached the band line.
The trainers and medical personnel gave him oxygen on the band line before taking him on the stretcher to perform a later evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician reported to Chris Harris, a WSMV journalist in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when this injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year Red T-shirt student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total entries on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 of the season.
A bell tax will be applied to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher ring tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help people homeless under the new conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in the timbre tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher ring tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more accessible homes and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in the timbre tax will apply to people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the Government’s campaign to reduce the number of people who sleep on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current timbre tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second homes and the purchases to rent, may be up to 3%.
The agency expects the change to raise up to £120 million per year.
Around 13% of new London buildings are bought by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it difficult for people who want to buy a home for the first time have more difficulties accessing the real estate market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "phantom cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy applies just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for the application of a landfill tax cut to help young people acquire their first home.
She accused large builders of maintaining high house prices by buying land and not using it, and urged May to remove the percentages of tax revenues from low-priced houses to fix the "shame of the housing sector" that is being lived in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of housing-related reforms, including the control of rents and the prohibition of evictions in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give the municipalities greater powers when building new homes.
Mrs May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restore the British dream: that life should be better for every new generation.
And for that, we need to fix the housing market.
Britain will always be open to what you want to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is just as simple for those people who do not live in the UK, as for companies based abroad, to buy homes than for British workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of having a roof remains too real.
Jack Ross: “My last ambition is to train Scotland.”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross stated that his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's national coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northwest club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
When I was a player my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in the B team, and that was all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound program.
I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times when I was a kid, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in leading a club.”
Ross' background in Sunderland's head coach included Dick Advocat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager stated that he did not feel any concern about succeeding such established figures in a club after having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success for me depends at this time on if I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the club’s structure and facilities are undoubtedly owned by a Premier League club,” he said.
It’s not going to be an easy task to get there, but you’re probably just thinking I’ve achieved success here if I can get the club back to the Premier.
Ross has only been training for three years after an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period within the technical staff of Hearts.
In that period he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St Mirren from being close to winning the championship title the following season.
Ross claims to be more comfortable now than he ever found himself during his playing career at the Clyde, the Hartlepool, the Falkirk, the St Mirren, and the Academic Hamilton.
I was probably at a real crossroads," he recalled, about taking over Alloa.
I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because it didn’t go wrong, I’ve reasonably won the life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I continue to suffer from stress and work pressure, but I like to train.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a picture is 17:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave increased consumption in the British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced 2.7 percent growth during July, but restaurant consumption dropped 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's commercial advisory board, said: "The sunny days and the permanence of England in the world football for longer than expected caused July to show a similar pattern to the month of June, in which pubs enjoyed an increase of 2.8 percent in consumption, although restaurants suffered an even greater punishment.
The 1.8 percent drop in the turnover of restaurants during June worsened during July.
The pubs and bars specialized in drinks were the best results obtained with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
The pubs specialized in meals also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It feels like people just want to drink.
In the pubs and bars controlled the consumption of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the consumption of food dropped by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM employee of leisure and hospitality activities analysis, said: “These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been occurring since late April.
The time and impact of the main social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in the related consumption outside the home.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be particularly painful if the continued increase in costs is added to it.
The warm and long summer could not have come at a worse time for restoration businesses and the time will be in charge of telling whether the moderation of the temperatures experienced during August will provide the necessary respite for the sector.
The total growth of sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent during July, which reflects the slowdown in brand releases.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry sales indicator from the pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a set profit of more than 9,000 million pounds and is considered the sector’s benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide their parents.
One in five children (some 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that hide their parents and teachers according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "Insta false" pages.
This news has caused an increase in the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students have signed up for a “major” account to show their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) are creating accounts on social media that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth in the number of “Insta fake” accounts (referring to the social photo sharing network Instagram).
This news has led to an increase in fear of sexual content publishing.
Twenty percent of the students said they used a "main" soft account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found a teenager asking her to be "violated".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headstresses (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
The head of the HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is alarming that there are so many teenagers trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish athletics federation council
Eilid Doyle was elected to the council of the Scottish Athletics Federation as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most well-known Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from their broad international experience over the last decade.
Eilidh enjoys enormous respect within the Scottish community, the United Kingdom, and worldwide, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will greatly benefit from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to becoming a spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic golds and who currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transitional ischemic attack that prevented him from walking.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered an apoplexy.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thanks for the encouragement.”
An advertisement for a maternal milk extractor comparing women to cows divides public opinion on the nets
A company of maternal milk extractors has divided public opinion on the nets with an advertisement that compares lactating mothers with cows that are being milked.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed “the world’s first silent portable breast milk extractor”, Elvie has published an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the new freedom offered by the milk extractor to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in an ugly barn to the cows at the rate of a song with letters like: "Yes, it has moved me to myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed it, it's not an udder, it's my breasts."
The chorus goes on: "Muxe, muxe, am feeding babies, muxe, muxe, am milking my friends."
However, the announcement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, provoked controversy in the networks.
With 77,000 reproductions and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among the viewers. Many of them stated that it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case we rob their children days after giving birth,” she wrote.
The milk extracter Elvie can be placed discreetly inside a maternal bra (Elvie/mother)
Another observer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who stay with their babies?”
Another spectator added the following: "What an announcement with so little touch."
Other viewers defended the announcement, even one woman stated that the song seemed to him "very funny".
I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
Taking out my milk made me feel like a cow.
The announcement is a little silly, but I interpreted it as a joke.
It looks like a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement directed at mothers extracting their milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and they feel like "cows".
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, this group of women revealed that they have been dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their submitters.
The concept on which the campaign is based is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Milk Extractor is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal holder, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, mother's partner and creative director, commented: "The Elvie extractor is such a revolutionary product that deserves a daring and provocative launch.
In describing the existing parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges at the same time that we demonstrated in an entertaining and close way the incredible feeling of freedom offered by the new extractor.
This is not the first time that the Elvie extractor has taken up the headlines of the newspapers.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two creatures paraded on the walk for the designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of crossings of the border has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult for children to assign godfathers.
Traditionally, most godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid of endangering their ability to stay in the country taking a step forward to reclaim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the potential patrons and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that such data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Control Service officer, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who sought to smuggle minors without company.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have criminal records.
About 80% of the people who are godparents or who are part of their home are found in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that will require some of these to appear in court before a month has elapsed since their arrest instead of 60 days, which was the previous norm, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear by way of viewing instead of in person to try to legalize their case against an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer they stay in custody, the more likely they will be to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent takeovers or escape attempts according to the shelter workers and system reports published over the past few months.
Lawyers have stated that these fears increase in centers of greater size such as Tornillo, where there are more chances that a child is going wrong due to its size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them from the emotional point of view or to say goodbye to friends could mean a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria Calls on US, French and Turkish Occupation Forces to Withdraw Immediately
Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is currently in its eighth year.
Moulem, who also holds the position of Deputy Prime Minister, declared that foreign forces were in illegal Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "take care of them in a timely manner".
They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he told the assembly.
Moulem insisted that the “war on terrorism almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also stated that Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “of all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem stated that the conditions for his return were given and blamed "some Western countries" for the "irridical fear spread" that caused the refugees not to return.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing what should be just a humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union warned that they would not offer any assistance to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomats claim that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadline" and expressed its hope that military actions would target jihadists, including al-Nusra front soldiers linked to al-Qaeda, who will be "eradicated".
The UN envoy Staffan de Misturas hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moulem set out the conditions to ensure the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the body's work should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against possible interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
Under this logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals will be waiting for, impeachment and scandals put an end to his presidency prematurely.
The most dramatic ending of a presidency
There are currently no signs of fatigue among observers.
Since 2014, premium audience rates have increased by more than two, to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News had an average of 2.4 million viewers per prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million over four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel's audience ratings with 3.5 million viewers during the nights when important news broke.
It's like a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor," which is about a minister's cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a comic writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
He answered, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There’s entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that emerge from Washington can determine the future of the Roe case against Wade, if migrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it involves something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spending six hours watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-styling jacket ("a proud garment"), and the implications of stormy Daniels's rough descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I will never look at Mario again.
Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it’s giving you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” a space that deals with the changes in the characters and daily storyline twists of the Trump show (the conflict with the N.F.L., the praises of Kim Jong-un...).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, he made a sun and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house, on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was not able to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to confront the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court pending a thread.
I remember when we were doing all these crazy programs at the time and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money comes in piles to fund candidates to the House for mid-legislature elections
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvanian congress district is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a conference district with two representatives on duty in the race to occupy the same position.
This district located on the outskirts of Pittsburgh that has recently been reorganized is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who got his place in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is cast against another acting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined in January that Republicans had manipulated the constituency of older districts in their favor.
The electoral career in the new 17th Congressional District triggered a campaign funding festival between the main financial arms of the parties, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a tight victory in the March special election for the 18th Pennsylvania congress district, which enjoyed extensive follow-up.
That position was filled by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political experts grant Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support to China and then backed off.
The diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a nice meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials from the State Department decided to return to the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "for the recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department spokesman in a statement made this month.
However, only the possibility of applying sanctions against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, has been discussed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration from people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to advance, effectively ending any possibility of applying sanctions to El Salvador.
It is scheduled that Vice President Mike Pence will direct the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, on a symptom of the importance of the administration, said the diplomats.
The three Americans returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who accepted to talk about internal deliberations as long as the anonymity of the participants remained.
Their accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was preserved.
Studying History
The next negative case could be the report of special adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction to Mr. Trump’s justice case, of which there is abundant evidence in the public archive.
Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out if Mr. Trump’s campaign has conspired with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just when it has to be prepared for the elections, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, just like that of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to give a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at this time.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller’s fate?
Rosenstein has been taking the water to the neck since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the information in The Times is not true.
How will we respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the B.I. on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or is not impartial or if its appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-legislative elections for a Congress that requires responsibilities to Mr. Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my house, which was the seat of the embassy.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and, 60 years later, sent me to put Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw made in Spain against Villarreal this month, would put them in a very favourable position to qualify in the G group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline to achieve more important things.
It was a good point for us, as the Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
We went into the game believing we could get something positive and we got a point.
We had the chance to win at the end, but in general, the tie is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were superior.
Next year is going to be another big night.
We hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be difficult, because they have achieved a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I am sure that we can fight to achieve a positive result.
Last year was hard between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes made to the team, but there is an excellent environment at this time.
The team is good, the boys are doing well and the trainings are good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget last season and succeed.
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey were clear how they wanted them to be cared for, few people spoke with their family about the matter.
About half of participants in this study by Nationwide said they commented on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
People want to be cared for by a family member, but they’re not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the following.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family so they can take care of you if you don’t tell them your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your adviser and your family to agree where and how to receive care, since these decisions can be a determining factor when determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Prolonged care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance covered with your own funds, provided you have the money.
Negotiating your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to designate a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also worth the possibility of signing a notary power to manage your finances.
You must choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure that your invoices are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your older father or mother has a medical emergency and goes on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in a written plan to be ready.
Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors that care for it?" asked Martin.
What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?

The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police are looking for possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that affected the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the death of at least 384 people, a figure expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cut of communications, rescue bodies were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees of magnitude.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Below we provide some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the Central Celebes province, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a resort located over 300 km of coastline northwest of Celebes island.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, off the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years by Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also affected the western part of Donggala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire with high seismic activity, so it regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: An important earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh of Indonesia, on the northern Sumatra, which occurred on 26 December, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit the Mentawai Islands, located in front of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the death of approximately 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the Pidie Jaya regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people died from the fall of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, which killed more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily removed.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence allegations
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, preventing the presentation of a domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note issued by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took off his phone.
Palin remains in preventive detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he declared himself "not guilty, of course" when asked, reported the chain.
Palin faces three minor A-type crimes, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a minor B crime, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been arrested.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Court of War.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, preventing the presentation of a domestic violence and possession of weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress syndrome she suffered from after serving with the military in Iraq.
An earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has killed hundreds of people.
At least 384 people were killed after the earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not available, and the balance of the dead is expected to increase as days go by.
The earthquake occurred just in front of the Central Sulawesi in northeastern Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks showing the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few times death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are trying to apply the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that caused the death of eight people, a penalty that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on West Side Highway Avenue in Lower Manhattan, tracking the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has killed eight victims and caused serious "instantly" injuries, according to notification of the death penalty intention presented in the South District of New York.
Both offences involve the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the document of the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight murder offences in collaboration with an organized crime group, usually used by organized crime prosecutors, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation", according to the prosecutors, in describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibullaević Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" as indicated in the notification of intent to prosecution.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago, the South District of New York did not face a death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of regret during the days and months following the attack according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on his phone according to the accusation.
He also asked to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys charged with representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea with no possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all involved people,” said Patton.
The Saipov defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians had to “feel the pressure” of eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May’s own parliaments suggested that it should handle EU negotiations.
Ordinary MP Peter Bone said that the UK would "have left" the EU if Mr. Farage had been the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge faced by Ms May to reconcile the split ranks of her party was evidenced by joining the Tories in favour of staying in the EU for an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain the commitments of his Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit, on the contrary and on the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to achieve an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been told to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If I had given it to him in office, we would have been out of the EU at the moment,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must abort Chequers’ plan.”
He said: “We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone denied suggestions stating that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
A member of the Tories and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins has also been on the march, from which she told reporters: "The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy popularity among the public opinion, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones occupying the streets and allowing us to be elected.
Cancel the checkers plan and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage stated in the rally that it is necessary to "feel uncomfortable" politicians if they intend to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to betray the Brexit decision and here we’re meeting today to tell them we won’t let them go with theirs.
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
We are mobilizing the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous UK.
In the meantime, supporters of remaining in the EU made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour stand in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the message Tories Against Brexit (Tories vs Brexit) after the group launched this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered in an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
This is the people who tell us they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a no-frills border, to enjoy free market without borders in Ireland.
It's an absolute farce.
Brexit does not exist,” he said.
Warren seriously plans to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that she will consider her candidacy to the presidency after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday during a municipal session in a town in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is due to run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been the focus of speculations that make it Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the format of the city council since Trump assumed the presidency.
An assistant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for this, a woman is needed in the chair of the presidency.
An arrest was made related to the deadly shooting of Sims, the LSU player.
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 EST.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help identifying a man in the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in the head and eventually died as a result of it," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through 247 sports.
Wayde turned to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present on the scene with a gun and admitted shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed under custody in the police department of East Baton Rouge Parish.
Sims, a 2 meter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 properties last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes to the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to take victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, starting from pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton only as he defended his position during the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel pitted first and let Hamilton run with traffic on the back of the group, which would be decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the inside reluctantly at risk of being left behind after a dual defensive manoeuvre at the third corner.
Max Verstappen departed from the last row of the grid and went back up to seventh at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to retaining his tyres to get faster in the final part and ahead of Kimi Räikkönen for fourth position.
He finally pitted on lap 44 but failed to advance any position in the final eight laps, which ended with Räikkönen in fourth.
It was a difficult day, because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and he was a true gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
The wrong body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for his insistence that he had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In an act in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "miserable, repugnant, and lying."
The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful that is happening in the last days of the Senate, when one sees the indignation, when one sees that people who are angry and miserable, repugnant and lying," he said.
When you see these posts and leaks and they say, “Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t go.”
Remembered?
Did Dianne Feinstein have a leak?
Remember your answer... you leaked the document? "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I did not go.
Wait a moment.
No, no," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak coming from his office.
I have not hidden the accusations of Dr. Ford, I have not leaked its history," Feinstein told the committee as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to maintain his confidentiality and I did what he asked for.
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented the following during the Saturday night act: "I tell you that body language was not appropriate.
I may not have filtered it, but I used the worst body language I've ever seen in my life.
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and repugnant, they don’t care who they harm, who they have to beat to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars saw defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants winning the game back by 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants achieved an early lead by two goals Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for the men of Adam Keefe, who managed to go back to win the Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three previous victories for the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to a help from Kendall McFaull, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvilier after assistance from David Rutherford.
In a agitated early period, Sullivan once again put the local team in the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the tie goal at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants advanced on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance into Dundee for the first time at the end of the second period and secured victory by his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies in order to ensure that hundreds of passengers on an aircraft can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller considered a hero after he died in order to ensure that a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The balance of the dead is 800 and there are many missing after a large earthquake shook Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to feel in the area and there are many people who are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his co-workers fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said it was possible that this decision would save hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We have prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take you to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
Break your heart when you know it,” he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll may be thousands, and the country's disaster management agency has stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The balance of victims is believed to continue to increase because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
People are looting the mini-markets.
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia has suffered earthquakes this year in Lombok in which more than 550 people have died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a missing after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific at Micronesia now claims that there is a missing aircraft having previously been claimed by 47 passengers and crew to have left without incident the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline reported that it was working together with the authorities, hospitals, and local investigators to try to locate this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Ships from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the crash while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
Both the carrier and United States Navy confirmed that the aircraft had landed at the lagoon before landing.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft had gone from the runway to the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. citizen, commented that he came in very low.
That’s a good thing,” Jayne said.
Jaynes said both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water reaching the waist until the aircraft's emergency exits were sinking.
He also recalled that flight attendants were shouting and frightened, and that he suffered a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy indicated that sailors who were working near the site in the improvement efforts of a dock also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the aircraft sank approximately 30 metres (330 ft).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
An analyst composes the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution was sent to the test on Saturday in a man's trial for burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial, he described how he used the records of a cell phone to commemorate the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers' victim, on the night of his death.
Rowlett stated that he received data from the location of several mobile phones demonstrating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier claims as reported by The Clarion Ledger.
When these data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stadium on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
Cell phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that a time after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted the messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his phone.
It’s a life of his own,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be seen by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A trio of hip hop wants to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group in Bristol, claims that hip hop has strayed from its origins with political and social messages.
They want to get back to their roots and get the combative hip hop back to being popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through acts such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York City Child Caregiver Claims A Couple After A “Racist” Message
A New York City childcare company will sue a couple for dismissal after receiving a message that would not be addressed to her from the mother complaining that she was "another black".
The couple denies being racist and compares the demand with a “extortion”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was distressed to discover that Giselle Maurice was black when her first day of work was presented in 2016.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON OTHER BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing his mistake, an "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Mrs. Maurice, stating that the nurse who had just left, who was African-American, had failed his job and expected a Filipino to be in agreement with the New York Post's announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her work day and sent her home on an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands a $350 a day compensation for the six months of internal work for which he had initially been contracted, although there was no contract for it.
Look, I want to show you that these things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later “It’s a case of discrimination.
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by saying that he was fired on Maurice, because they were afraid they would not be able to trust him after offending him.
My wife had sent me a message that I had no intention of sending.
It's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Has your baby just been born?
Come on!"
After comparing demand to "extortion," Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going for someone like that?
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social networks, attacking them for their behavior and for the logic applied.
Paddington's editors fear that readers will not identify with a talking bear as it may be concluded in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It is difficult to get into the skin of a person who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's really fun to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success.
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book on a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility of his work being rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "grossing" after his death last year.
From Paddington, to what he describes as a "very important member of our family", he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he eventually achieved.
He was a quiet man and not a presumptuous one,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you had a son who gets something: you're proud even if you didn't really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave all the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, his daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that he was too bad, that he was not expected to survive.
Then I got the call from Nad to tell me I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that doctors had given him for his heart to continue beating were slowly consuming and leaving his body.
He died a few days ago and was now running out.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, at the time of mourning for the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without noticing the ordeal she was suffering.
No one noticed it," he said.
I had my head down and tears fell at all times.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.
Postcards of women afflicted to avoid suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers they can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis's son, was 13, when she began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want anyone to feel like I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile shone on every room.
However, he left the job before he died and was "in a very deep depression".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I have a continuing concern that there will be a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can come to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
Don’t be silent, you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs Davies's friend for years, has lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
I didn’t say I was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in our attitude.
Christmas Day touched the bottom (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything).
He claimed that his death was a tremendous trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He teared the family apart.
Discarded.
But we have to keep going and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a wire as the FBI begins the investigation
I thought, if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it is possible that we could get a little bit of unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "blowing" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to do the research?
Its reluctance is due to a question of deadlines.
There are five weeks left for the mid-legislative elections (6 November). If, as expected, the Republicans get bad results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to choose for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently holds 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's rule
The number of deserters in North Korea destined for South Korea has decreased from Kim Jong Un's access to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Byeong-seug Park, citing data from the South Korean unification ministry, claimed that 1,127 deserts had occurred during the past year, far from 2.706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the rise of tariffs charged by individuals charged to pass people across the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters are finally offered citizenship to South Korea.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flee through China, which has the largest border area with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South (which are technically still at war) have improved significantly over the last few months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the nuclear weapons withdrawal negotiations that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Kim Jong-un, in which they agreed to work hard to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress ever since.
If we have no confidence in the United States, we cannot rely on our national security, and under those circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm at first," Mr. Ri said in a speech delivered to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and claims he is not fit to join the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "histric" and ensured that he was not fit by his nature to enter the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman ever behaved like this, she would call her hysterical,” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual abuse by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and staying if he spoke while describing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, cataloging the charges against him as a "gross and coordinated reputation murder" organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not accede to the Supreme Court because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against Democrats.
I think he displeased himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked whether he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in the post and whether the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives.
What I have to say is this: if you are not telling the Congress or the FBI then you are not fit to stand not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where you are currently," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the law of protection and care of the accessible health or of the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation views, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would cancel certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the court and even above expect us to say, “Look, that’s right!” said Pelosi.
Women need to exercise.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and you can not expel it without crying.
We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think it's so weird, right?
He continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but who developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person with whom she was talking, 'At best you're thinking I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It looked bright.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve to anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my sharpest memories in one of my earliest works in an office dominated by men, in which I began to weep with an impossible rage to describe, was that an elderly woman grabbed me from the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and led me to the hollow of the ladder.
Never let them see you cry," he said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you are sad and they will comfort you if they come to you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an adventure out of marriage on a boat named Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
It was not a well-thought-out decision," I said among laughs 30 years later.
There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called him “White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because the campaign was advanced, it was slow to raise funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of those who supported him contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When he made his speech to announce that he would not run a formal campaign, he was overcome by the emotions (with gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address voters rather than the delegates and angered by the existing sexism) that ran out of words.
You’d think she had suffered a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled on how the press reacted to her.
You would think Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my pen?
Crying?
How the trade war between the US and China could be good for Beijing
The initial bombings of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the war is far from over, distancing between countries can be beneficial to long-term Beijing.
US President Donald Trump has issued the first warning earlier this year that China’s key exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum, are being exported.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with the application of new tariffs affecting an equivalent of $200 million, recording half of the articles that come to the United States from China.
Beijing counterattacked at the same time, with tariffs rising from five to ten percent at $60,000 million in American products.
China has promised to mimic US measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will move in the short term.
To get Washington to step back, it would be necessary to yield to his demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far more shameful to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Even so, experts say that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the trade war pressures with the United States could favor China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the necessary conditions to start an economic crisis in the two countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused researcher at the Center for New American Security, a study center.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria claims it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All the conditions necessary for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their livelihoods are now met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
More than six million people are still living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team by a score of 16.5–10.5 at the Le Golf National club outside Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in European territory and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the most offered battle during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in hole 16 of par 3, losing its game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has brightened in all his series, becoming one of only four players to have achieved a 5-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the European team's worst qualifying player, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's first ranked finisher, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European player with the most wins in the tournament, with 25.5 points.
I don’t often cry, but I can’t help it today.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I am so happy, so happy to be able to win the cup.
The important thing is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat the American legend of Tiger Woods by 2&1 in the individual Sunday game.
It's amazing how proud I am today to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I grew up watching that guy play," Rahm said.
Woods lost his four games in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
It is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, the 14-major winner, located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend not to leave the streets, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk stated after the frustrating performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We fight.
Take the hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I want these 12 guys and I’m proud to be captain.
It is to take out the hat.
They were superior.”
Red Tide Information: Concentrations are shrinking in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Wildlife and Fisheries Conservation Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, increasingly unequal outcrop conditions are being observed in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which may mean that concentrations are shrinking.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from northern Pinellas counties to southern Lee.
It can be found 16 km away from the Hillsborough count, but in fewer places compared to last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
Middle-level concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County were reported last week, background and high off the Hillsborough County coast, background and high near or near the Sarasota count coast, background and mid-level concentrations in Charlotte County, background and high off or off the coast with Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties, it is reported that cases of respiratory irritation continue.
No such case has been reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
