Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on your car dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile the motorist drives and transmits that information to the authorities, has now become a contentious issue for Washington and the State Planning Office to restore the outdated system to finance major U.S. roads.
In general, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of abrupt intense debate and vibrant alliances.
Keep details of the miles you drive, and possibly the location you drive - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - have teamed up with Libertarian environmental groups to raise support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is horrifying.
The American Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned with raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can get into a system in which the driver pays for every mile he decides on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a really essential thing for our country.
This is not a matter of choosing or not to be chosen by us" says Hassan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, who plans to start tracking every mile decided by motorists in California by the year 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes by U.S. citizens on gas pumps.
American people no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now in a gallon of gas the car runs more miles than ever before.
Federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Politicians refrain from raising even a penny in tax due to high gas prices.
The gas tax is absolutely not sustainable," says Lee Munich, transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
It will serve as the most rational option in the long run," he says.
Vonx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea seems good to urban liberals, as it can, for example, change taxes to change the way cars run, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Schuster (PA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by the driver.
It's not just a tax that's going into the blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who in their report in 2011 were pleased to move towards a per-mile payment from Congress.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural law-makers, who were representing individuals who had to walk a lot of miles daily to go to work or to the city, the House leadership ended that resolution there.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving in this direction.
It has the most inclined Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers shortly ago, the driver was very impatient to think that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says, "The concern about Big Brother and other similar things was a major problem."
This is not what people wanted.
As the test progressed, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert these devices to a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology infrastructure that must be disseminated to keep a record of every person's daily commute.
Nevada is one of the many states that is making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details on how many miles a day the car is running, but not where and at what time it is running.
If you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called TrueMile.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, with drivers having to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing is good for highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modems at certain time intervals.
If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more inclined to adopt this approach," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very few expensive and less interventional ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or again choose not to take any devices, but rather choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles decided by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience than less in the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, provide "payments according to its drive" insurance, and create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists will be able to use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, "motor-drivers will be attracted to participation due to the benefits it derives from."
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion on payments by miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund very easily by increasing the gas tax.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars may also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas so that they pay their fair share.
Randy Rentscheler, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs, said, "What exactly surgery is needed for when aspirin can work."
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died of drowning.
However, his friend has been taken into custody by the police on charges of hiding the belongings of the deceased near him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Darya.
His family had accused his friends of killing him as his mobile and other belongings were missing.
The police said the phone and SIM of the deceased were checked and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
During interrogation, the woman said that she was given the phone by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhail had gone to Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the edge, while Ruhail walked to the other side to smoke.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail searched for Zahid, but he did not find him.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and kept them for his own use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid was drowned.
Police told the court that Zahid's death was due to drowning and it was also confirmed in the post-mortem.
However, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 to hide facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, has married a 28-year-old girl in a highly secretive manner.
This was revealed by his family friend, Martel Polanco.
According to him, three-time prime minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisco Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
It is here that Francisca, whose relationship was being said that his relationship with Balrusconi is merely a showdown.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Martel Polanco has revealed that she was also invited to this intelligence marriage.
The event took place three weeks ago.
When asked what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public event.
The wedding took place at the private chapel in the former prime minister's house.
Nothing else can be said.
She, however, did not attend the wedding.
He has sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a 50-year-old woman was engaged to Francesca Pascal.
To avoid gritty, Berlusconi had based loneliness on his decision.
Even in low-lying areas, rain continued intermittently between the sun's eyes.
With this, the cold wave has started in the entire plaintiff.
The cold can be gauged from the fact that the minimum temperature has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, minus -0.2 degrees in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
Meanwhile, the Srinagar-Leh National Highway, which is strategically important due to rain and snow, has been closed for traffic.
There is heavy snow on the jojila pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of western disturbance, the snowfall in the upper reaches of the valley and rain in the lower areas started in the early hours of the day, which continued till late evening.
Normal life was also affected by the cold.
People stayed in their homes to avoid the cold.
Meanwhile, power supply was also disrupted in many areas.
Srinagar's maximum temperature of the day was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal.
At the same time, in Jammu too, due to heavy rain in the early morning, the cold has increased during the night.
Jammu recorded a minimum temperature of 16.6 and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of western disturbances has started to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotus, director of the Srinagar-based Meteorological Department, the weather in the valley is likely to remain dry from November 1 to November 7.
Jailed on charges of sexual harassment, Asaram was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being projected as a children's blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected his demand for a ban on media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop running the news about Asaram, saying he has seen every word reported in the media and sees no reason to interfere with it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had more options.
Earlier too, the court had rejected the demand for a ban on media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest ever TDS evasion case.
The group operator of the mall paid to the concerned financial institutions by deducting TDS, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing this, the TDS money was deposited with itself.
The group was teamed up with the Jaipur exploration team who came from Mumbai on October 17.
In the investigation of this link, it was revealed that this trader has deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, raids and surveys were conducted on the group of mall operators.
The businessman, angry with the action, has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not yet ready to pay TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them.
Officials investigating the case have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Due to Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of poor and fake mawa increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration Department has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized a spoon of 70 thousand from Mawa and 5 thousand from Quetta Colony, which came from Madhya Pradesh.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for poor mawa from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information about the poor mawa kept in dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The consignment of Mave is being imported from Transport Garage at Nagpur.
The department took possession of the mawa, the price of which was reported to be Rs 70 thousand.
The fear of action did not give any right to Mave.
The department destroyed it as an unclaimed property.
The department raided Jeetendra caterers in Quetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand glasses.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to glow and last for a long time.
A sample will be sent to the laboratory.
Joint Commissioner of the department, S.S. Deshmukh said that the operation of the arrest of chemical sweets and substandard and fake mawas will continue.
In the next few days, this campaign and speeding up has been informed by the department.
The consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make sweets with good milk, mave.
The department has appealed to the people to be careful with fake sweets and mawa.
He was received by 42 senior BJP leaders at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a console visit organised by the BJP.
The Sansthan Yatra is an attempt by the BJP to heal the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
A total of seven blasts took place in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists, who were involved in the blasts, had been trying to create a stampede during the rally, so that more people were killed and an atmosphere of panic was created in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the explosions.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The leaders of the party have left their village on a tour on Thursday with their ashes and urn.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will flow together in the Ganges in Patna.
As part of this journey, a consolation visit is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday.
During this visit, he will also provide a cheque of five rupees each to the families of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
Buoyed by the thumping victory in the last match, the Indian team will aim to win the series with a win when they take on Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
In order to stay in the series after two consecutive ODI matches were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case and its batsmen gave him a record-breaking performance, which led to a 2-2 draw in the series.
Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and even the biggest goal is proving to be a dwarf in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have great expectations for the team.
As far as openings are concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got such an opening pair which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat a chance to play without any pressure while making a brilliant partnership in the opening.
The Virat Kohli's performance so far is considered to be the Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
But many cricket pundits have called him better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to be 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16.
Chasing the target, he averages above 80.00 and has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive reliance on these three can also be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline' for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performances.
He is also seeking to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling in Australia can be overwhelming.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this demonstrable peace.
Referring to reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing for the infiltration of close to 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let there be peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more desperate after the separatists' attempts to instigate people in Kashmir to worsen the situation on a large scale.
Referring to the separatists' visit to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir-ul-Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chief Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given air in 2014.
Pakistan is trying to fulfill this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers at the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
In such a situation, terming the demand for the abolition of military privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that such things are also anti-people until there is a permanent peace in the state.
They give strength to the anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements of leaders that undermine the morale of the army and security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snow Den, the US intelligence informer, has declared that the German parliament is ready to travel to Berlin to testify if the US national security agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to answer about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle, met in Russia on Mr. Snowden's Thursday, where he has been given asylum, to talk about testimony in Germany.
In a letter submitted by Mr Snowden to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are authentically positive, my government party - in the form of change - acknowledges disagreements, and offers no defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of felonyism."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snowden said he believes that he can support the international community to persuade the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include intelligence and theft from the government's assets.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Affairs Minister, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snowden has been willing to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been bugged.
Thomas Operman, MP who is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence. That would have been the opportunity to hear Mr. Snow Den as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the U.S. and putting them in danger," even then it should be taken.
Mr. Strauss Belle, an MP from Germany's Green Party, published a photo of herself with Mr. Snow Den on Twitter feed.
He was on a visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to former NSA contractor lawyer, Snowden is not able to go back to Russia if he leaves Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be "safe" there that would require assurances, the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he was forced to leave home for the "he faced a fierce and sustained campaign".
However, he said that the world is happy and overwhelmed by wide-ranging responses to his work of political expression.
World citizens, including the United States, as well as high officials, have judged the revelation of a irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the human condition have been resolved."
Frontier Airlines Carry - Charge on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store luggage carry-on for passengers on its plane board.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carry - on fee is for bags in overhead bins, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance of passengers.
We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are stuffing as much as they can carry - in on baggage which is stashed in overhead compartment, it means this compartment often has less space.
Fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charge money.
It has become increasingly difficult to find the place of overhead bins that is for the most loyal customers about Frontier.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline's own website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate, can get a bag free.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and processes of check-in are being changed to ensure passengers know about the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fees will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often appear dissatisfied about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline prefers them.
They argue that it costs money to handle the baggage, and that travelers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched carry-on bag charges though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. launched the carry-on fee three years ago, and the fellow discounter Allegiant Air later.
There is a fee as well as other airline Hungary's Wizz Air, which the airline adviser Jay Sorensen said, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the Spirit and expressed surprise at the passengers having to face the carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was seamless," he said.
I was hoping to grind the teeth and look out at a battle gate.
The plane was full and he climbed it lickety-split."
Frontier is also following a $2 fee of 'spirit' for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee only for once.
It will still give away water.
U.S. Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but the passengers complained after seven months later they retreated and followed after no other main airline was there.
If Frontier's passengers do not purchase directly from the airline, then this move by Frontier to charge a fee on Carry-On is its fresh effort to operate customers towards its own website.
Airlines Online Travel pays the seller Orbitz for each sold ticket from such $10 to $25.
That is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, many often began to pay half of the flight miles to customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip miles.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the only passengers on purchase directly from the Frontier website.
The city of Denver in Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home town, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenues declined by 9 percent and its flight capacity decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republicans are trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of airline sales.
NSA accuses "internal error" instead of hackers for website crashes
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiencies, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the pre-determined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that this constraint came due to the distributed denial of service [DDOS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not accessible.
A NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network was "not compromised at all."
The spokesperson said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA's website by a DDOS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to penetrate the system's internal network.
The former highly enigmatic NSA, once named as "no such agency," has become a subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public over the recent months when a large number of foreign and domestic espionage programs appeared - after being stolen and remedied by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden from the agency.
Due to this growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
A beautiful expression was presented in harmony with the plot 'Another Dronacharya' in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown in today's perspective in which fetters a guru is forced to walk the wrong path.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice Presidents of Cantonment Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St Joseph Inter College.
The play depicts the similarities between Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and the circumstances of a professor, Arvind, at present.
Directed by Anil Sharma, the play features Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Becharan, Hemant Goel, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc.
In the play, the lighting was done by young theatre artist Jitendra C. Raj and set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were given by Apta to the literary, cultural contributors.
It was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department, Charan Singh University, and senior journalist Shambhunath Shukla, and Rangakram Jitendra C. Raj.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. were among the officials of the executive in making the event a success.
Bombardier's profits fall as delivery of aircraft, orders decline
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a drop of 15 percent in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and lower aircraft orders and deliveries as pressure on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues that will release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or complete its ambitious program of moving aircraft to commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test plane about another half a month ago, it has just been flown three times, questioning whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell short of the forecast and the stock is sent to more than 8 percent sliding on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, downgraded his ratings for the "field performance" from the "weapon" on Thursday. The stock is limited to up to the next one or two quarters.
Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, there is a suspicion that the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier expects aircraft families to cut it at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after the month of delay.
Potential buyers wait for the flight test results to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as confirmed orders for CSeries are medium to 177.
A total of 403 orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time of bringing the first jet into commercial use.
The officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was going on as per schedule.
The test aircraft had lived on land for a longer period than anticipated," Baudoin said in a conference call, adding that land testing and software updates were also scheduled during the aircraft's interval.
Every manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and to make an updated period and that's what we've done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts are skeptical that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said it will evaluate the Service in Admission (EIS) schedule and provide an update in the next few months.
This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that the service at entry will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion modestly.
Analysts at Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S were expected to earn 10 cents per share and a revenue of $4.56 billion.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the low-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Baudoin said.
13 per cent drop in $2 billion in aerospace revenue.
Bombardier said revenue in the division, the world's largest train manufacturer, was up nearly 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
The orders in the transport unit were backlogged at around $32.6 billion on September 30, up from modest December 31.
Some of the major contracts in the margins of the Transport Division were also affected by execution issues.
Executives said new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Among the shares of Bombardier, which Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichett announced the board's joining, on Thursday's mid-afternoon trading was also down 8.5 percent at C$4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profits on Thursday.
New research has shown that we work with full sincerity and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone and don't think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and walk against the rule.
Researchers at Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business in Utah have given many interesting facts.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values in the morning without work stress, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or over-pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point is higher on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that they would be given money if they answered incorrectly instead of the correct answer.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting with people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping their principles in check.
This enabled researchers to prove that the lure of money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the miscreants fled from the spot.

Cocaine-addicted lawyer sentenced to prison for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
The 42-year-old Basharat Datta used to inform infamous criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The top defense lawyer, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, as he feared people would know about his drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
42-year-old Barash Dita, after compromising on his cocaine addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking activities.
This advocate, who was nicknamed "Bash" and was praised by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous narcotics trial.
The authorities had seen the 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After finding particles of cocaine in Dita's hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Dita was a "regular user" of drugs in the A category.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, she attempted to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation of heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merceside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons who were sent to jail after police seized 1.5 million pounds of heroin and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds of cash during several raids.
The 42-year-old Dita used to provide information to criminals, as she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Detta, a law firm operating in Blackburn, was today facing trial in Liverpool Crown Court after being found guilty of two cases of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
She had admitted to having cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when the police, while investigating Scarborough, found that he had been in regular contact with Dita over the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him coming to Detta's house and placing more than 60 percent purity drugs under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After the drug was placed, Scarborough was in regular contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at the Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that the drug was kept there and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that she was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the trial if clues were found to be a category A drug on Detta's hair, wallet and credit cards.
Dita was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to a suspected dealer as he was his client and said his discussion was a subject of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Datta tried to remove a lot of credit cards from his wallet, but he was seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients used to call his house for legal matters.
After the main persons who were arrested told what the spies knew about them, the court said that Datta used to call the leading people of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had earlier presented a case.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: "The criminal advocate should know best about not breaking the law."
Mr. Dita is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, connecting too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a normal drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his limits of lawyer-client relationship.
He interrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they remained able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dita was not respecting his profession, but insulting it.
He made a lot of closeness to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his freedom to compromise.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, but I would have done it right away."
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "At the time Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal."
Due to his addiction to cocaine, he compromised heavily and became very vulnerable to the objectives of leading members of organized crime groups who used it to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Dita, who was also found guilty of three incidents of possessing cocaine and now disrupting the course of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members of the gang were sent to jail for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On her website, Detta gave questions and answers about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a client with a death penalty in the US, her dinner guest of Mohammed Ali, and her inequity to be an inspiration for her work.
Kenya's press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying that "it is a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the independence of the judiciary in tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM, said, "This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it."
He said the new media tribunal "will always be partisan, as it is part of the government" and said banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send back the MP people," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government "strict control over the media", while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "have suffered a severe blow" and described the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after an Islamic gunman attacked the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya's media had broadcast security camera footage of squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them looting the mall objectively, prompting authorities to anger Kenya's media.
Police chief David Kimyo had summoned two journalists and a media person for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after the media ruffled.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings and the additional risk of being "removed from the list" or denied official press recognition will be different.
The Tribunal also has the power to seize the property of the infringer if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "a penalty is enough to shake the foundation of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures could lead to the degenerative effects that Kenya has described as a "living blogosphere."
By closing the media's mouths, politicians know that they can make their own arbitrariness.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "Nobody will ever know."
When left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the era of hunting and depositing.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he had voted in favour of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restoring about 532,000 shilling monthly, tax-free bodybuilders salary, which is considered to be among the world's highest.
The birthday of Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian in the world, is on November 1, but as the clock ticked on October 30, the whole of Jodhpur reverberated with the birthday of Nita Ambani.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was completely formed by the performance of AR Rahman's team.
Rahman performed his signature songs at the musical night, which began at 8 p.m.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to mix the beautiful colours of the dance.
Around 32 charters for guests attending Nita Ambani's birthday arrived in Jodhpur.
The charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur due to reduced parking space at Jodhpur airport.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and Jaguar were ordered.
Sood said that the cleanliness system in the city, the street light has failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that the house from Panchkula be completely destroyed.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors, but they do not have the power to get work done.
As a result, the city councilor has become a dummy and the officials are working according to their own requirements.
Sood said that the municipal corporation has crores of rupees, but interest is being charged by depositing all the money in banks as FDs.
But no steps are being taken to put money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of the dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in the sectors across the Ghaggar are forced to live a hellish life for the last several years.
Municipal authorities have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the past several years, but the people of Barwala area are already getting two to four from the serious problem of flies.
He said that the health services and education system in the villages have deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
UN sets new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations is set to immediately begin work on a new set of goals that will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
In order to replace the MDDs that ended in 2015, the Australian diplomat played an important role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" just before the overnight vascular development summit in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "rise above national interests."
I am very happy that the Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting up the Universal Sustainable Development Goals.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be a part of the overall development framework after 2015.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to fulfil our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDG.
Mozambique's security concerns grow as powerful individuals clash
With a statue of Mozambique founder President Samora staring down at him, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant peace in a rare public demonstration.
We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Terrified about her country's future, she changed her corporate attire from a printed T-shirt in a Portuguese "we demand security" and joined the crowd at the capital Independence Square on Thursday.
The conflict between government forces and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost daily, more than 20 years before a peace deal.
Ray Namo was initially a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled Rhodesia and the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace deal, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy of the northwest exploring the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves of Rio Tinto, Brazil's Well, some of the companies including Eni could bring in investments of over $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members on October 17 in Sofa La Province, the traditional Ek Ray Namo bastion
The attack on former rebels and then increased government forces attacked the Reno bases and told the Financial Times that Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group leader, Fernando Majhang, tried to kill Ray Namo's spokesman.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing the soldiers of attacking it.
President Armando Jibuzhan has called for unfailing of concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" of "whatever his forces have remained to try to prove that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Majhang was quoted as saying that Ray Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace deal but has since become a matter of concern.
He told FT that that agreement is not being awarded by the Free Limo
Our vision is to return to negotiation, but seriously," Mr. Majhang said.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the tensions fuelled by this year's conflict of a series.
It's about two big men fighting together (Jibushan and Dhakama)," said Joseph Han, a lecturer at London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them are ready to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Ray Namo's share in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in elections.
Mr Majhang Jibushenko, who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year, wants to destroy the country's democracy.
He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Majhang said.
What kind of capability Ray Namo has not clarified, but it is a major North South Highway police stations and vehicles on the disruptive hit-and-run tours he has made..
Most of the skirmishes are in the sofa La Prefecture, several hundred kilometers north of Zomaputo, with host Beira Port trusting to export coal to miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley.
In June, after threatening to attack the Ray Namo line, the railways suspended its experiment for about a week.
Whether or not Ray Namo will be able to replicate this threat was almost when Mr. Majhangvinit was asked.
Ray Namo "Things were not going well in Mozambique that wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Majhang said.
The government of instability further exacerbated frustrations, says Fernando Lima, media cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods of kidnappings.
The people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
The Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need stability.
No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends, "as models for a way of life's author".
Thor's stories could show "there is no counter to all the subtle moves in brutal strength," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths to teach are also "exceptionally far away from the wild and in some cases even in porn and schools it would not be appropriate to be taught," Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of appropriate works of age.
I find it amazing, in the US, myths and folklore are already a part of education," he said.
I have been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He called the writers and teachers "more enlightening" and this is "a new turn" for children, together with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated Beowulf from Anglo Saxons together with writing the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps an adult writer writing for a child and an adult writer writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
Everything is simplified or come to a happy end, but it is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than stated revealed through a story.
The old base is not showing.

Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fey, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to people sitting in the crowd in a manner of conversation.
Fe's discovery has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Standup Institute called Carolines, this year celebrated its 10th anniversary, including more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became a huge success, to a level where they became too big to be played in the club," Hirsch says.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" which featured Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come through non-traditional mediums, such as comedy shows coming on smaller networks such as Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll reached the leading spot from Deep-Cable sitcom (F.X.'s hilariously Ronchi fantasy-football-themed "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation" although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crawl and Slate (anthony Jesselnik with a completely different disheartening voice, satirical, ethnically focused W. Kamau Bell) are the products of the American comedy's decentralized world.
One of the most highlight of the celebration will be an interview: David Steinberg speaking to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's works," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he was here, he sometimes went to the street between two buildings and thought to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would be here.
Oil continues to decline to $96 per barrel
A report showing concerns about oversupply like the oil price continued to decline on Friday is offset where the power-hungry manufacturing sector in China is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in Europe until late morning in electronic trading on the American Raw New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 5.8 percent down for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
More than five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand increased activity showed that two reports on Chinese manufacturing came on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a decline in the last quarter of 7.8 per cent in the third quarter from a two-decade period.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries.
The court has blocked the New York Police Department's pause and action on sports policy
On Thursday, a federal appeals court blocked changes requiring a judge's order for the New York Police Department's pause and play program and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court Appeals 2nd Judge Shira Schindler has said that the judge will defer the verdict on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
In Judge Nagar, it had ruled in August in violation of the Constitution in the manner of preventing people and excluding them from its programme of questioning.
The city's police department includes its policy and decision to allocate a monitoring to help change the training program associated with it, its findings and its remedial order have appealed.
The appeal court heard arguments on the request stay on Tuesday.
The appeal court has said that since it entered into a requirement agreement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and that the public had acted differently from the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges, the judge's case should be removed, the statements should be publicly responded to by criticizing the court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and play program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras on some premises where she is most likely to have stops.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after the 14th March 2014.
Punctuation and sport tactics have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The break-up and sports policy has been around for decades in any form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, from 684330 to an all-time high in 2011 has been recorded under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically prevents growth.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men of all minorities and became a class action case.
Proponents of NYPD's break-up and changes to the sports program have said that unfair behavior will end up molding a more reliable and effective police force and other police departments can influence using the policy..
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but crime, waste money and will not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the last decade.
The judge noted that there was no end to the pause and play, which is constitutional, but had improved the implementation of NYPD's stop.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
Over a period of seven days, all participants were informed of several lores including tent pitching, flag pole.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading the spirit of unity by joining all the religions in prayer.
Camp Head Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Colson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark's love affair when he was home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Adis QC told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulkair to hack Polby's voicemail and "keep an eye" on the male, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said, "The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people's house and keep an eye on them, but rather he places articles before the people to see what people react to him."
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one included the editor himself.
It is evident that he knew the other way around, that is, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
The rumour about Clark's love affair was first introduced by the feature desk of A.O.T.W. when a source in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
From home to Mulkshire in August 2006, at least three of Ms. Polby's phone calls were seized from the tape of voicemail.
Investigators also found such entries in the personal investigator's computer on which Ms. Polby and her sister were named "Projects".
During the period during which she was being examined, information about her was sought by anonymous phone calls to Ms. Polby's grandparents.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched Ms. Polby's visit.
On June 18, 2005, Collson told him through a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said Coulson's involvement in the case is in Parton, with other important individuals, such as former home secretary David Blanket.
The bench heard on Thursday that Collson had a conversation with Mr. Blunkett about the love affair with a married woman, while at that time he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebekha Brooks who was then married.
Collson and Brooks refused to commit a duel with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200. and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have accepted phone hacking.
Promoting corporate fear from NSA disclosures about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter scrambled at the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the domestic intelligence agency of Germany, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of listening antennas and indicated an exchange action between the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the US and Berlin.
James Klepper, director of U.S. national intelligence, stressed that the U.S. should use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and increase American companies' international competitiveness or increase their bottom line."
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has become a whistleblower, began to tell the American surveillance a treasure trove of his secrets, the European government and business leaders are no longer sure that the director would keep his word.
The U.S. national security agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and expressed fears about state surveillance by our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo.
The last thing came when it turned out that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, then certainly business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made in-depth cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies consultancy, the U.S. has almost now become a major risk for industrial espionage and data theft, when it comes to China.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all documentation, however, there is no evidence to date that the U.S. has known the business secrets of foreign companies to its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are doubting this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German trade software company SAP, said "It's no way."
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they wouldn't have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany. From coal, cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations exposed by Snowden about U.S. technological sophistication and spy access have proven to be a shock to some companies who previously believed that the biggest surveillance threat is China.
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10% of non-US members cancelled plans to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP's co-CEO, says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't come across a year ago - is - where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must guard these at all costs.
It's not a surprise that economic espionage happens.
It has always been.
This has been a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussions, nothing has changed" says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical producer BASF.
At the U.S. commercial and industrial level, we spy on and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business
Corporate leaders are generally not inclined about the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it has been a long time since the message is being recorded whether it is unwise to leave a business from home with a USB stick, or to say the least it is unwise to leave a laptop in a hotel room unscathed.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of the carmaker Audi, says it's a year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to risks on overseas trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away.
However, it is a concern that small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, it is the top company in the global market in special place.
Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The United States has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, the name of the US national intelligence in February named in a second tier of criminals engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, which is behind China with Russia and Israel.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to economic espionage, "Frenchs are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview that: "Services well know that all countries, even if they support non-terrorist fighting, spy on their allies."
At the U.S. commercial and industrial level, we spy on and we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our business
No one became a fool.
Parents of a Georgia teenager killed in a 'unique accident' believe his son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat at her high school gym believes her son was murdered, the family advocate said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA, was found trapped in a mat standing straight behind bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators at Landes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson had died in a 'unique accident', but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Crump, who submitted to Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He does not believe in death in the manner described by the Sheriff.
Crump said that he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical law and general intelligence.
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulray said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation about Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told the reporter that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of a "situational asphyxia."
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death."
There are a lot of questions that should be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative for comments from the office of the Lodge County Sheriff was not immediately available.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope that the video footage will give some indication of how he died.
CDC issues guidelines for children's allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. have food allergies.
The CDC found that there was an 18% increase in food allergies among children between 1997 and 2007.
This guideline provides information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies, and how to handle them if there is an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep stocks of epinephrine to potentially counteract life-threatening anaphylaxis - the auto-injector of the eappen brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to keep stocks of epinephrine in large quantities easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms that children with allergic reactions transmit.
Children may say "It seems like something is pricking in my tongue," "It looks like I have hair on my tongue," or "It's getting tingling in my tongue."
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose Their Children's 'Gender Undetermined'
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for babies born with a vague genitalia.
Now newborns will no longer be assigned male or female in a conservative manner.
According to the new law, parents are not required to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender 'undefined' or 'unspecified' on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make gender-specific surgical decisions for newborns in a hurry, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man had said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will continue to be a bruised, scarred patch made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under scrutiny for disorders of sexual development, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, the genitourinary (ovary or testicular), or abnormally developed sex.
Wells Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before surgery, if such a situation occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialises in gender-identity cases, said Germany's new law "appears to be a good thing."
Intersex children create moral confusion.
Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but most children don't," he said.
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described differently from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not related to gender but to their biological composition, which is not explicitly male or female, but either a combined form or none of the two is clearly defined.
These characteristics can display secondary sexual traits, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual traits such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal for life-long "unspecified" gender status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have the third specifications as X for intersex persons apart from M or F.
According to news reports on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition for the withdrawal of the "sex theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, saying, "While the world is moving to a state where gender is the choice itself, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction."
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see the babies being assigned sex at birth.
Raising is very stressful without additional limitations, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is," he said on the website about the upbringing.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called Hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world regarded sex as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, understanding that gender-identity is a complex task, and sometimes there may be mistakes from physicians who don't know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
In the middle of the twentieth century, it used to be called a "psychological emergency."
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of the University of John Hopkins, who considered the gender to be subservient.
He composed the term "sex identity" and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise a child - determine whether he or she should be identified as a male or as a female by interacting with the child's genes and hormones.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child who had sex accidentally during a circummission to get his testicles taken out and reared like a girl.
Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but it didn't happen," the dredger said.
At the age of 15, the child turned back to himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Drescher said that there are still some physicians who are "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to appear "not happy with the result."
The same case was with 36-year-old Montana writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but her genitals were unclear.
The doctors clearly did not understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was hard to ask.
At the age of 18, he was going to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and somewhat upset, he demanded medical records.
This led him to discover the terrible truth.
At the time of my birth, I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he turned back to being a man, took a dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people his perception of intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to normalize.
But, Anne Tamer-Matis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chipping and stigma."
Many activists feel that Germany's law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and "determinate" the child," she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, it is better to specify the male or female gender.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender."
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender," he said.
The law of Germany relates to specifying it at the time of birth.
It is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Bartz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "strengthen both parents and children."
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a DSD called full androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since she had a defect in her androgen receptor, female traits developed in Katy.
She has a vaginal in her body but does not have a uterus or ovarian.
Katy, 29, is now married and has a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
This law allows parents not to make hasty decisions on their own.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some test before writing, 'male' or 'female'.
In this way, you stay fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a cute baby and have fun with him.
We don't need to have surgery in a hurry that can't be returned.
It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don't believe they're doing well," he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
This enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton as Biden's replacement for Vice President ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the massively anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Helemann of Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "comprehensive group-sessions and polls in late 2011" to learn what dumping Biden could help in the fall of Obama's re-election hopes.
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides complete information about the efforts of the chief executives in the campaign and the White House, the head of the former White House staff for the name of the bill, to find out what the change of former state secretary Clinton from the vice president has to do with the poll.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlarod and David Pallouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
Double Down claims that Dale tried to change Biden despite his personal rapport with him before finally making a decision when he was informed that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
I said keeping an eye on the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in such a state that, "Holy Christ, what else shall we do?"
While Dale described research as "precautions," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments to find out how much dividend it would give when polled.
Campaigns don't spend money on voting and focused groups unless they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for a change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dali if his boss knew of a possible reshuffle.
While Dale said he "didn't think the president was aware of the potential change", the former Chief of Staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
Double Down" certainly won't answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk? Martin explained further.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama Biden was not aware of dumping ticket research.
Probably," Martin said.
Do you like the glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and China's convinced scientists used chemical luster to re-polishing the protein.
Ice cream will increase the pH level of the protein by reacting with the tongue of the eater and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream ignites with the heat of the mouth reacting, that is, the more you lick the winning, the more it ignites.
Charlie, the founder of the Liquor I'm Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: "It's an incredible thing but the early days of production will get around £200 to two grams of stuff."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing for the past few months and feel perfect to share it on Halloween as it gives amazing glow effects
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I've made because the glistening of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Although iska taste is very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company, famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next creation is going to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the refraction over ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the fluorescence properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
The entire market was packed with customers in Rani Bagh market.
It was recently that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy the pot.
The same was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Central Market in Prashant Vihar.
A similar sight was seen at the bullion shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver jewellery and coins.
Due to this, there was a jam in other markets including the outer ring road.
However, the people who left the office for the house had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up games for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I have become more than a greedy
I didn't even sign in to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and maybe this year won't be the same.
But the statistics show that I have a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween this time around $158 million. $6.9 billion will be spent on candies and costumes and decorations.
One thing that I have always seen is the trends of every Halloween.
According to the NRF, the total spending of the dress out of $6.9 billion is $1.2 billion.
This year, everyone is angry with sexy lifeless things.
Women don't have to have sex, because they are sexy food like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
I hope a lot of zombis for men, and thanks to the changing lives of the dead, our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costume will be Zombies, Batman, Robbers and Witches.
I guess there's no harm in being traditional.
Last year we dressed up dogs and were not alone in the surprise.
According to the NRF, American people will literally spend $330 million for pet costumes.
It is ironic that a lot of hotdogs are with dogs.
We don't look around when it comes to candy.
According to the Nielsen company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairsty Bars, Lollipops, Milk Dads, Twizlers and Clark Bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, it is good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are going to take part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candycorns, but they will also sell around 35 million pounds.
That is about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
This is a mystery. Yet to solve
There is nothing more to Tatvamayi Halloween than ghost houses.
They are best named, "Terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Scream-o-Scream" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to American power, there are 1200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenue. And the awesome good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the guy who likes to see you and comments on Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, there was the "Baby in a Pamkin trend" that started last year, thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not being sold with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, the U.S. will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o-slow-slow-smooth lantern on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew by 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional loans, try to carve up their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin, in phone Tim and Susan Mates Napa, Caliph., and above.
It was decided that a postal stamp bearing Sachin's photograph be issued during the presentation before the start of the match.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
Apart from this, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be taken care of by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure, which will contain articles related to Tendulkar and statements from business, sports and the journalist world about him.
The association said the limited number of these brochures and coins will be distributed to members of the MCA and BCCI.
Every day 10000 masks, 10000 score cards and 10000 caps will be distributed which will have Sachin's photos.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced

Its options include - upgraded brakes, service packages that provide access to vehicle collection between baller works mechanics, logistic support, and events.
Drew Baller, managing director of Baller Motorsport, said: "The rally customers coming into the baller have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people looking for a path that can lead to excitement and adventure and world-class events.
We are delighted to provide this pathway in partnership with Land Rollover and MSA, and we believe that this format provides a new way to experience different rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigor and truth of the rally raid.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenger will provide training and testing days in the month of February as well as the option to compete in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area was not realized.
The firecracker traders are stuck in the middle after the High Court order.
Neither can they now trade in the temporary cracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for trading in the transport area.
The commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary cracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
Due to lack of proper arrangements, Amritsar Deputy Commissioner was also fined Rs 10 lakh.
In its order, the High Court has lashed out at the administrative authorities of Amritsar, saying that what work was done by an administration that could not solve even one problem of crackers traders for nine years.
They could not be provided the right place in the city.
After proper security arrangements, firecracker traders were asked to issue licences for the business in the shipyard market itself.
After this order, even though the firecracker traders became happy, on their happiness, the police turned back the water on Friday.
A team of police's Aalsha license branch reached the cracker market and sold the farm by putting counters there.
It was then impossible to fulfill the conditions that were stated to them in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharge of Asalha License Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the cracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
So licenses were not issued to firecracker traders.
Diwali is one day left.
As a result, the firecracker traders are upset.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say they will stake claim against the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecracker traders took out a fury march from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the temporary cracker market in Ranjit Avenue also closed business.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after coming into a small road collision
He was spotted by a dog walker trapped in the mine after three days
Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from the mouth of the death
After the puppy somehow got stuck at the mouth of the distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground, the firemen were called to give him a lucky life.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were in the flappit mine in western Yorkshire to meet Denholm, Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a minor accident, he had searched for his lost dog like crazy, and had posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on the mountain in the mine.
A technical rescue team from the Clayheaton Fire Station reached the scene and took Ruby down by the rope to save her and used a belly tube to bring her down from the rock.
Expert Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not do a single act during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now he is good.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual call for help.
It is incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby survived in a fortunate way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, Western Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see rescue work"
At first, I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they did is really a great deal of courage.
We were proud of them, and they were all the best.
Mr. Alderson from Keegli also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't hit Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had sung backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and "when I was 18, he hit me."
This thing got old, and he treats me well," he said.
The 70-year-old Jagger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies about ever striking Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Perry is saying about him in another person's misunderstanding"
Perry was one of the singers who came on this year's Rolling Stone Tour as a guest.
His new album, Prism, reached the top spot this week.
George Kerevan: Euro Disruption Gives Scots an Option
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel region throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The passport control over Barwick and the barbed wire border on the walls of Hadrian indicate the stories.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictablely - it was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to their own needs.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen Area, there will be affordable discounts for continuing non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what Brussels really wants from Scotland.
So, then, the non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long is frozen. First of all I heard the baseless news about 40 years ago about "freedom means passport control."
Yet the interesting point in retelling this interesting old story was lost.
Why should independent Scotland expect to bid for Europe anyway?
Why buy and sell London's yoke to Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Parties dedicated to opposing the EU or closing the euro as a common currency throughout the EU are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptal Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly gained nearly half a million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical change.
As well as the stringent regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the constraints imposed on national economies through compliance with the same currency have caused a lot of people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not have much of a role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the Euro system fixed the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a state of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
There is deep European productivity morbidity far beyond the current budget and currency problems.
To exempt French and German energy firms on consumer expenditures - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas as compared to the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even the freezing of all salaries in the world, European petrochemicals cannot save the industry from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major EU fan.
After the war, France's top politicians saw the EU as a measure to control Germany, and Paris as a way to provide Washington with equal billing in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which has caused the French economy to falter.
Results: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-EU National Front, has won the recently held by-election by pushing the ruling Socialist to third place.
At the moment the front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - it is a timely warning to the British Labour that they cannot assume that the dissolution for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his newfound fame in the middle of the French whites, the working class?
The team wants to use the EU elections to be held next year to create an anti-EU, pro-democracy bloc in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then this type of faction can affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the union of anti-EU and anti-opinionist sentiment in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not be fully exhausted, but it will return in some form such as the retail "Europe of the (sovereign) nations" which will be supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its retainer economies can maintain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope the U.K. will keep itself away from this project in hopes of expanding its closeness with the U.S.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain (essentially) the area of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests — including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-federal nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence by following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - remarkably - has been the most successful anti-affordability political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 based on the Tory-Lib Dame coalition, opposing (and executing) cuts proposed by Labour's chancellor Alistair Darling.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as in that case it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at an early age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheriz, a former CNN correspondent, is an expert journalist in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breast and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
Pediatric endocrinologist Dr Paul Caplovitz at the annual conference of the U.S. Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week clarified that these early physical changes are common among American girls, reflecting new trends.
I spend a lot of time convincing parents - that usually it doesn't reflect the rapid progress towards absolute puberty," Caplovitz says.
Direct signs of growth such as sprouting of the breast, genital and armpit hair and physical smell are visible in girls ahead of time.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual period).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
The first menopause takes at least two to three years when the breast begins to develop," explains Caplovitz, who is also the author of "Premature puberty in girls: the guide necessary to cope with this common problem."
The most accurate test of the development of puberty is time.
There is debate about what the onset of puberty is, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8, two call it "child-mature."
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which pediatricians can observe closely.
In case of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may be required to examine the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments for premature menstrual and other consequences are: premature ageing of the bones, which can lead to underdeveloped growth and short stature as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, "Pressing puberty can raise behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel different from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: parents simply don't want their underage daughter to have menstruation.
They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Caplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and returned upset that she had started menstruation first among her friends.
There are a lot of well-known theories about the causes of untimely puberty.
However, there is no continuing evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually-oriented messages in the media can be charged.
Boys - just like girls - are gaining premature puberty.
Caplovitz sets the rule that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct studies on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001, which combine body fat with puberty.
Other outcomes support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty, from economic conditions to weather and jeans, seems to be influenced by everything.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of full puberty is not as obvious as girls in them.
Other practitioners who attended the A.A.P. conference supported the complexity of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," says Dr. Laurens Silverman, pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "This may mean having a conversation ahead of the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Premature growth of girls needs to be assured that even if it is premature, it is part of normal life.
On Thursday, the temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius.
The rain and cold winds on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wore sweaters and went to the markets and their destination.
People have also pulled out quilts after the first rain of the winter.
In the morning, people were also seen enjoying the sun.
As the weather changed, there will also be a lot of relief from cold, etc., but after that, due to the cloudy day, the sun continued to shine.
The children also went to school wearing sweaters.
At the same time, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department.
It received 7.8 mm of rain.
According to the Meteorological Department, the sky will remain cloudy.
Large orders of jet manufacturers at stake from the dispute for seat width.
This month's Dubai Arsho is set to set the pace for a fight between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat on long-haul flights, not always as given by airlines but whose allotted space efficiency is claimed to be key by the latest Jet Erbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Arbus has hoped to give at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seats in the economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute arises between the aircraft manufacturers when a large version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft competed with a possible recorded order after the 17-21 incident.
How has the previous department of aircraft been created- especially if the seating is equal to 9 or 10. Design of mini jumbo jets is being prepared keeping in mind the claims of more capacity?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" that will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the monolithic department.
Airbus says that while competing with the A350, it will take 350 people to an 18-inch left seat with 9 equal seats.
Aircraft giants often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, with Airbus 777 X expected to dominate over 100 orders in Dubai's Arsho, this is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that anything has been the beginning of the Vigiapan war, showing this to Finsero, will you accept it all together in a restaurant together?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "Boeing is also offering long-distance flight from regional turbos to narrowseats."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 Jumbo Ne modern long-time ki trip was defined, and the ant me of the century averaged 40 - 49-year-old American male's weight increased me by 10 percent.
According to U.S. health statistics, the average U.S. male has a waistline of 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the average perimeter of the new name "jet set" was narrow.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an additional 53% sleep quality in the seat width.
Boeing has disputed Airbus' seat measurement data, and has said it is not dependent on manufacturers' decision on how the balance between airlines fares and facilities is formed.
It also says, research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin over.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said, "This really explains what it takes to provide flexibility to airlines and what they believe to be successful."
They don't want to tell us who they benefit from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about elbow rooms, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that can affect income.
At least $700 billion worth of trade is behind this controversy. The aircraft order competition is enough in the coming decades, to tip the scales of American and European exports.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, what seat layout is really a battle issue between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that their new twin-engine design had 20 percent efficiency per seat compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er.
Boeing's performance claim depends on the 777 X One with 10 compared with the 777 design with the original 9.
The unit cost has now been used 10 times compared with the profit.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, says "This Boeing aircraft is doing it to make our products more competitive, with more seats to occupy."
Analysts, on the other hand, say the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin for the existing 777S suggests that many travelers are in favor of the Denser layout, which can go with cheap fares as well.
The 18-inch seat width will be great for travelers, but the reality is that this business point offer from Airbus is powered by the 777 threat," said Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet vendors from all over the world should also take careful measures to check on this layouts event.
Resting more, all builders are also offering low-cost aircraft services and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets for more cabin facility needed.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it may deviate from the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end smoking enjoyment
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for the rest of their lives.
There is a need for further testing before trials on humans begin, which may take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs are positive.
We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately help millions of smokers who have attempted to quit smoking using all the methods that exist in the market in today's time, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is far more potent than these existing methods," Cornell said.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent nicotine from rising inside the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the test, rats who were given nicotine later continued to perform their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine was "good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking again they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of nicotine vaccine, which can help them get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need to do too much research.
Even after the post-mortem, the curtain could not rise due to the actual death of the tigress.
The Forest Department, in a voluminous reply to this, is prima facie describing the death of the tigress as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of the Ramnagar forest division found the body of a tigress near the Pawalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi nala.
All the body parts of the tigress were safe and there were no wounds or injury marks on the tigress.
On Friday, the body of the tigress was post-mortemed by CTR veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, deputy director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, the internal body of the tigress is said to be damaged during the post-mortem.
The exact cause of the tiger's death could not be ascertained.
Departmental officials continued to respond to the tigress's death.
However, the internal organs of the tigress have been sent to IvRI Bareilly for a topsycologic examination to confirm the poisoning.
Conservator of Forests Western Circle Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tigress can only be called natural.
No signs of poisoning etc. have been found from the tigress's body.
However, for this, the area around the area is being searched as well as sending an investigation to confirm the poison.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW labour minister Joe Tripodi will be examined by the State Corpus Watchdog.
Former NSW labour minister Joe Tripodi has refused to refute the policy of maritime leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obide, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obide, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed whether Mr. Obide had issued a notice to several state ministers for violation of the circulars of the Lease Policy? Where Obide owned two restaurants and cafes, without tender, were renewed in August 2005 after its expiration.
After the evidence given by Lin Aspole, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden interests of Mr. Obide?
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for the introduction of public tenders for leases.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the enterprises of the circular for leases, from which Obide earned $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a lease tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change on the request of Mr. Obide, Mr. Tripodi had requested for a change in the government lease policy
Transcripts presented in a phone call to ICAC in August and September 2007 Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obide's Fisheries Department after working at the Ministry of Ports
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty asked Mr. Tripodi. "What was being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case, developing commercial lease policy?"
No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighters stormed Syria.
Israeli fighters targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed Fox News, a senior administration official.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there was at least one objective.
The Associated Press reports that the target Russian missiles were SA-125.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can undergo a "authenticity" test
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to extend a rigorous action.
If adopted, the test will be carried out through a criteria designed to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to prevent 457 being used to deliver family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, former Labour MP M.M.M.McQ today said it could anger Australia's neighbouring countries.
He told the US India Institute today that the loud rhetoric about "foreign people are reaching the end of the queue" and "Australian people first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have demanded a safe labor market."
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been provided security - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area had seen echoes of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met officials about traffickers, has implemented five recommended changes while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsor or the relative or personal partner of the relevant person".
Businesses may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after coming into a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday, after the death of his father, one of his adult cousins, who was on the same vessel, had been confounded.
Australian authorities took the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "make Britain one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very "excited" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of the second phase, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England to £42.6 billion from £32.7 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider possibilities to further improve rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less of potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be much higher.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown pointed out: "High-speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire case of high-speed rail across the UK."
So we are excited to work in partnership with the British government, so that we can explore options for bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all, and meeting the Glasgow-Edinburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the ministers of the British government next year and making a decision together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will remain in effect in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers must continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left options open to U.S. aircraft service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their equipment during the critical stages of flight, provided that the equipment remains in the "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can still do this during a lot of flights, but many people do not like being unable to fly and access their e-book etc. while landing.
Australian aircraft service companies are considering this decision, according to which US aircraft service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective in Australia at critical stages of flight.
Currently CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, adding that the issue falls under regulations, according to which airlines have to ensure that the safety arrangements are always in place, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members."
Virgin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked to take further action on the directive of the regulator.
We would welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel like it would provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft.
Quantas said it would follow the current rules.
According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during flight and landing, and we do not have an immediate plan to change it," it said.
FAA decisions apply to U.S. allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will definitely consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and briefs to passengers.
After verification of the tolerability of their aircraft by airlines, it will allow passengers to use handheld, light-weight electrical equipment such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in upper compartments during flight and landing.
Silver of ponbrokers due to the difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Ameerthalinga is taking cash by paying her daughter's school fees by giving her gold bangle, ring and earrings at a Ponshop at Bendmeier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it.
She says, although she earns $3,000 as administrator ($2,400) and her husband also works, the family's monthly income remains inadequate.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is rising - Valuemax where they are doing their transactions became the third Ponshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Mortgage of jewellery is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but is almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
In Singapore, ponbrokers charge an interest of 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are flocking to the pounshop due to increased living expenses by families and increased domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after a global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to the simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to PonShop to meet their needs due to the slowing down of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard's Angel Poor's, mainly cited rising domestic gains due to mounting mortgages, as a risk factor for the eligibility of Asian banks.
Asia has the highest proportion of GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, it said.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about higher levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged a bit from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a steady export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
The deciding point is that with rising prices, [income scale] middle-to-lower class people will try to increase their income in every way possible," said Song Seng Woon, economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged at City-State's 200 pon outlets are gold.
People are saying, "Gold price looks good, let's pledge Grandma's gold chain, and take back next month."
Egemony, Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is so much growth in the pledging business that the outlet's operators in Bendimir, Valuemax and 15 others, like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, in Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valuemax, says.
The company will finance it with 60 per cent of the $66 million it has received this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While high interest rates have led to criticism of some discount lenders, Ms. Yah says pledging not only offers an affordable rate compared to other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
Customers pledge items that they already have, and capitalizing on personal assets doesn't increase household debt," she says.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing in order to get short-term and secure financial support.
It is not that ponbrokers are used only by financially weak individuals.
Wealthy individuals in Singapore also use valuemax outlets, pledging gold bars or Rolex watches, which can pay up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all sections of the society.
These include wealthy individuals who need a short term loan for a business venture or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements," says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a very short time.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a large party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend the party. On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, etc.
Obviously, when such a big name joins the party, you can guess how big this Jalsa will be.
$325 million rescue package for Taiji's health
The Union government has stressed that tough conditions are also attached with the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ill-health system, which will ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the aging population of the island state, high rates of chronic diseases, and limitations of the system.
The funding to be made over the course of four years was decided after consulting the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges faced by the state.
The $325 million package also includes an optional surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help in resolving past collected cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-hospital care, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system," Ms. Plibursec said.
The Minister stressed that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain the current funding level to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month where additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is rendered in as effective and efficient manner as possible by the State.
Mr. Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean too much, "unless real improvements are made to take Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level."
Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought before the Prime Minister in early May."
I hope the federal aid package will be very helpful towards separating the state-wide public health system from the crisis-hit list," Mr Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional alternate processes will undo the major recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution."
We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You cannot treat the state government taking nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Niklaux of Dennis Diderot's novel details the finest production design and time period, but it has become much more than it should have been.
This novel, depicting the time of 1760, tells the sad story of Sujan, the young noble, whom his family members send to the convent.
When she revolts, she encounters extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluptuous paralytic Mother Superior, and becomes an object of erotic attraction to another.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, there is also a risk of making a boring film for the audience.
The Vice Chancellor of CSA, Dr. Munna Singh has decided to impose entrance fee in the garden due to the mess in the garden.
At the same time, a 15-day ultimatum has been given to rectify the poor condition of the departments.
The Vice-Chancellor conducted a surprise inspection of the Deputy Director Seeds and Fields and Director Research with the Garden Department at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including the director in these departments, absent from his seat.
After reprimanding, he warned to cut the salary if found absent the next time.
Dr Naushad Khan, media in-charge of the university, said that a pass of Rs 30 will have to be made for a month-long walk.

The system will work: The files related to various tasks in front of the vice-chancellor will be accessed under a system.
Every employee shall not have the right to file his/her own file and to enter the Vice-Chancellor's office.
The officials concerned will take the final to the vice-chancellor.
The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to build chemical weapons
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed important equipment to produce chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while fierce clashes have emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where toxic agents are believed to have been kept.
On Thursday, the Syrian movement group said about 120,000 people had been killed since the start of Syria's civil war, which began about three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization prescribed Dumcus to mix chemicals with all chemical weapon production units and toxic gases and to destroy or "impact" machinery used to fill in warheads.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, mainly, is a significant milestone in this ambitious event that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of 2014.
Destroying equipment means Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections present.
Syria is believed to have 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent sarin.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came at a time when there was an increase in conflict in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe is the chemical weapons production unit as well as the storage center.
The movement group, which details the number of dead through a network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of this, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government said 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 are fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hizbullah militants.
It also said there were 2,202 army fugitives among the dead and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
Due to this conflict, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's army fought rebels for weeks in Safira, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything clearly.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons, who, in a very short time frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said in a statement that its team is "satisfying and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's important production and mixing/filling equipment - destroyed."
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first phase of the confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers have been "abandoned and the chemical weapon product items placed there had been transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centres where the OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
In his remarks issued by the OPCW, Director General of the monitoring group, Ahmet Uzumku, said, "I salute the perseverance and courage displayed by you in completing the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken."
This civil war, which has been going on for three years, is primarily a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Alite sect, who came out of Shia Islam, and the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another development, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion at the air defense center in Latakia, Syria's coastal region, on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known.
The police have recovered photocopies of forged registry, forged seals, laptops and forged registry from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested accused were Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Habovel, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Guggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (East) has absconded from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with the clerk of the registrar office and recordkeeper Balbir Singh used to extract papers from the records of vacant and old land and then purchase new stamp papers and prepare a forged registry on them.
Not only that, he would then disappear the real registry and put it in the forged registry record.
The accused then sold the land on forged papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these forged papers.
After this, the real owner of the land used to continue to press the police and the administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry used to keep a special eye on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of the NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to sell by preparing a forged registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said during interrogation, the accused told that they have so far prepared around 150 forged registries.
According to the police, the gang leader Rajiv has already been booked for cheating and theft.
Protest against the conviction of a bomb blast plotter in Bali
The family and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bomb blast expressed outrage over the punishment given to the mastermind of the bomb blast, saying Omar Patek should face the firing team.
Patek, who ran for nearly 10 years as one of the most wanted individuals in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building an explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years on parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring a lot of people.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a series of bombings in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could also demand that this person, called the notorious "destroyer" as a bomb-making master person, be executed.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of the Perth-based woman June Courtney, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Withholding his tears, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished the same way as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms Courtine told the AAP, "He should be put in front of the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the club's nomenclature was lost after the explosion of a bomb loaded into a van parked outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar at the time of the explosion just 20 seconds before the explosive material-filled bagpack was detonated by suicide bombers.
He moved to a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and died three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as the other three members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre -- Amroji, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra -- who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of Bali bombings.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Pakistan's Abbottabad, where the U.S. military killed former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to restore contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
Ms. Courtine says, "She did not surrender."
Even today, she does not really have the pain of causing mental suffering to so many people.
The decision came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Ms Courtin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patek can still appeal against his punishment.
FAA: Aircraft passengers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but cannot call from cell phone)
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate, but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - this is under the highly-predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said how fast these changes are implemented will vary in each airline.
The airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meets the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices of their crew members to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement: "Based on the scheme status, we can very quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected to not turn on the aircraft until it reaches a height of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane lands, and not turn on until the plane is completely disembarked.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to use the device at the time of boarding, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed these changes.
When the policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are bored feeling like "hall monitors."
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited by connecting the Internet at heights below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there's still no conversation with friends, an online Scrabble-like game, the famous phenomenon associated with which is that when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the airport in 2011, and when he was refused to turn off the device, American airlines dropped him off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their bouncing will worry about injury to the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The Federal Communications Commission has regulatory powers relating to phone calls, not the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transportation Safety Board, a CBS News national transport safety expert, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially disrupt navigation-related devices, but also because they can disrupt cell phone towers when they are in the air.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the issue has last month recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
The FAA has been under increasing pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
The enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions on how to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when it received a report of disruption of navigation and communication equipment caused by passengers carrying FM radios and high-technology gadgets at the time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been proposing the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much less power radio transmission than the previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a nominal transmission during the page reversal.
But transmissions are dominant when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of those who favor reducing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into airlines and flew them to test for problems but found no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks posed by the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
The other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the disruption by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
The committee members, however, recommended that the FAA allow the pilot to order passengers to switch off the device at the time of landing of the aircraft in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common sense facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said: We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that the passenger traveling with pleasure is not incompatible with safety and security.
Learning from the series of bomb blasts in Patna, the UT Police has geared up for the celebration of Diwali in view of the security situation and for quick response during the time of emergency.
A total of 1800 soldiers, including vehicles, will be patrolling all the main places in the city, crowded markets and other places to ensure smooth running of traffic, prevention of spate incidents, and to teach lessons to the people involved.
These jawans will include women police personnel including PCR, traffic unit.
Police personnel and commandos will be vigilantly checking duty records at hotels, guest houses and other places including PGs.
The police have directed the SHO to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
The DSP has also been entrusted with the responsibility of conducting investigations in markets, malls and other places including VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and Diwali festival, high officials have also fixed the duty of additional policemen in the police control in view of the convenience of the people.
The police have asked the fire department and the staff of the department, including the Director of PGI, Principal Director and DHS, Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management, besides other dispensaries to keep high alert during the emergency time.
To teach a lesson to the mantles, the departmental officers have now put women police personnel and others on duty by naming them as 'anti punk staff' led by the NGO.
The police personnel of the Anti Gunda staff team will be caught in plain clothes, crowded places including markets.
On Diwali, all the SHOs have been ordered to install 44 nakas in the interiors of the city.
Police personnel will also be present at 38 naka points on the city borders.
The bird was released back into the forest by air transport for protection from the North Sea Rig
The bird found lying on the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the forest by air transport from the coast.
This water rail was sent to Aberdeen by a helicopter before the Scottish SPCA recovered the bird back to their Eloa-based rescue center.
Center manager Colin Sedan said: "This water rail was probably the winter migratory bird of northern Europe, hit by strong winds over the North Sea."
The bird seemed tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The water rail had become healthy and healthy before it was released.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for Britain was launched in April and a pledge was taken to bring the business together and determine what changes the UK's employment and prosperity creators want to see in our relationship with the EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders, representing the UK's business size, regions and locations.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to a lot of people.
We found that a large portion of businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not get entangled in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked his views on specific policy areas, from monopolies regulation to product legislation, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
Common dissatisfaction with the single market could be seen very easily, with businessmen saying that the price of the regulation of Brussels is much higher than the benefits of being part of Europe's business sector - even of the vast businessmen who were traditionally favored by European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part of the UK clearly wants to move on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of key business groups, showed that businessmen are driving a "meaningful change" that would give the UK back its lost power.
It has a very high price - the treaty change for Britain and the issue of getting a better deal changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of remaining in the EU in the referendum.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: this survey shows that UK businessmen support his plan to negotiate the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect the current balance of power to be re-negotiated by making a meaningful change in favor of the UK.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming inevitable very quickly, as the eurozone is moving forward in the direction of the bound economy and the fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businessmen it means a new focus on business and fundamental changes in the regulation methodology of Brussels.
Gazprom's Alexey Miller calls the pipeline in Bulgaria the start of a new round
The head of Gazprom said the start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
Today has been a historic event: Construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline began, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security across the European continent.
The South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that a dispute concerning the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where Russia's gas is the majority of Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the end of the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream once the entire project is operationalized in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Prior to the allegations against Caringbah child care employee Jonathan Lord in 2011, two YMCANSW employees have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never reported a case of child sexual harassment within its organisation," the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about a case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Carringbah Jim Instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare, a lawyer assisting the commission, told Gail Furness that he was aware of the first case, but did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that the "outer investigation of YMCA has been carried out and they have found YMCA to be at the forefront of child safety" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it achieved the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed because of Lord's appointment "including myself", and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations to inform them of child safety policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during a two-year term at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in the YMCA, due to which the employees did not report child safety violations by Lord.
What the employees saw about the breach was evidence that Lord spent time alone with the children, getting them babysitting, holding them in his lap, telling them that he loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and asked for child safety training, as she was concerned about his behavior, testified that YMCA Caringbah, who supervised Lord's child service manager, was "very intimidating and difficult to meet most of the time."
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW Board that, the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not reporting."
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement was taken by the YMCA Child Services General Manager, Liam Whiteley, shortly after the allegations surfaced.
He said the aim was to avoid mixing of evidence, but it was "overzealous" and not executed correctly.
Stephen Smallbone, special professor of child sexual abuse at Griffith University, said that YMCANSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "serious problems" in the appointment, monitoring, induction, training and supervision of the employees.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview taken at night to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
Having stepped down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely refrained from discussing British politics while limiting most of his comments to his role as representative of foreign affairs and Middle East group peace founders.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister's post, Mr Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but that's unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts who performed horse for the best horse of the year at Cardiff gathered, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not yet in school and just a few months away from taking his first steps, this little boy and his pet Shetland pony Taffy easily completed three steps and received the top prize - he surpassed his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudy near Cardiff, the uncanny pair — which is just as tall as Sk — was highly praised for its appearance, behavior and style.
In front of the men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, he slanted his flat cap at an unblemished angle and circled his two-year-old toffee to the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural skills of controlling which is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has practiced with this pony from Shetland daily since then.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Phenton and Toffee are fantastic couples."
He had to face a challenge from all the candidates, but they both won the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most different in this theatre, he all felt so amazing that he wanted to take a photo with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Ab Well, South Wales, is walking on the footprints of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: "The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was rejoicing and clapping."
He was running on the sand all over the color field, and despite his appearance so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is a madman of animals - he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he has raised two chickens that he takes care of.
The kind of start he's made will be in the best horse exhibition of the very first year - and I'm sure he'll do very well.
Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his pony," said a spokesman for the annual horse exhibition.
They are a very good pair.
The decision makers gave points considering the way Fenton and Toffee performed and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between the pony and its rider - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring in this case.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's cute clothes helped him, he really looked very different.
The "renovation" of the pleading Chinese newspaper will be
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to leave a reporter guilty of defamation will be renovated, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express had made a sparse public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongjou.
But then Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated news about a state-owned company.
The regulator said that now New Express has to go through a "complete reform".
The order for "improvement" came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
A preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published a lot of false news about listed company Zoomlion in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
It said it had decided to impose "an administrative penalty by cancelling the license of Chen Yongjou's reporter."
It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete revamp of the New Express, recommending a thorough investigation of the people responsible for it in the New Express and an immediate revision of the New Express leadership team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After his detention, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, saying he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came to state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people's trust," he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a homepage apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, a number of high-profile suspects have made TV broadcast faults-acceptance.
Experts say that from time to time the conviction is carried out forcefully, despite the fact that in the second half of this year a law prohibited authorities from forcing a person to blame themselves.
Shri Hanuman Chalisa will be recited by Shri Maninderjit Singh Bitta, National President of the Anti-Terrorism Front along with 10 thousand children in the lesson of Shri Hanuman Chalisa to be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass on 23rd November by the Shri Hindu Bench of Justice.
This information was given by Bitta to the gathering after the Chief Spokespersons of Shri Hindu Nyay Peeth Praveen Dang and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma invited him to recite Hanuman Chalisa.
He praised the effort of Shri Hindu Nyaya Peeth to connect children with Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to give religious education to children including worldly education.
Self-railway found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
U.S. officials have described the four-feet-fold three-feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes discovered so far.
The tunnel is equivalent to the crumbling length of about six football pitches, connecting Tijuana, a warehouse near Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said it had been stopped before a drug from passing through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were said to be working as drivers, were charged with possessing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, he can be sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Smuggling in Nogles, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the Central Mexico marijuana crop, which presents the challenge of drug mafia groups competently how to deliver the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 700-yard route equipped with rail tracks, extending from a Tijuana home kitchen to San Diego warehouses.
Congress candidate for the assembly constituency, Sarhul Ram Bhagat, filed his nomination.
Besides the BJP and the Congress, seven candidates, including one and two independents from the National People's Party, filed their nominations on Thursday.

British police sends extradition notice to Assange
The British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has requested for shelter.
The Scotland Yard said they had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, as well as said he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual offences charges, as well as his options under British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against the extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand him over to the U.S., fearing he had requested asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
The Scotland Yard has sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose," a spokesman said.
He is in breach of his bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice being served.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks' anti-privacy website, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.
1000 pounds (£1,000) fine for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph with hot drinks between legs
The driver has been fined 1,000 pounds (£1,000) for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Tiptree, 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Essex, was spotted running his Mercedes Benz on A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
Howie in the Colchester Magistrates Court has admitted an indictment of negligent driving.
Seven points were added to their license, as a result of which they have been banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (£90) and a victim surcharge of 100 pounds (£100).
Tax on foreign property owners to end London's artificial situation
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget, offered a stamp duty of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds, and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than a separate one.
The stamp duty from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelasa in the year 2012/13 was 708 million pounds, which is already higher than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook pointed out: "After the increase in stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property has less than fair tax, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system.
He added that "but this move could make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell to current owners"
Prime property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market by price in wealthy south-west London, which spans from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Savills research, the prices of central London continued to rise by 5.6 per cent each year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market", as the city's south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) witnessed a surge.
Scientists have further highlighted the relationship between dog tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs shake their tail more to the right (from a dog's point of view), while restless dogs shake their tails more primarily to the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
The neuroscientist Professor Georgia Wellertiga from the University of Trento explained: "All that is well known in humans is that the left and right parts of the brain are involved differently in the stimulus that generates positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that even the right part of the brain in dogs, like humans, was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the sidewalk shaking by other dogs, researchers tracked down animals watching other dogs' movies.
He measured the heart beats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It may not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
We introduced dogs with dog films - in the realistic version or in the shade-picture to deal with other issues that get confused, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right.
When the animals saw a sentimental dog waving his tail to the right (from a dog's point of view), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail changing direction mainly to the left (from the dog's point of view), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellarttigra, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these acts.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience what they should be concerned about and what they shouldn't.
He said: "If you've met other dogs several times, and if they constantly shake their tails to one side it's related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
Researchers say that these findings can provide owners, veterinarians, and trainers with better information about animal emotions.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this is not the first study to check if the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was shaken to the left than to the right, dogs were more likely to get closer to it rather than be restless."
He said the difference was because dogs in various studies were not fully dogging animals or robot dogs in films.
He made it clear that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help.
While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be found - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we may not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic monkeys postpone Glasgow gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock bank called Arctic Monkeys has postponed gigs in Glasgow after its lead singer suffered from throatitis.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city on Friday.
But his major singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to reschedule the show's date.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were obliged to postpone gigs in the LG Arena in Birmingham in a similar manner on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: After taking medical advice, after the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight, Arctic Monkeys will have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 1, Friday as well.
In the investigation Alex Turner was found to have had throatitis, and they are sadly not able to perform."
The show will now take place on November 20 at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and the show will take place on November 21 at Glasgow Hydro.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience caused to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service at the box office from which you purchased the tickets.
Pope Francis to announce first cardinal's name in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis would form the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking pastors in the Catholic Church, with only positions below the pope, and these are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help him choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the Pope's election after they reach the age of 80 - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardy said that before the ceremony of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the pope-sabha.
Pope Francis has already decided to inform his decision to hold the Pope-Council of February, so that it becomes easier to plan other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal voters was likely to decrease by February.
He said that in general, the number of cardinal electors is as low as 120, as many cardinals, and the names of cardinals over 80 years of age as they wish.
Valero said the next year's pope gathering will be important, as it will be the first pope gathering since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
It will be interesting to see if the new Pope, to restore balance, also nominate cardinals from the rest of the world.
South America has forty percent of Roman Catholics, but their numbers are very low in cardinals.
The Cardinals' Council by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose task is to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first cardinal to be elected after it has been formed.
Before this, the Pope used to decide all things on his own.
At the moment, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him," Valero said.
He said it was possible to ask Francis Cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's all new.
Valero said that the Pope usually gives the bishops of large places the position of cardinal, but Francis was "totally surprised - so we don't know whose name they will declare."
GM recalls pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct seatback
According to an information from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday, the General Motors company has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in the hand-twisting seatback in its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sera pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result the seatback failed to comply with the Union Auto Safety Standards about Head Restrant.
According to an information posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website, "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head restrant may not be able to properly protect the driver, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recall models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began to be shipped in June and reflect the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker since the 2009 bankruptcy renewal.
GM had told truck owners about the defect in late October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown that disrupted auto sales growth in October.
GM said on Friday that the sales of silverado and sera trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silverados and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
GM shares were up 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
Obama's voters are disappointed
I voted for Obama twice in the hope of a change.
He says Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP's policy of obstruction
The policy of interception can not excuse the troubles of the Obamacare website, drone attacks
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of things that could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during my second year of medical school and will give me a ray of hope.
Its name is "The Dare to Win", and it is a souvenir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get tired of my patients' prescriptions at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions of people and speeches could hold your breath.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a pause to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they found.
A group of young visionary men were on their way to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
During Obama's presidency in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 per cent.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from a dream world.
Those days of hope are hard to remember - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
It really changed after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I couldn't imagine any of this.
I owe Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, to the end of the "don't ask" and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Further, I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented many efforts to advance our country: including immigration reform, public options for healthcare, closure of bases on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the innumerable times in which I took the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I ended up having the answer that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to foreign leaders' espionage, nor to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency collecting data about the private lives of ordinary U.S. citizens nor to prosecute those who expose the wrongful acts of the government.
It cannot explain the reason for the killing of American citizen Anwar El Alawaki without a trial, nor the diminishing public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says attempts by the White House to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration so far."
And most recently, it cannot give an excuse for the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law under the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I expected that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is evident that the elected office is not a predictable route, as the anti-political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet the examples I have cited above mostly seem to have been chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice, which did not seem to dictate his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember his lost promises.
A portion of the book was reading this week, describing how Clinton had suffered huge losses due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to return to the track, and remain truthful on their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We must remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claimed that PM Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave plan
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave plan as his daughters can get pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in controversy over the payment of a carbon tax bill of $6 million, has claimed that while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes are reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
He may have a significant interest conflict in terms of the parental leave granted, because if any of his daughters becomes pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they get a leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after he fell again.
Mr. Palmer sought the restoration of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aot's daughters Franz and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come two months after we have voted?
We should have a better system.
Why can't we have a system in which we fill in our details on the computer, vote instantly and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
That's because if someone doesn't like him, can they erase him?
The use of pencils in today's time seems absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting, and has recently released a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new work "very seriously."
Public office is meant for public service.
We don't need any other awards other than the history awards that we can serve the community at this crucial time," he said.
This caused problems to the litigants.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the increasing attacks on advocates and their families prove that criminals have become careless.
They have no fear of police and administrative system.
Referring to such incidents in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, the case received this information from two people, another indication that the global investigation carried out by regulators in suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world's largest financial market, which accounts for $5.3 trillion each day.
Both these traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation of the case appears to be a repetition of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation into the matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators."
Last month, scientists from the case said RBS had sent emails and instant messages from the former trader to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from its current position as the European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on holiday last week, while Barclays and UBS, former senior currency trader, were suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Scientists from the case said Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after Swiss regulator Finma reported that it was investigating the suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority Viko, the Department of Justice in the FCA, the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of bankers being duped for their favorable fluctuations in the currency market.
Those familiar with the matter said HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received a request for information on behalf of regulators.
Banks are closely examining instant messages and emails equal to several years in search of clues to an incorrect activity.
News about the investigation has created panic among traders in the sector who have been among the top gainers in the investment banks trading unit for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, as the opportunities for speculators have been reduced due to low volatility in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of their own platform by banks despite the enormous volume of foreign exchange buying and selling means "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced his retirement this week from his exchange-traded funds desk in London, which had made a loss of about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, "We believe that the trader acted alone, and has been controlled."
Students studying in technical and management courses running in the campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice-Chancellor of the University has written to the Governor for permission to hold elections.
With the commencement of the admission process in the university, there was a demand for holding student union elections.
He had also launched a signature campaign for the selection of his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Students who have taken admission in around two dozen courses including B.Tech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science running on the campus will be able to choose their representatives this year.
More than six thousand students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Prof. Ashok Kumar said that the Governor has sought permission to hold elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as the permission is granted.
It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges.
Many college managements do not want student union elections to take place on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are not being held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Coordinator ABVP
After Deepawali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
There is also a problem with the college's view on student union elections being not clear.
People have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from utensils in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the past year.
There was a crowd of people in jewellery shops in Shimla.
A large crowd was also seen in the utensils shops from the lower market to the Malrod.
Even though inflation was on the rise this year, people still did not show any weakness in buying on auspicious occasions.
On Friday, the auspicious muhurat for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and from 1:56 am to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 am to 8:12 pm.
At the time of these three muhurats, a large crowd of people gathered in the suburbs, including Shimla, to buy more.
In the Shimla Lower Market, people did not find a place to sit on foot.
In every small shop, the crowd was like that.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, celebrated as the Trayodashi Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama healthcare law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared healthcare law in the name of Barack Obama as constitutional.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act, which would require citizens to buy or pay health insurance before 2014 and that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other moderate members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court has also supported the remaining articles of the 2700-page law, saying that the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or they will lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally subversive.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business to stop this law.
The law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates during the early 2012 session, including the pro-choice nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the greatest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth, Kuber and Yamaraj, the god of death.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings for money are good and bad.
There can be nothing more valuable than the wealth that works for the welfare of humanity, but the wealth that causes arrogance does not make sense.
We earn money for the holy purpose and spend it for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of this should also be the feeling of spending on society, but the tendency to collect or earn yen-cane-type money in an unaccounted way destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also be the basis of one's living.
We all have to think for many people in society who are living in a terrible absence.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the Purushtharans of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and fame and according to their efforts, they also receive wealth and fame.
The same wealth is durable with which respect is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he can neither consume it properly nor be useful to anyone else.
If someone else has money, don't be jealous of him.
The true rich is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of wealth.
No one can use money more than creating employment for others.
One more thing, money is not just money.
It would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the master of this money.

Special Judge IS Mehta, after hearing the case in the closed room, has accepted the NIA's plea and sent Ahmed to 14-day remand.
According to sources, while presenting Ujair Ahmed before the court, the NIA said Ujair Ahmed, the main accused in the Patna serial blasts, was mainly involved in the incident along with Indian Mujahideen members Imtiaz Ansari and Haider.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
The NIA, through Ahmed's interrogation, also wants to arrest other accused in the case.
In this case, the bomb-making material and the terrorists who made it are yet to be searched.

A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that the PMT of 2012 was fake.
The STF has found fault with the roll number of 700 students in the probe.
Out of these, 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students can be cancelled.
After the disclosure of STF, the medical education department has started churning to cancel the admission of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to meet the STF.
A list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this matter.
Departmental officials say that it has been a year since the students took admission in 2012, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
With the matter being confined to STF investigations, the medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam operator Tarun Pithora said if the STF submits the list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be cancelled immediately.
Meanwhile, Director Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students have not refused to cancel their admission if found to be correct.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in the PMT of the year 2012 are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students in the PMT exam held in 2013.

The MLA said that a large number of people keep coming and going in the gurdwara, but the water cooler has been installed here due to lack of proper arrangement of drinking water.
This will allow people to get cold water during the summer.
Pure plain water will be available during the winter season.
This will remove the problem of drinking water to the visiting devotees.
Other members of the Gurudwara Committee were also present on the occasion.
After the general election, if the new government continues the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene sales are to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the Northeast are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two grounds.
The first is the rapid generation of electricity connections in rural areas.
The second basis is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most of the rural families have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made adequate preparations in this regard.
PDS kerosene sales in Delhi have already stopped since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand have been significantly reduced in kerosene quota.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilolitres to 1 lakh kilolitres.
Haryana's kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 per cent, while Uttarakhand's allocation was reduced by 70 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there has been no news of kerosene shortage from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price difference between PDS kerosene and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This will encourage adulterers.
In states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore.
The accused used to fraudulently open investors' accounts by referring to the trading firm in the name of share buying and selling.
Perhaps for the first time in the state, such disclosures have revealed a fraud of crores of rupees.
Who is the leader of the gang, the police have not been able to reach him at the moment, but seven people, including the accused who saw his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang used to operate a fake commodity market named Metatrader-5.
The company's employees used to collect cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
This led to the buying of shares of investors being seen by the accused.
It was known at what price the stock was bought.
In fact, no shares were bought and there was no transaction for this, because no demat account of investors was opened and the shares were shown as false on this fake software.
The police are suspecting that hundreds of people have been involved in the gang.
In the name of giving profit to every investor, investments were made from two to five lakh rupees.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his six other associates have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Doual, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can conduct stock trading through its own investors.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but the company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor got the stock trading done.
This company bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of WinTrade.
Since then, people have been cheated in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight traders from Indore have come forward to complain to the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profits, their money was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started asking for the profit amount from the company's employees.
Investors are even saying that on the fake ID given to them, the price of their purchased shares was always shown to be low.
This price was decided by the accused at their level.
The company has appointed its CEOs and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents advised people to join this company by offering them more profits.
After this, two lakhs were deposited from someone up to five lakhs rupees.
On the day of the Test, the players of this team keep creating new records and now their status in the ODI also seems to be increasing gradually.
A great example of this was also seen on Thursday when a good New Zealand team was beaten by Bangladesh in the ODI series and won the title.
Sohag Gazi and Mashrafemurtaza led Bangladesh to an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, beating New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODI cricket.
Earlier, New Zealand lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing a target of 248 runs for Bangladesh, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals in front of the spin of Gazi (34/3) and the storm bowling of Murtaza (43/3), which piled up the team for 207 runs in 46.4 overs.
For New Zealand, Ross Taylor scored 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37.
Kyle Mills not out 27, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but no batsman from the team could convert a good start into a big innings which led to the loss of the team.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 runs in 49 overs despite Tamim Iqbal (58).
Anderson and James Neesham took eight wickets together.
Anderson took four for 40, while Neesham took four for 53.
Tamim has become Bangladesh's highest run-scorer in ODIs.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3702 runs in 124 matches.
The third and final match of the series will be played in Fatullah on Sunday.

Punjab State Power Corporation is earning crores of rupees per day in the Hall City Circle Office Ruin Building.
In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accident.
There is an atmosphere of panic among the staff working from the roofs of this building due to falling cement.
Built in 1913 in the British era, this building was the first municipal corporation office.
In 1995, the building was handed over to the Electricity Board.
In the name of repairing it, the department is doing away with it only by coloring it.
The condition of the building is so bad that the employees are afraid to sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that often the plaster falls off the roofs.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, launched a sharp attack on the Congress while addressing an election meeting on Friday.
Modi said, "In many states and at the centre of the country, there was a coalition government, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a Communist government, sometimes a BJP government."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the team do?
If there is a comparative result, then there will be no question of whether the BJP government should come.
Whenever there is a BJP government, there has been an effort to fulfil the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness that inflation was low in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals.
But when the Congress government was formed or supported by it, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what he has done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country are not able to reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
The elections are of the Lok Sabha, you should answer to the people.
Attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, "Today, questions are being asked to Modi. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, then every year, they will present their work to the public.
In a democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, a servant should sit.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves there.
Congressmen leave the balloon every day.
Congress friends, we have already given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people try.
In the case of Nortel Patent, an economic lawsuit is filed on Google, Samsung, Huawei.
Thousands of former Nortel patent-owned groups have filed a number of patent lawsuits on Thursday against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had overtaken in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, an association that bought Nortel patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said these patents also include the technology that combines the words searched on the Internet with the relevant advertisement, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make these phones, which run on Google's Android operating system, which is tougher than Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google finally proposed $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment stated that "Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suit in the auction"
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is infringing.
Believed in the first president freely elected in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has sworn in as his successor, but his Victory Day could hardly put an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi, who succeeded Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago, promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first elected Islamic president of the Arab world, and the fifth head of state of Egypt, after being ousted nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on the banks of the Nile in front of the 18 judges of the court with a black cloak on his chair, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and another republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony featured in live broadcasts on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception as an unlawfully declared organization, and which has been the target of previous governments, the party's U.S.-trained engineer 60-year-old Morsi said that "today the Egyptians have laid the foundation of a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building and arrived at Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to greet the new president, apart from the President's fanfare since the Mubarak period, traffic was also stopped for a short time, so that his motorcade would normally leave the busy road, which connects the city centre to its south suburbs.
Morsi, who was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "empty tire" of the Brotherhood, had a great rise in his personal reputation after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him as a candidate not just for Islamist but for all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against dictatorial Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Egypt is a citizen, a national, a constitutional and modern nation today."
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his inaugural speech.
They were officially welcomed by the military band playing the national tune, while they stood in the pose of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed him with the slogan "Army and people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a bastion of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath at Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and took an oath to withdraw the presidential powers taken from his post by the military council from the leader who was removed last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court rather than by customaryly taking the competent oath of parliament they bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases U.S. espionage has exceeded the limit.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's acceptance came during his address to the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in an attempt to gain information, in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also made a dent in the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on the NSA by 4 votes against 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on one-time phone tapes under the US Patriot Act.
Under FISA, knowingly collecting unauthorized data and its use will be considered a crime and a provision of ten years imprisonment has been made for it.
The bill will become law once both the Houses of Congress pass the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has made a significant contribution to the country's security, said Senator Diane Festin, chairman of the committee.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in.
Moreover, the safety of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have backed the bill, angry over the disclosure of the NSA's internet surveillance program.
In a letter to senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who have curbed the NSA's massive phone recording.
It is worth noting that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the NSA's actions.
The international community has been outraged after the NSA revealed the surveillance of telephone conversations of heads of state from 35 countries, including Germany and France.

So you used to think travel agents of the past century, say thank you to the internet?
The flight center is pushing this trend forward.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full year-round profit before tax to range between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million in the previous forecast.
If the target is achieved as per the current guidance, it will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase in the record $290.4 million profit achieved in the year 2011/12.
Graham Turner, managing director, said the flight center has made a profit of 8 percent in the first half, and has made a good start in its second half, especially in Australia and the UK in non-commercial travel.
So far, 10 of our countries are in profits, and many countries are on track to record full-year income before interest and tax contributions," he said.

A recent media report said that the NSA blew up information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has revealed this based on documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's programme was named Muscular, which it ran in association with its British Counter Part-GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data passing through Yahoo and Google's vast fiber optic cable network.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 as saying that more than 18 crore documents were collected within three days of the start of the program.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside the US, as court orders are required for such campaigns in the US.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying: As far as I am aware, this has never happened.
The NSA has always gathered all the information within the ambit of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted at spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations on Wednesday said the U.S. administration has assured that its communication system will not be monitored.
The US has also said that the UN communication system is not monitored.

Schools were pleased to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story since 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage more and more reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of them will be the first subjects to undergo revolutionary changes.
It will also change to other main topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam regulator will display changes in the structure of GCSE with offical, new grading system, and reduced syllabus.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove had said that there was "a great consensus that, in order to restore the trust of the people, we need to improve our examination system", adding that "GCSE will be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours a week during sessions compared to most countries.
Australian schools provide students 143 hours a year on average, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that being combined for overweight with subjects in the comprehensive Mathematics GCSE-League table was likely to encourage providing additional teaching in schools.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems" including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot tell the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
The counsel for Asaram said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that you can use.
The lawyer said that there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular, which makes them more troublesome.
These people are damaging his image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told the lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Facing opposition questions at the rail gate, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in a position to say that he had not looked at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised as to where the woman's talk came from in the middle.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a corporator.
Turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to lodge a complaint against a woman who was not successful in the last parliamentary election.
Speaking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had already questioned him in the railway bribery case.
If they were made witnesses in the matter, would they have been made only after thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam that he is talking about, he had written a letter only to a needy person.
If this is their sin, they will always do it.
He said though the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak out.
As far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development works, he said.
These people cannot even think about the way Chandigarh is developing or is going to happen.
In the cabinet meeting, greetings were exchanged between the two.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for the counter-attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan camp.
He also said that there is no other emotion in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges must be tackled.
There was also a feeling on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech positively.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to give respect to the workers in the Chintan camp and protect them from alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he is also ready to be dismissed from the cabinet to speak his mind.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of fresh consideration in the matter of sitting the workers in government posts.
In the camp, state JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the announcement of the nomination of workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will check the list at his own level.
They will also examine whether the MLAs-MPs have been consulted in making the list.
If needed, there will be a massive reshuffle in the list to give space to the old and committed workers.
Legislators and MPs allege that they were not taken into account in making the list of nominations.
The names of those who came from other parties after a long time have been recorded in the list, while many important activists who have been active since the days of the Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person also has the name of Late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher at a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The five children of the family include Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to quit his studies only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially in his childhood.
At this time they used to set up a bhajjiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
On Dhirubhai's first job, he arrived in Yemen's Aden city in 1949 from a ship named Cabota at the age of 17.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to the country.
In 1955, he went to Mumbai to try luck with Rs 500 in his pocket.
And that's where his business journey began.
From here Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back again.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his Sultanate.
Like the father, today the name of these two brothers is also among the international level businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

It is going to be expensive to kill mosquitoes to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquids used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal to raise taxes will be placed before the cabinet soon.
The government, which is facing a financial crisis, is looking for every possible way to increase earnings these days.
It is worth mentioning that the resource committee under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan remains to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, out of several proposals to raise taxes at the recent resource committee meeting, the committee rejected those which had a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has cleared a proposal to raise taxes on mosquito repellents, quails, mats and liquids.
It is proposed to triple the tax on them.
Currently, they have four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax.
They are now subject to 12.50 per cent VAT and 1.50 per cent additional tax.
The government is expected to get an additional revenue of about Rs 14 crore.
While the Department of Commerce has been in favour of raising the tax on the Tendu leaf from five per cent to 14 per cent to increase the tax revenue income, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that the Tendu leaf is used to make the beedi that the lower strata of people drink.
Similarly, the committee has not yet given a green signal to increase the tax on transmission wire, electrical goods, etc., saying that this may affect the general public due to the cost of electricity.
The committee has also not accepted the proposal to impose a green tax on renewal of commercial vehicles.
Congress leader Chadveer Hooda held public relations in Sector 21 and village Maheshpur on Friday.
During this time, people were invited to the rally and also assigned responsibilities.
Chadveer has also fixed the duties of the workers.
Chadveer Hooda said that an amount of crores of rupees has been spent by Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda in the district.

Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People's Democratic Party, has reportedly been removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been removed for political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Saeed, who won the 2002 election on PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet as Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said, I have got a security cover since 1996.
I live in an area called the stronghold of terrorists.
A security squad of CRPF was posted at my house under the supervision of Sub Inspector.
I also have bodyguards with me, but all my security was suddenly withdrawn on Thursday.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he said he would investigate the matter.
However, when IGP Kashmir Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted in this context, he denied the information about the matter and said it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my knowledge.
This is a very serious matter if the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir coming in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure as Prime Minister (between 1999 and 2004), there came a time when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre tall Statue of Unity in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Before this, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said the BJP's PM candidate does not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA had not been able to bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversary and death anniversary of Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary and death anniversary, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about the difference, he said, "It should not be looked at from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, which those who oppose are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, security arrangements have been made on all sides in view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna again.
The police conducted a thorough investigation into the routes and meeting places of Modi's visit.
The people who attend the meetings will be monitored by the police.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will monitor the security.
Modi's security will be further tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are also being raised about the BJP's bone urn journey taken out of the Patna blasts.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP is trying to disturb the atmosphere.
Proceed through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare to the rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend
West African countries do not have too many physicians; there is only one physician for 5000 people
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote to make a CNN year hero for them or for someone in the other top 10.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to his senses and faint, going to the hospital, which was not reasonably convenient to assist him.
Jaimell Well was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital, Yonde, in 1981.
Initially he had only broken his hand, but an infection that spread to his brain, and he created the hemorrhoids, which affected the rest of his life.
There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Wel took his father to a highly crowded clinic and hospitals and received whatever treatment he could.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. hoping that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but that doesn't happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people may end up waiting in the mouth of death.
The situation did not change much since Wel's father's death in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5000 people.
If compared, there is a physician for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for about two-thirds of the healthcare expenditure in the country.
Their only problem is poverty," says Well.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the sufferings of his father and his countrymen, Vel took a firm resolve to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He also became a doctor himself, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Wayanad.
And they launched the non-profit organization Eskowim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped about 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the ceiling and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they get a truly heroes' honor: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
The free medical service in these villages is really a reason to celebrate, and wells - with their big smiles and endless energy - are happily included.
The next morning his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
We're meeting 500 people on each trip," Well said.
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates - this document is needed in school, but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out at school buildings, town halls, or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes operation rooms and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers wake up early on Sunday morning to work.
It is a waist-breaking motion, but the village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work," Welle said.
On Sunday their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group — which includes Cameron's physicians and foreign medical students — has had 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world for the people they help.
One person reported that he would be able to go to work again as he received free hernia surgery.
That person said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works at a private medical clinic around Wynde at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer at Well's group, said, "I don't know when they sleep."
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never achieve in their own country.
We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgical procedures in which we help to capture tools for Dr. Well or clear blood stains," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the US, you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students usually spend from their own to reach Cameroon, and they often come up with medical supplies for donations.
But when they arrive, they go and stay, and pay for the instructions.
There's no doubt they're heroes," O'Malley says.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same workload, there is no difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise they made to their father, these are the things that give them great joy.
I am very happy when I do this work," says Well.
And I think of my father.
I hope they are watching what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

You may not believe it, but it is true.
Not only this, the mission road has been named after the city council president Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express its displeasure over some bad roads in the city.
The event was led by JMM's Union Secretary Sachchidanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and he has a government, yet he needs a response from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the public.
Clearly, Modi was responding to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not speak to journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to have a face-to-face debate.
I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present the report to the people every year," Modi said.
The Congress has given tickets to all the old MLAs again.
The list includes 6 old and 2 new faces.
In the new faces, Nirmala Sapre from Bina assembly constituency in Sagar district and Pratapsinh Lodhi from Jabera assembly constituency in Damoh district have been given an opportunity.
Three from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been re-elected.
As expected, Govind Singh Rajput from Surabhi in Sagar, Arunoday Chaubey from Khurai, Narayan Prajapati from Banda have been re-elected.
In Tikamgarh, Yadavendra-Singh from Tikamgarh and Brijendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikram Singh Nati Raja from Rajnagar in Chhatarpur have been given tickets.
All of them are existing MLAs in these areas.
After the first list of the BJP and the Congress, there will be a contest between the new faces from both the parties in Bina.
In Bina, BJP's Mahesh Rai and Congress' Nirmala Sapre are facing each other.
The sitting Congress MLA Brijendra-Singh Rathore in Prithvipur, Tikamgarh, will face Anita Nayak, wife of former minister late Sunil Naik.
The present MLA of Rajnagar, Vikramsinh Nati, will challenge the Raja to the BJP's Ramkrishna Kusmariya.
BJP MLA Arunoday Chaubey and BJP MP Bhupendra Singh are facing each other from Khurai.
BJP's youth leader Parul Sahu is contesting against BJP MLA Govind Rajput.
He has been placed in the state-level election operations and reception committees in the assembly elections.

Because of this, worship has been given an important responsibility.
RDA Chairman Sunil Soni, who has been a contender from the North seat, has been given the responsibility of conducting the elections for Raipur South seat.
Another contender, Municipal Chairman Sanjay Srivastava, has been placed in the provincial reception committee.
He will help the party's star campaigner, national leaders, to come and go.
The committee also has some other ticket contenders, including Sony.
Shyam Baisrang and Leelaram Bhojwani will conduct the election of Rajnandgaon seat.
During this time, the association organized a colourful programme.
In the Diwali programme, singer Harguna put four moons in the beauty of the ceremony with his songs.
During the Diwali celebrations under the leadership of Bar President Pradip Saini, judges, Bar Association office bearers and lawyers were present.
District and Sessions Judge Harminder Singh Madan said that festivals of all religions should be celebrated together in the country.
Bar President Pradeep Saini said that all festivals are celebrated every year by the Bar Association with no discrimination, reverence and gaiety.
Hundreds of devotees were present on the occasion.
Lord Hanuman was worshipped on the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti on the banks of Devika.
Advocate Surendra Khajuria said that on Friday, around 8 am, a havan-yagya was organized along with the worship of Lord Mahavira.
Havan started at 9 am and was given a full moon at around 12 am.
He said that a huge bhandara was organized after the Havan Yajna with the help of the residents of the city, in which people of every religion of the city took Prasad and received blessings.
Obama's healthcare proposal withdrawn
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama withdrew his often-repeated misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue with your health plan if you like it."
With millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Yesterday, Obama changed his true message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and have it useful, can continue to do it."
Speaking about the cancellation, which he calls a "whisper of news", Obama has been pleased to purchase new coverage in the market from US citizens who receive these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, as much money or a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaply than the proposed one.
You will get a better deal," he said.
The administration said it should be no surprise that 5% of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage does not conform to the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said that "I tell these American citizens directly" you deserve better than that."
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market from October has been "unfortunate".
I am as disappointed and angry as other people.
I want to get your trust again.
Sebelius said the sentence in anger to a fellow sitting behind him at a house hearing yesterday after a heated spat with the Republican, who was caught by a Mike. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be nominated to Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour-long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act, has not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.
The case of demanding a ransom of Rs 2 lakh from the merchant was exposed.

Attempts are being made to resolve the case registered with the help of Cyber Crime Cell.
Narendra Bahad (21), a resident of Ayodhya, is an electronics shop.
Someone called from different mobile numbers on their mobile between the 25th and 29th.
The caller demanded Rs 2 lakh as ransom.
For not giving up, Narendra has been threatened with death or raising his daughter.
Narendra did not take this threat seriously at first, but when the threat began to increase and the matter came to his daughter studying in class 12th, he was upset.
The family members are in fear.
A complaint was lodged on Thursday.
The accused have not been identified yet.
In view of the seriousness of the case, the help of the cyber crime cell is being taken.
Apart from this, MP Badal instructed the officials on the spot to solve the problems of the people by converging the relevant philosophy in the villages of Bhagiwandar, Bandar Patti, Laleana, J'Jal, Phullokhari, Gatwali and Malkana.
The MP also issued a grant for the development of the villages.
He ordered the panchayat to make proper use of the grant issued for the development of the villages so that the village residents could get the facilities. He took stock of the ongoing paddy procurement arrangements in village Bhagiwandar.
He gave one sewing machine, plants and certificates to 15 girls who have undergone sewing training.
During this time, 400 Congress and PPP in village Bhagiwandar, 35 Congress and PPP in Laleana and 71 families in village water joined SAD except Congress and PPP.
Badal said that due to the parameters laid down by the Centre regarding the procurement of paddy, the farmers of Punjab are being insulted in the mandis, while the Centre has always been biased against the farmers of Punjab.
He was accompanied by DC KK Yadav, SSP Ravacharan Singh Brar, ADC D Sonali Giri, ADC Rajeev Parashar, SDM Shruti Sharma, Talwandi Sabo area in-charge Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, administrative officers and Akali leaders of various departments.
As a result, cases of violation of the code of conduct have now come down.
Since the implementation of the model code of conduct on October 4, 313 cases were registered against various political parties till October 21.
Only 31 cases have been registered from October 22 to 27.
With the implementation of the election code of conduct, cases of its violation had also started coming up.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but gradually it has started to decrease.
It is being told that in the early days, there were more complaints against political parties due to lack of complete information about the code of conduct.
There are now fewer complaints coming from the Election Commission for sensitising political parties and taking lessons from the case registered.
Many parties were campaigning as before due to lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following this with information about the code of conduct.
This is also reducing cases of its violation.
A proposal in this regard has been sent by the ADA to the government, which is going to be sealed soon.
In this historic city surrounded by Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, there is no longer a plot on which ADA can make a big residential plan.
In such a situation, it has now made plans to plan a residential plan ahead of Jhunsi towards the east, Faphamau towards the north and Naini towards the south.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajasekhara to give a comprehensive look to this plan.
ADA has formed the idea of involving two hundred revenue villages of Phulpur, Soraon and Karchhana.
After coming under the ADA limit, the Chaka and Bahadur blocks will end.
At the same time, half of the area of Kaudihar block will also be merged with ADA.
According to ADA secretary Amarnath Upadhyay, a proposal has been sent to the government in this regard.
The ADA wants to take the boundary of these Gram Panchayats under its jurisdiction for planning, on which work will begin soon.

In the Ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still visiting the Ashram as before.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that U.S. espionage has "unreasonably gone too far"
John Kerry has hinted at the U.S.'s protective attitude to his surveillance program softening by accepting that sometimes its espionage "unreasonably goes too far."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty with Barack Obama for being on the "automatic pilot" as an insurgent disclosure towards whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's unfolding of espionage activities.
This revelation has brought the U.S. government into diplomatic turmoil in relations with its allies.
Speaking through a video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, I, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, it had potential in 9/11."
He has become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed its limits, but insists that no one's rights have been misused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone a long way inappropriately."
And the President is determined to make this clear to the people and is now conducting in-depth review so that there is no sense of abuse in any person.
I assure you that there is nothing wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that the NSA was, however, striving for a good purpose, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to killing people, killing them and attacking governments.
So what's the trouble if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have actually saved the plane from falling, demolishing buildings, and killing people as we have been able to know in advance about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the European Affairs Senate Subcommittee on Thursday said the U.S. lawmakers would visit Europe to help address concerns abroad about so-called U.S. espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats of his participation in counter-terrorism organisations due to frustration over surveillance by the national security agency.
It is really important for U.S. national security interests to have European countries with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," Murphy, the first-time Democrat elected and chairman of the European Affairs Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee, told Washington in an interview.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The NSA's record of millions of Europe's phone conversations has brought bitterness in relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the agency's chief said the news was not entirely correct, and showed the misunderstanding of the metadata shared by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the spying incident on the allies, saying it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the ruckus, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional visit that is likely to take place this year, and expressed hope that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other law makers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "impractical relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders, along with their people, will also have to be honest with their spying programs used for years.
Although we can revise our monitoring program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will address the conflict in Syria, Egypt and Iran, from the U.S. strategy to the U.S. surveillance activities.
A new politics of change has begun in the municipalities.
Recently, the Trinamool was converted into the board due to the defection of the Congress-led board councillors in the Santhia municipality of Veerbhum district.
This change occurred due to the inclusion of most of the Congress councillors in the Trinamool, including the chairman of the municipality.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also taken up the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers it a good sign for the party.
He said that 10 Congress corporators, including the chairman of the Santhia municipality Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some Left Front councillors, including CPI(M), have also held the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the number force, the Santhia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that all agree with the roadmap of Bengal's development under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI(M), CPI, and Forward Bloc are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The worthy leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
The TMC's takeover of the municipal board due to the defection of Congress councillors in the Santhia municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections is considered important in the political circles.
Earlier, the Left Front-ruled Haldia and the Nadia are also examples of the TMC occupying the Congress-ruled municipal board.
When the TMC takes over the municipal board in the districts due to the defections, those who join the party are given a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to break away from other parties and join the TMC.
He said that those who come from any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
He claims that people's faith under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) says that lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are afraid of the terror of the Trinamool Congress and are joining it.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen as a shock to CPI(M) democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its mass base, but it is bound to question the rationale for changing the vote of power.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly accusing the taxi driver of assault, appealing against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Phuket provincial court found Steve Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against the Thai police, alleging that on Sunday morning a local taxi driver along with two other persons attempted to stop him.
But later CCTV footage showed that she had returned safely to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
After questioning Bamfort for two days by Phuket police, he admitted to fabricating the story.
He was kept in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in adult women's prisons.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the entire family is "extremely concerned" about the care of their daughter and they want to call her back to Australia.
It's been a worrying time for us, of course, but we hope she'll be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamphod has appealed against the penal order, and has secured bail on 50,000 Baht.
Meanwhile, the report in Australia said it was holidaying in Krabi's vacation spot in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being contested by a local advocate in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could extend his sentence to two years and force him to remain in an adult prison.
By the way, after the recent killing of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also offer deliverance in an effort to improve its poor tourist image.
