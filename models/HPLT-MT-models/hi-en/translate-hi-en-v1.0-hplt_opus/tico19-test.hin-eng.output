The rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing a similar trend in EU/EU countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in all countries, at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a rapid rise in COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
The group of pneumonia cases with unknown diagnosis-sciences were reported to Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 31 December 2019.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these are cured.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while the rest 6% of cases have an overview of the severe disease requiring critical care.
The death rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4 %.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK to Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, there was further geographical expansion of COVID-19 and at present the activity in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 pandemic went beyond this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported according to the WHO case definition in the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were found in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with only 17,750 cases from Italy and 1,441 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths.
Achieving cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO-received COVID-19 cases from each country in the world are updated at 8:00 a.m. every day.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated the brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases for 14 days taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 - March 15, 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 AM as compared to Italy during the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of a 14-day brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and throughout the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and grew rapidly around February 28, 2020 (supplementary content).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK witnessed a similar increasing trend (supplementary content).
The picture shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases compared to Italy in 2 EU/EEA countries and the UK in the period January 31 - March 15, 2020.
This specifically shows that by 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of comparable cases from Italy's cases only 3 weeks ago or in a short time.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for choosing patients, which must be checked as required for COVID-19 confirmation, including those caught and tested.
In early March 2020, physicians in Italy's affected regions reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
The figures for admission to the COVID-19 cases hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% cases respectively (figures not shown).
They should however be collected in a methodical manner to supplement the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study, conducted in 2010-11, showed a large gap between the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (a 12.5 intensive care and intermediate care bed per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of COVID-19 cases of intensive care bed capacity is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's rapid risk assessment on COVID-19 impersonation of conditions related to health care capacity saturation with estimates for every EU/EEA country and UK.
As cases remain in the EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK so far and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve the defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the continuing community transmission conditions of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care as is happening in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC's rapid risk assessment, with a mitigation approach change from limiting, a faster, proactive, and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented in a timely manner, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide enough time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt their response accordingly.
Acute risk assessments also list public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is very likely that other EU/EEA countries' health care systems will face a rapid surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
More than 3,000 people have died so far from the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and more than 80,000 people have been infected in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a disaster for humans.
Like its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS to occur in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats and produce similar symptoms by the stuff mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects men than older people and women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide timely and comprehensive reviews on the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology of disease, for--science, virology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and prevention.
While there are still a lot of questions to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eradicating the deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020, due to the outbreak of novel viral disease, has become an unexpected and unforgivable memory for all Chinese people who have been requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to the whole country and around 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from the hospital and more than 3,000 deaths due to the virus.
The WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the "enemy of the masses number 1" and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on January 7, 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, for-science, diagnosis, and treatment, which set the sequence of the virus apart from many patients.
This review seeks to summarize the research progress on the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (the outbreak in MERS, 2012).
We will discuss the prevention and forecasting of the disease as well as some other important questions we have learnt so far.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, with about 15% of common colds produced.
However, in this century we have faced twice as many highly pathogenic human CoVs, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible malaise and mortality rates.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in picture 1,1, swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the pandemic quickly spread to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported in health care providers, which indicated that human to human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public traffic shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with Wuhan's seafood market, which was considered to be the start point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to the whole of China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation continues to grow rapidly, the final magnitude and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
The multi-central study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 presented a more up-to-date depiction of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly 30-65 years of age.
About half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, much less than 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years of age.
Males (0.31/100,000) were more infected than females (0.27/100,000) from SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 spread mainly to swarms in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to widespread traffic before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of single-threaded large and covered viruses of RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known as infecting humans.
The casing nozzle (S) joins glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively and then merges the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular fluid; after replication of the viral genome, the casing forms vesicles containing the genome RNA virion with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are later merged into the plasma membrane for the release of the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 indexed samples collected from Wuhan's Hunan seafood market, the original location of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-fine segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2, along with SARS-CoV-2, was found to be receiving for SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2's S protein connects to human ACE2 with a greater weakness than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2, coded by orf3b, can also create novel short proteins and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in viral pathogens and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however there is no known functional domain or motif in orf8.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mixture with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could combine two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and Intermediate Nutrients
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and were transmitted by civet cat and camel respectively in humans.
By racial comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered to be the parent nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to the two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient is unknown to aid in infecting humans by crossing the species barrier of the virus and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as the carrier of the virus in humans from bats that included the same recombinant with S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, indicated that pangolins — often long muzzled, ant-eating mammals used in traditional Chinese medicine — are potential intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of genetic similarity in SARS-CoV-2 found in pangolins.
However, the spread of 1% difference across both genomes is still a big difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not known mainly yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive up to 48 hours in artificial ambient dry environment and less than 20°C and up to 5 days at 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, for 30 minutes at 56 °C and is sensitive to ultraviolet rays; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, parastic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively neutralize the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, after entering the host of the virus, it is first identified by the endogenous immune system of the host, including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
By various routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferon (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophages phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV's N protein can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the customized immune response gets involved in fighting the virus.
T lymph cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T ancillary cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoV can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tribulation resistance, including supplements and antibodies such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient deactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive response of the immune system generates a very large number of free radicals locally that can also cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and multiorgan failure and death in the worst conditions.
The herd is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women with the comorbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by onset.
It is common that people who come in contact with a higher number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed are more likely to get infected than others.
Based on the first 425 cases study in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated average incubation period of 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and its range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases observed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but symptomatic people from transmitting the virus to other people is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually require 14 days of quarantine.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often a major and early symptom of COVID-19 with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced respiratory distress and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly increased the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and cogularopathy.
Patients with acute fever should be tested for the virus for premature diagnosis even without fever and/or respiratory symptoms and pulmonary depiction abnormalities.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for breathing trouble, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of herds generated by transmission from family herds and symptomatic individuals.
Comparatively, the 2012 demographic study observed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing difficulties (55%), as the main symptom.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation and this is in line with the greater lethality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
SARS patients have observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), respiratory distress (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and about 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases worldwide had reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS mortality as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a June 2012 demographic study.
The earlier study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both of the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd usually starts with a single family or a single mass or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the beginning.
However, it has been informed that people can transport the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and cured patients discharged from the hospital can re-convey the virus, which warns of extending quarantine time.
The number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymph cells) in patients at an early stage is normal or low.
For example, lymphatic cell count <1×109/L including white blood cell count <4×109/L with lymphopenia and increased aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients increased and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation in the blood of most patients increased.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of de-dimer, was increased and lymph cell count continued to decrease.
Abnormalities are found in chest radiography in most COVID-19 patients and are represented by bilateral macular images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the surface stress and thus reduces the ability of the lungs to swell and increases the risk of lung stoppage.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain parallel with the most serious condition of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 looked at a patient who died of the disease in the lung of a pneumocyte, the formation of hyaline membranes and the porous leakage of lymph cells, and the multicellular multicentric cells that corresponded to the pathology and AARDS of viral infection and were similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcryptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations in China began to be used for diagnosis on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
The same situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations and radiological findings is necessary and essential for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which, using dipsticks, detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA segments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) without needing any detailed equipment.
If verified in clinical samples, the hope is that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to a lack of experience with Novell CoV, doctors can provide primarily supportive care to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases previously used for treatment or trying out the various therapies proposed (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, plasma from cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from cured patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Drug companies are competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the lungs at the beginning and possibly even other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain the major threat to patients and are the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important to relieve symptoms and save lives and include general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-entrepreneur ventilation, and entrepreneur mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart-pulmonary pathway technique used in the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
Also, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs is also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm occurs as a result of excessive response to the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine Storm is a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the leading cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immune suppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, IL6-resistant monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include changes in T cell-guided immune response; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibitors; blintumomab; repressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
The steroid as immune repressor was widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects while dramatically affecting the disease-diagnosed, especially non-vascular osteoarthritis.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to carefully use the short-term processes of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Until the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analog given in the vein has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed a possible inhibition of other accommodative RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made compounds available to China to perform two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Also, Baricatinib, Interferon-α, Iopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Joint therapy with iopinavir/ritonavir can lead to diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
These treatments should be carefully monitored for interactions with other drugs used in patients.
Plasma and immune production from cured patients
There has been a long history of blood collection from cured patients with an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being infected with the disease.
In fact, the blood of cured patients has a high level of antibodies relative to pathogens.
The antibodies produced by B lymph cells to fight pathogens and other external substances are immunoglobulin (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in the pathogen and deactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method to be used on a large scale.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the plasma-related losses should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and generate cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies so rapidly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that code effective antibodies or to check for effective antibodies to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend primarily on the combination of different components in a different formula based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are yet unknown or redundant because it is difficult to remove and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from severe stages due to a lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Doo capsules and Liao Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%) saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei Province where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients had TCM usage, the recovery rate was the minimum (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published the study only to compare Western Medicine (WM) treatment and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the body temperature in the WM+TCM group was significantly lower than that of the WM group alone, requiring normalization, symptoms to go away and hospitalization.
Most impressively, the WM+TCM group had a markedly lower symptomatic worse rate (lightly severe) than the WM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than only the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Yet, TCM's efficacy and safety still await more well-controlled trials at larger levels and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to mark the system of actions and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 experience a lot of fear of highly contagious and deadly disease and quarantined people also experience monotony, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, short-oxidity, and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause more discomfort and mental suffering.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological diseases, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, psychotropic excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide, were reported.
Finding mandatory contact and quarantine as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more restless and glaring about the effects of irritability, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected persons and those in contact with them, as well as to the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with constant and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission of sensitive nutrients from animal funds and infected humans and are often complementary to antiviral treatment under the control of the pandemic due to the growing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent inactivated immune and/or defensive immunity towards SARS-CoV.
The life-sustaining vaccines have been evaluated in SARS's zoological patterns.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and lethally challenging models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection are still to be determined prior to the commencement of any clinical study.
This is probably because SARS ended up slowly 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
In contrast, Sporadic cases and swarms of MERS arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the regions of the epidemic.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using sub-units of inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant proteins and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic for individuals with non-contradictory capacity.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long-term need (on average 18 months) in the development of the vaccine and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create disease-diagnostic models to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on yet informed clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to the disease-diagnosed COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases COVID-19 occurred primarily at the age of 3065 years, of which 47.7% patients were over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and those who did not have such a need were significantly older than they were (at median age of 51 versus 66), which indicates the outcome of COVID-19 patients being of age as a predictive factor.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been informed that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with ACE2-positive cholangeocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlations and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been proposed as a possible predictive factor for the disease, response to therapy and finally recovery.
The CRP level correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and the diagnosis has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aline aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help to estimate the result.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are the traditional indicator of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: chest radiography and topical progression of clinical symptoms along with other problems should be considered for predicting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are generally immunosuppressive used as conjunctivator therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from nonvascular osteoarthritis with a lifetime disability and poor quality of life.
So, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and short-term COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from exceptional stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and come back to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 differ from SARS.
Along with replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and does not produce mild or any symptoms at the initial stage of infection, like other coVs that produce colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of the virus during daily activities in the early stage or incubation period with a lot of difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmission was thought to have occurred when patients were much more ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the initial stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently underway in China, including the lockdown and continuous quarantine of almost the entire public in Wuhan and surrounding cities.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other regions of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which points to the ups and downs of the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the ups and downs phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established the model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 cured and identified in both the mid-turbinate and throat fah of patients who had gone to the hospital 2 weeks ago indicates that the new virus identified could become a frequent case, like influenza.
However, there have been promising signs from China based on a decreasing number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Initially, Ebola was predicted to have one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 weakens infectivity and eventually ends up being a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible from coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which also creates a new possibility of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers, were probably caused by medical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect people standing next to them in contact with humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, and patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (Series # 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially getting into the air from an infected person or sticking to the surface of things from where they can go to others.
However, only the N95 (Series # 1860s) masks with only 5% of the virus can prevent as little as 10 to 80 nm of the virus from entering the breath; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed one over the other, healthcare providers with direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (Series # 1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
As well as masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person with eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body with his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent facial armor or glasses while working with patients.
In affected or potentially affected areas, the general public is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected individuals.
Three feet is considered to be the proper distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, it would have highly cautioned China based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003 due to its excessive similarity to SARS-CoV.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan's Centers for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low transmissibility and limited fertility in human-to-human and no problem preventing and limiting the disease.
This message freed the public from a lot of fear, especially when the whole country was preparing for the spring festival and the delicate time had come to limit the disease to the lowest level in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies (1) should be quite careful when making public announcements because every word counts for citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) should be more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities; (3) should be more restrictive to limit the potential epidemic to an early stage rather than an attempt to console the public; and (4) frequently release targeted and effective exercises to raise public awareness of the pandemic and periodically check and improve the response system of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to the whole of China and around 50 other countries around the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused SARS to be repeated.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women, and the severity and mortality rates in the elderly are also higher than that of young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when symptomatic, SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, which causes much greater difficulty in limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may be re-positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases are yet to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 has come from bats.
What was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding out the answer to #1 and 2, we can't effectively stop broadcasting and the outbreak can ever recur.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 connects to ACE2, exactly how does the virus enter the air route cells and then cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressed cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get a fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, end up slowly like SARS or continue to occur over and over again like a flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no other option but to prevent the pandemic as soon as possible and bring our lives to normalcy.
The zoological origin of human coronaviruses
The mutations and adaptations have led to the simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two humans who produced mild cold-like diseases were aware of CoVs (HCoVs).
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and deadly nature of the HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought the CoVs back to light and has shocked us with more infectious potential but decreased pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoological disease and it will be useful for us to understand the zoological origin of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
There is also information about the intermediate cell nutrients of some HCoVs.
Identification of animal nutrients in the prevention of human diseases has direct implications.
Examining the interactions of coV-nutrition in animals can also have significant insights on the pathogenicity of coV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the history of the discovery as well as current information about the seven HCoVs with a focus on zoological origin and interethnic transmission.
Importantly, we see a comparison and variation of different HCoVs from the point of view of evolution and gene recombination of viruses.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the implications of the gradual development of the virus on the need to successfully replace nutrients and the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the coronavirus family including groups of ingrown, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which sheltered the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were named "CoVs" due to crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have unbroken genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyproteins.
The 16 non-structural proteins named nsp1~16 of polyproteins are further processed to produce.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins including spike (S), invelop (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many genera-specific auxiliary proteins are also coded by different genera of CoVs.
Depending on the variation in protein sequences, CoV is divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), most of which are HCoVs in the beta-CoV generation and are subdivided into four genealogys (A, B, C and D).
Rhetorical evidence has shown that bats and rodents are mostly gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant cells of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently exceeded species barriers and emerged as some of the important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms like colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2, with a greater likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperpulmonary manifestations, are highly pathogenic while causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients.
The first HCoV-229E breed, B814, was isolated from the nasal drift of cold patients in the mid 1960s.
Since then, further information about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been collected by detailed study, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that the infection of HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, infecting more than 8000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has led to 3,120 deaths and more than 91,000 infections as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world is to be prepared for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have animal origin from bats, rats or domestic animals.
Many evidence supports gradual development from bats of all HCoVs, in which viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show highly genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Detection of the zoological source of HCoVs provides the framework for understanding the natural history of species crossing, the driving force and the bond factors.
It can guide or facilitate the discovery of SARS-CoV-2's cells, intermediates, and enhancing animal nutrients(s) with significant effects in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoological origin, interethnic transmission and pathogens of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the native viruses of HCoVs are non- pathogenic in their natural cell nutrients, but become pathogens after interethnic transmission in new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of HCoV with an increase in infectiousness often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolated HCoV-229E breed from the nasal drift of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of the discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first breed of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cellular lines of the WI-38 lung.
In patients infected with HCoV-229E, symptoms of colds including headache, sneeze, malaise and sore throat were observed in 10~20% of cases with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the gradual pathway and organ enrichment in the brain of a milk-drinking rat.
The clinical characteristics of the HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to the infection generated by HCoV-229E which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathway pathogens such as the influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread all over the world and are likely to be transmitted prominently during the winter with temperate weather.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a nearly 2-week illness.
According to a study by human volunteers, a mild cold developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
Infected with immunity, severe lower respiratory tract infections appear in only a few patients.
SARS, also known as "optical pneumonia," was the first well-documented HIV epidemic in human history, and the third HIV-CoV discovered is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS could be identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
8,096 cases were reported with 774 deaths with the SARS epidemic spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the highest prevalence, it was estimated that with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and maximum viral effects visible on the 10th day of the disease, almost two secondary cases could increase due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle soreness, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, followed by respiratory distress, cough, and respiratory distress as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, neurotic liver function screening and increased creatinine kinase are common abnormalities related to SARS's laboratory.
Airborne anaerobic damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation later.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, usually with cytokine storm, can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be fatal especially for patients with immunocompromised immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy from the patient's relative who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been made in the research of HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to spread to young children, the elderly and patients with respiratory diseases incapacitated in the immune system.
It is common to see colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchitis in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, the Netherlands described the separation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually spread around the world.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases occur due to HCoV-NL63 and its extreme occurrence occurs during early summer, spring and winter seasons.
HCoV-NL63 is related to inhibitory larynx-inflammation, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was separated from the 71-year-old elderly male who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchitis from the community, it was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks of HCoV-HKU1.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these HCoVs from the community have been well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more toxic sub-type of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused serious lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, they also become less toxic or pathogenic when these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves in humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the patient's lungs in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary prevalence in close relatives have been reported in many European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS characterized by progressive severe pneumonia match SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has so far only been observed in MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, swarms of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an international concern public health emergency and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, Hubei China has a case fatality rate of 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 produces severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough, and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can increase as a rapid acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they come in different branches of the ethnic lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCoVs and seeing asymmetry have seen very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the incubation period of the HCoV disease and the duration of the procedure are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are commonly seen during an infection of HCoVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is also seen in forms characterized by both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs acquired from the community.
On the one hand, the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectiousness of HCoVs acquired from the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 decreases as humans progress in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
Whether rectal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV is yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of HCoVs acquired from the community.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectiousness, pathogens and persisting proliferation, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 after human transit.
HCoVs, acquired from all four communities that produce mild symptoms, have become well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be correct that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both can be survivors of ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of optimized mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCoVs in humans in adequate range.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infect, the more likely it is to be fully adapted in humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult for humans to prevent its transmission from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitted to the human population by causing colds in patients with immune disabilities.
These viruses do not require animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted in humans and their transmission cannot be maintained in humans.
They need to stay and spread to their zoological cell and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to that of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least in the present time it is very contagious like HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than the HCoVs acquired from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any shells or intermediate animals nutrients.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will be very useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the gradual development, natural, cell, intermediate and enhancing nutrients of HCoVs.
An animal is a nutrient with a gradual development of HCoV, if it shelters a very close ancestor with a high similarity sharing at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, the shells provide constant and long-term shelter to the nutrients HCoV.
In both cases, the nutrients become naturally infected and are the natural nutrients of the HCoV or its ancestral virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around entry into humans, it is not well adapted to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoological source of human infection and can play the role of a nutrient that increases by temporarily replicating the virus and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of infection.
An HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate nutrient.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also be adapted to intermediate nutrients and maintain long-term locality.
In this case, the intermediate nutritive natural cell becomes nutritive.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS indicator case had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that there was a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV-IgG among animal traders than the general public.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and raccoon dogs in the living animal markets were identified as convectioners of viruses such as SARS-CoV-which are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no SARS was reported to any further after all the sevets of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most of the masked palm civets in the wild or farms that are not in contact with the live animal markets had SARS-CoV negative, which is to say that masked sail civets can only be as severe as the middle growing nutrient and not as the natural cell of SARS-CoV.
Remarkably, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV-resistant antibodies, these possibilities cannot be denied that many species of small mammals can also be intermediate enhancers of SARS-CoV.
All of these seem to be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up search of SARS-CoV's natural animal nutritive revealed very close bat CoV called SARS-related rhinolophosus bat CoV HCU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HCU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive towards the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-resistant antibodies and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with CoVs, SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nutrients of emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS such as CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as living viruses.
Human angiotensin changer enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as a receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from feces samples of bats was demonstrated to use bats, civets and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients who were recovering was able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV among bats sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity in these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the nearest parent virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cell nutrients to SARS-CoV.
Ethnic analysis groupes MERS-CoV into a group similar to bats CoV-HKU4 and bats CoV-HKU5.
Bats use the same nutritive, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for coV-HCU4 and MERS-CoV virus penetration.
MERS-CoV's RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences are ethnically close to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
As of now, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not even be the closest lexicographic nutrients to MERS-CoV.
Studies in the Middle East, on the other hand, have seen that in many African countries humped camels like camels of Middle East origin are seropositive towards MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies.
The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nose of the humped camels, indicating that the authentic shells of the camel MERS-CoV are nutrients.
It is also noteworthy that camels that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally showed mild symptoms but very high virus clearance.
Remarkably, infected camels extract viruses not only from the respiratory tract but also from the feces-faced pathway which is also the main route for the virus to be removed from bats.
However, questions still exist since there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms of many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or any unknown transmission routes that involve species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the CoV RatG13 bat isolated from bats associated with the rhinolophos species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is enough to determine the paternal relationship.
That is, bats can't be the closest cell nutrients to SARS-CoV-2, unless almost identical bats are found in the future.
Probably, the intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Hunan seafood from which the indicators of human transmission phenomenon from potential animals were associated with many early cases of COVID-19.
A number of recent studies have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanika) can also shelter parent beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin cov genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are among the two sub-genres of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the caste lineage, one of which shares a more uniform receptive binding area (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 are very diverse, despite the gene-wide greater sequence similarity.
An earlier study of sick pangolins also reported the presence of a group of viral DNA from lung samples, similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted several different concomitant methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of SARS-CoV-2's direct pangolin origin due to the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2- related beta-CoVs.
The path of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Where the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the most genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the excessive similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is selectively due to the intermediate convergence gradual development.
An alternative proposal favors a recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RatG13 in the third wild organism species.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal-borne origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Ethnic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E bats may have originated from CoVs, while native viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that bats named ARCoV.2 (Applachen Ridge CoV) found in North American three-color bats were seen to have a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-229E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, which was found in Ghana, although Camlids are also its suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, a summary of current information on the animal origin of known HCoVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of the interethnic transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, the epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interethnic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bats close to HCoV-229E have been found to be alpha-CoVs.
There is an Alpaca Alpha-CoV between them.
Many evidence supports transmission from bats of the virus directly to humans.
Previously, humans have had contact with bats in shared ecological habitat, not Alpaca.
Instead, humans have a close relationship with Alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Ultimately, Alpaca Alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that Alpaca HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs are obtained from humans cannot be denied.
In fact, bats are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore no more surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpaca and humped camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interethnic transmission from bats to humped camels and humped camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known on its primary identification and has strengthened even further by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich plume of virus species for interethnic exchange of genetic fractions and interethnic transmission.
Long life, dense settlements, close social interaction and excessive ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats to be the ideal "virus spreader."
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered humped camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted into these camels that have evolved from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural shells nutrients.
MERS-CoV produces a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission is an accident in humans and humans remain the last host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolin in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, like civets in case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of interethnic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be accepted or denied in future studies.
First, bats can be nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2 cells of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins can be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which SARS-CoV-2-related viruses entered new-found.
Humans become infected with the virus by killing and consuming game meats.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Survey of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being discovered.
In addition to a variety of animal nutrients, three key factors regarding the viral are also important in easily crossing the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively higher mutation rate in the RNA replication.
Compared to other single-fibre RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of COV can be considered to be "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per site 2 per year, depending on the stage of COV adaptation in new nutrients.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the deletion of which can also lead to excessive variability and impairment or a decrease in life expectancy.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is thought to suppress the replication of CoV by this exorribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising SARS-CoV-2-resistant agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of their nutrients.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, pointing to higher levels of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already become adapted to another nutrient closer to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which has been well adapted into humped camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic fluctuation will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA genome in CoV puts additional plasticity on genome changes for mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of interethnic co-serial growth, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is backed by abundant unique open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs change the sample over and over again randomly during the RNA replication by unique "copy-choice" procedure.
In the nutrient that acts as a mixing vessel, the fibrous changes often occur during the COV RNA transcription.
Extremely uniform full-length and subgenomic RNA, can recombinate and generate new CoVs.
Ethnic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animals CoVs such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of virus-nutrients with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient recipient is another important factor influencing inter-caste transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of a positive election during interethnic transmission events.
Based on a comparative analysis of the separators between human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV with mutations on the RBD of S proteins in particular is considered to be rapidly adapting to various nutrients.
Typically, RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is chosen by nutrient immune response with intensification.
In SARS-CoV, RBD S1 is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral penetration.
SARS-CoV's RBD is capable of recognizing ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons dogs, leading to an inter-caste transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be isolated from human and civet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in receptive-bonded parentheses for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of the Seavet SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attractiveness of the interaction of spike proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, both of these amino acid replacements can be important in optimizing the viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the bond similarity of its S protein to human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, the cryo-EM study indicates 10 to 20 times more attraction to this addition than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be interesting to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission will require another co-recipient.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but to a different part of S.
Many other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after inter-caste transmission from their animal nutritions.
The interethnic transmission of HCoVs results in the addition of a cellular receptor, also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors.
The natural cell nutrients of humans and HCoVs, such as bats, humped camels, and the variation of these nutrient proteins between rodents can hinder interethnic transmission.
The successful interethnic transmission of HCoVs requires the capture of nutrient dependence factors and the reversal of nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this important area of virus-nutrient interaction.
The non-partisan genome-wide investigation of the nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's latest technology can be fruitful.
The emergence of novel HCoVs: return to the original basis
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bats serve as gene cells of CoVs, HCoVs.
Also, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoV and serve two important stages in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to change viral symphonies too much.
In SARS-CoV ancillary proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to be coding diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in isolated breeds at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion breaks down ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be an adaptation mutation that promotes the change of cells.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genealogy, recognizing a very large number of small recombination regions in RNA-based RNA polymerases.
Reassembly locations were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different genera, which occurred in humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombinate with other animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be borne in mind that artificial elections can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to election pressure-free viruses, such as by the nutrient immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletions.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, Alpaca Alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, leading to a frameshift.
In the end but not less important, the gradual development of novel HCoVs is also caused by the pressure of choice in their cell nutrients.
Symptomsless or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs that indicate mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats have become structurally and physically well adapted to CoVs.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory reaction in bats effectively reduce the pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the natural malignant cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the regulation of the inhibitory natural malignant cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the low expression level of the major tissue conformance complex range I molecules.
In addition, higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by greater metabolic activity of bats can lead to suppression of the replication of CoV and affect proof readings by exoribonuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when entering the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV breeds may also develop by recombination, which may lead to new protein or protein features for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic in shell nutrients such as bats and camels or produce mild symptoms.
They strongly replicate without showing a strong nutrient-resistant reaction.
It hides the secret as to why symptomatic carriers are observed and what causes serious cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms, mainly due to immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, lead to as much severe lung damage as the more immune response.
In contrast, in symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been separated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy of separating the immune response can have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2-therapy.
Interferon reaction is particularly rapid in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should at least be beneficial in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammation activation in bats is defective.
By this logic, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammam with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same common theme from which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While bat beta-CoV has seen 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the markets have been seen sheltering viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the nearest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that pangolins can be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs can contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remained, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally made or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come up for discussion due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly altered our understanding of the animal funds of HCoVs in animal origin and standard transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are native bats and transmission in humans is caused by intermediate nutrients.
Given that the SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civet there should have effectively eliminated the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, Pangolin should be removed from the weight market to prevent animal-borne transmission due to the discovery of several genera of pangolin beta-CoVs close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how future investigations are yet to be clarified.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered humped camels for several decades.
These camels are important means of traffic for the locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to abandon all camels to control MERS as did the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene forms can emerge to generate outbreaks.
Various animal-borne CoVs are circulating in wild organisms.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal-generated potential are very diverse.
It is quite likely that these animal-borne CoVs will have personnel development and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
In order to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in certain regions of China should be abandoned.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response planning should be made.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural cell until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many features that aid in the spread of viruses, the possibility of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about how to stay away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients that will prove useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoological disease is for humans to stay away from the ecological habitats of the natural cells of zoological viruses.
Several parts of the puzzle of the zoological origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat within.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be made clear how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infections should be carried out.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continuous testing in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published the prompt consultation guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides the appropriate context for our experience and to fight this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest clinical criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has now been officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named hyper acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has identified COVID-19 as an epidemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and has been published online in military medical research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information based on ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience are gradually increasing; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China has released a total of seven editions with fundamental changes in certain contexts in the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/).
Now a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, he has introduced a simple marking proposal based on his clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also made valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest diagnosis and treatment guidelines (seventh test version) for COVID-19 and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), any one item of pandemic history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis to confirm the suspected case, or three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed if without a clear pandemic history:
Epidemic history: (1) the history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) the history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or with other communities where symptoms were reported in the past 14 days before symptoms began; (4) the history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells represented normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes at an early stage.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any single item of pathogenic or serological proof that comes with a real-time PCR test positive for (1) SARS-CoV-2; (2) the viral entire genome sequencing showing higher homogeneity than known novel coronaviruses; (3) a positive for IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or a change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies from negative to positive, or a ≥ 4 times increase in the health benefits phase compared to the modulus acute stage.
We can see that real-time PCR tests for nucleic acids in respiratory systems or blood samples were added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then to the seventh edition the serological evidence was added.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of researchers who discovered samples of the respiratory system, including an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and supported bringing the specific immune positive result to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there are many proofs that remind us to be careful with non-typical symptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flow chart should be updated, as they have classified a person with no clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest locating and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update their guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new deaths due to COVID-19 in Bangladesh, highest ever one-day figure
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest single-day death toll from the virus.
Till yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
At an online news briefing, Dr Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, director of IEDCR, said that four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr Mirjadi, two patients were over 60, two between 51 and 60 and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news center, that the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission and was being cared for at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Road Transport and Bridges Minister Ubaidul Qadar said that road transport will be kept off for longer than planned by the coming Saturday.
The public transport shutdown began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essentials such as medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two people and one of them who returned from Italy on March 8.
On March 19, all three were cured.
Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 infection cases cross one million
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million.
COVID-19 is being linked to at least 52 thousand deaths.
The same day the figure crossed, the first coronavirus infection was reported in Malawi and the first death in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was among the few countries that are still free from coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 2 lakh 44 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the US, and this has resulted in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted data from Johns Hopkins University as saying that more than 1,000 deaths have been reported in the US on Wednesday due to the coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that by April 30, Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work.
The Parliament of Portugal voted in favour of extending the national emergency by 15 days; the said resolution was passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a 24-hour curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; earlier the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dawin announced that the state's stay order has been extended to May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, the Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all their stores at the national level to two and one package respectively.
ALDI had also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on checkout sites and on the Facebook pages of the series.
Buyers are reported to be shopping together for a situation where they need to keep themselves isolated due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, said that despite the four-pack ban being implemented, "still stock in many stores is depleting within an hour of delivery" and that the demand was unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there was a "strong surge" in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the volume to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortfall, Coles placed orders for larger packages and also increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI raised stocks to make available early to the pre-planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to increase the stock, but it becomes difficult to do so due to the restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery.
When suppliers are trying to meet the demand and the number of specials has already gone down, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the premature release of the stock, some stores may not operate Wednesday specials.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told a report by News.com.au that stores fill in stocks every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large numbers, and then, after all the stock is sold, the large shelf is left empty behind, making the feeling of shortages even harder.
Coles and Woolworths are of the view that if there were enough goods on the shelf, and products such as toilet paper and sanitizers could go [bought] and exist in large quantities, the disturbance could possibly have been reduced," said Russell Zimmerman, according to ABC News.
Hu Gives a Crapp, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that his stock has been exhausted.
News.com.au reported that Kimberly-Clark, a cleanex toilet tissue-making company, and Sorbent-making company Solaris Paper, insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain supplies.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that in Melbourne, where there are already fewer auctions being done due to buyers holidaying on the long weekend of Labor Day, some property sellers are offering free toilet paper to the first bidders at the auction.
A daily printed in Darwin, the Thursday edition of NT News had an eight-page insert that was cut to be used as a toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on March 3, initially the stores were not willing to impose restrictions; in this report they had said they had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry things, handwashes, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, a two-pack of 12-roll limit was imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper in the online British supermarket Okado on Sunday evening.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a global pandemic.
Although the term "global pandemic" only means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, the WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic.
If countries detect the disease in response to it, treat patients, keep them separate, clue them and unite them," said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of dispersal and severity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented."
In the comments published by CNN in February, he said, "No respiratory virus other than influenza has been detected in a sustained global spread."
Gerbiasis also expressed a similar view when he said, "We haven't seen any coronavirus pandemic so far."
And we have not seen any global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
This new designation of the global pandemic comes after the WHO's decision to declare the outbreak in January an internationally worrying public health emergency.
Dr Anthony Fochie, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "One thing about a hundred things, it's going to get worse."
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and as a result more than 4,600 deaths had occurred.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case mortality rate in China has been estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people and monitoring and self-isolation for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
This pandemic has generated serious global socio-economic dislocation, led to postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and panic buying by people has led to a massive reduction in supplies.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting about 99.4% of the world's students.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and others with appearance, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to low travel and heavy industry closures.
Health authorities in China's Wuhan (capital of Hubei province) reported collective cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is considered to be a zoological origin.
The outbreak-spreading virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus with a close association with bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later diagnosed to be sick on 1 December 2019, and the person after that did not have visible relationships with the group of meat markets.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei province on 17 November 2019, which could be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO informed that there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea with a decrease in new cases in China, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very few cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 of them aged and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide. United Kingdom Chief Scientific Advisor, Patrick Wallace, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before the effective group gains immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and according to the official protocol whose test has been confirmed positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland had official policies not to test only those with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were infection sources for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
Among those who do not recover, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused about 97,000 deaths.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic in general, refers to dead people found positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people who die without testing such as in the home, in the nursing home, etc.
Italy's partial data found that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that [the alleged death toll] is underestimated", a statement supported by descriptive information on the low count in the U.S. Such underestimations often occur in the pandemic, as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths.
As of March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by area and time, and the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health are affected. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the death-case ratio is estimated to drop from 17.3% (for those with symptoms starting from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of people who die from a disease (diagnosed and non-diagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Center for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for a pandemic overall is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR projections.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
Macy's Bonnie, from Penn State University, said: "When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks tend to stabilize in general and begin to decrease when there are no available nutrients for the disease.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible guess right now about when that will happen."
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could end by June" if all countries follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kuchersky of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 is "potentially going to be circulating for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more).
I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eliminated, as it transmits very easily," said William Schafner of Vanderbilt University, and it could turn into a "seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The intensity of coming back will depend on the range of group immunity and mutations.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (suffocation), reduced sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhoids, diarrhea, or eucalyptus. About one in six people, according to the WHO, become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septical trauma, and death.
Some of the infected people may be symptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and checked so that the infection is removed.
The Chinese estimate of the figurative ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The normal prophylactic period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it most commonly lasts five days. An example of uncertainty, an estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and subsequently reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be transmitted mainly by small droplets generated during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without a mouth cover can lead to drops ranging from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some people have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets generated while speaking that remain in the air for a longer period of time. Inhaled droplets may also occur while exhaling, including when talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly through breathing in the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as duct insertion and heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to the depilation of respiratory secretions and thus airborne proliferation.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it may spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of feces-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication may be possible before the symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
Testing for people's disease for three days before the onset of symptoms has come positive, which suggests that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of symptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but symptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection investigations.
According to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person normally infects two to three other individuals. This virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, up to one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, it varies depending on the humidity and temperature. Tests for COVID-19 for pets and other animals have come positive.
There is no evidence that the virus can go from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing their hands after exposure to animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an innovative virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from household soap, which decomposes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that it is a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that coronaviruses are genetically grouped with two bat-derived breeds of beta-coronavirus, subgenus serbecovirus (dynasty B).
This is similar to 96% of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
In comparison to the entire genome so far, the general genetic content between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to quantify pangolins as intermediate nutrients.
The infection can be temporarily detected by the virus on the basis of symptoms, although the confirmation finally comes from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although many of its image features make it less specific with other pneumonias and disease processes being similar.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to check for COVID-19 or to diagnose."
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which has been released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is performed on nasopharyngeal fas, but one throat fas can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing antibody detection serological tests.
As of 6th April 2020, none of these has been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be widely approved for use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characterized image characteristics on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absent pleural secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Having similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, without being confirmed by PCR, there is limited uniqueness of the image in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results of the chest to PCR and demonstrated that although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening instrument in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the image characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CTs.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include, maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a tissue and putting that tissue directly into the trash can.
People who may already have an infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to make physical distancing to prevent transmission are also recommended. Many governments have banned or advised not to allow all non-essential arrivals and departures to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a state of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community don't know where and how they got infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users receive a message if they are in close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. False perceptions are spreading about ways to prevent infection; for example, rubbing the nose and gargle with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after sprinkling, coughing or sneezing the nose.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with multiple solutions, including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of contact with a disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chromhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a facility such as an office or day care is suspected or confirmed by a COVID case, all areas such as offices, toilets, public spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick individuals, etc., should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue while coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who can get infected, as wearing masks can limit the amount of breath-dropping drops and the distance to be covered when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene." Masks have also been recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO recommends wearing masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are taking care of a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make face masks of clothes at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned outings in public places without wearing masks or covering nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear face masks when they go to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all individuals entering the grocery store to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when they go to the public sector.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks in trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks while going out, while it has also been recommended to make homemade face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Facial masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control functions, which aim to slow the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum mass reduction recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was made from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Individuals with underlying medical conditions such as elderly adults and diabetics, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune systems are at a higher risk of serious disease and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "making social distancing" with "making physical distancing" to make it clear that the purpose is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact either virtual or remote.
The use of the term "social distancing" created implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, full social segregation should be adopted. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations for having sex only with the person you live with, which does not have symptoms of the virus or virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently visited a country or region with extensive transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last potential risk.
The strategies of control of an outbreak are inhibition or suppression, and mitigation.
Prevention is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at detecting infected people as well as implementing other measures and vaccinations to control the infection so as to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts go into a extinguishing state: measures are taken to slow down the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
Both prevention and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so as to reverse the epidemic by reducing the original reproductive number from 1. Part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is trying to reduce the epidemic extreme, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of crumbling healthcare services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face masking and self-quarantine; community measures intended to make physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling collective gathering programs; community participation to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning of surfaces intended for the purpose of prevention of outbreaks. More stringent actions were taken in China when the severity of outbreaks became apparent, such as quarantine the entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began a large-scale investigation and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed a huge penalty on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the U.S. show that there are major challenges in mitigation (slowing the spread of the pandemic but not stopping) and repression (turning the growth of the pandemic).
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by 2/3 and death by half, but even after these hundreds of people die and health systems crumble.
Suppression can be given priority, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first), otherwise the transmission from dysfunction in measures returns faster.
Long-term intervention for the suppression of the pandemic generates social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking cold medicines without prescription, drinking fluids and relaxing can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Many compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO some "traditional and home remedies" may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care has been described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and the WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling and segregating COVID-19 infected patients whenever possible, and increasing intensive care capabilities by personnel training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one is of the opinion that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on 26 December and which was treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Wuhan Jiangan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus."
Police warned eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, on charges of spreading false rumours and another doctor, I Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the WHO.
Significant cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, which resulted in the start of the investigation in early January. During the initial stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early January 2020 and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to movement due to the Chinese New Year and Wuhan Transport Center and being the major rail exchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Shenzhen region have restricted independent movement and established border controls.
National responses include quarantine measures such as quarantine (homestay orders, shelter orders in its place, or lockdown) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people or nearly 90% of the population in the US are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - nearly a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report shows that the first case took place on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of pneumonia with unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed Wuhan Jiangan CDC on December 27.
Early genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Following the arrival of these information, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumours" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a furious campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which was called a "war of the people" by Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping.
Described as the "biggest quarantine in human history", a siege zone was announced on 23 January to prevent movement in Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was banned.
The Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshenson Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later another hospital, Leishenson Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as conference centers and stadiums into temporary hospitals. On January 26, the government set up additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including the issuance of health announcements for passengers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau established a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Measures were set up to work remotely in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
The public movement was controlled in many cities, and it is estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external ban. After the outbreak hit its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took strict steps to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
Beijing, for example, has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. On March 23, only one case was reported domestically in mainland China over the past five days, in this example through a passenger returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically stopped and the outbreak in China has been controlled.
The same day, two months after the lockdown was imposed, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or housing permit holders will be suspended from 28 March, as well as there is no specific details on when the policy will end.
Those who want to enter China will have to apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses. The state council declared a day of mourning by starting at 10:00 pm on April 4, with a three-minute national silence, which was at the time of the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online while following physical distancing to avoid the new COVID-19 outbreak.
The outbreak of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely related to the gathering of crowds in Daigu of a new religious movement known as the Shinchiji Church of Jesus.
The Shinchiji devotees coming from Wuhan to Daigu were suspected of the origin of the outbreak.
As of February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the church's 9,336 followers reported symptoms. South Korea declared the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were recorded in Korea, which rose to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined when tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programs were also affected and were therefore changed. The program that South Korea introduced was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to check the population for the virus and isolate any infected people as well as to locate and quarantine those who contacted them.
Screening methods included mandatory self-notification of symptoms by new international arrivals via mobile applications, quick testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not having quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon, claiming the government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised its response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was informed that all new foreign arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks from April 1.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kom on February 19, where two people died later that day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Iran allocated five trillion riyals to deal with the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
The plan to limit travel between cities was announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities prior to the Persian New Year Navroz.
As of 16 March 2020, Shia shrines in Kom were open to pilgrims. Iran became the hub of virus transmission after China during February.
Amid claims of hiding the amount of outbreaks in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases to be related to Iran by February 28, indicating that the amount of outbreaks could be more severe than 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government by that day.
The Iranian parliament was closed when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally free detained human rights defenders for peaceful protests and temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It said there is a greater risk of virus spreading in closed institutions such as quarantine centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
As of March 23, 50 new cases were reported every hour in Iran and a new death was occurring every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there could be five times more cases than what is being reported in Iran.
It has also been suggested that the US sanctions imposed on Iran may have affected the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded that economic sanctions be eased for the most affected nations, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to postpone all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Starting from 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21, an unrelated group of COVID-19 cases were detected. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new judicial-law to prevent outbreaks, with more than 50,000 people quarantined from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In areas with outbreaks, entry and exit will not be provided.
Work activities and sporting events in those areas have already been ordered to be postponed. "On March 4, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 deaths occurred in Italy.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held without eyewitnesses until April, but on March 9, all sports were completely postponed for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered to stop almost all business activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations about the protocol for sorting serious patients, which can be employed.

As of April 5, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy reported 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 of deaths, and 21,815 of recovered cases.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus by that time may have contributed to higher mortality rates.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most relaxed of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not implemented any social distancing or large-scale quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in response to concerns faced by the public. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised people to stop all non-essential travel and social interaction, suggesting that people work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments such as pubs and gyms should be closed as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' salaries to the extent of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced measures to create strict social distancing, banning the gathering of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activity to what is considered essential.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforced by the police through fines imposed and crowding.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for businesses deemed to be "necessary", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations and garages.

On 28 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the U.S. government's premier public health institute - announced that they have developed their test kits.
Despite doing so, the U.S. made a slow start to the trial, making it difficult to understand the actual extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test was interrupted by faulty test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive norms (hereafter a doctor's order was required) for people to qualify for a test by the beginning of March.
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests were conducted in the US.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests were conducted.

On the other hand, Chinese assistance has been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency assistance campaigns for developing countries.
WHO has appreciated the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and conserving the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered efforts to prevent and contain, and the current crisis where the central government has provided "regular updates to avoid fear before the Lunar New Year holidays."
On January 23, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gouden Galiia commented that while "of course WHO did not recommend" it was "a very important sign of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history." On January 30, after the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of other cases, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the first measures were taken during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the reason for the PHEIC was "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that there is "no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems set up to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was about to emerge".
Tedros further announced in statements, that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On February 11, WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease in a press conference.
On the same day, Tedros said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire UN system in response."
As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which coordinated the entire UN response, which according to the WHO will enable them to "focus on health response, while other agencies can use their expertise in enduring the broader social, economic, and developmental implications of the outbreak."
On February 14, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was activated to assist in domestic management and to evaluate the severity and contagiousness of the disease by hosting meetings with workshops and major national-level institutions and to visit the region to assess the impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural arrangements. On February 25, WHO announced that the world should make more efforts to be prepared for the possible coronavirus pandemic, adding that although it would be too early to call it a pandemic right now, countries should be "at a stage of being prepared."
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO authorities said that the threat of coronavirus globally will be assessed from "high" to "very high", which is the highest level of vigilance and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergency program, warned in a statement that "it's a reality check for every government on earth: it's time to wake up."
This virus may be coming your way and you need to be prepared," insisting that the right response measures can help the world to survive "its worst."
Ryan further said that current statistics have not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human being on earth will be exposed to that virus."
On March 11, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak an epidemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming level of prevalence and severity and the alarming level of inaction". WHO has faced major criticism as to inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delay in making a public health emergency declaration and classifying the virus as an epidemic.
The rebound included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people until April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts insisted on respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts emphasized that everyone has a right to health, including people with disabilities, minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, homeless, people living in extreme poverty conditions, people living in detention, as well as other undocumented groups requiring refugee and government assistance.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform to provide appropriate timely and comprehensive information as well as perspectives and advice on policy responses in countries around the world.

The Chinese government has been criticized by the U.S., UK Minister for Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for dealing with the pandemic that began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed for dealing with quarantine efforts in central China, indicating dissatisfaction with the political institution's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected a pre-acceptance of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, which was in favor of conspiracies about COVID-19 originating from the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's US administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus," saying that China's "control system has now turned a virus into a global pandemic", which some critics have considered as racism and "deviating from their administration's failure to prevent disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government wire, which underscores communication mortgagor with clear origins in the National Security Council, citing the strategy as "everything is about China."
We are being asked to try to send this message in any way, including press conferences and television appearances." Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's attempt to send aid to countries with the virus is a part of the propaganda to enhance the global impact.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that it has "geopolitical components that include the struggle for influence and the politics of 'liberalism' through reshuffles."
China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner.
China has also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, allegedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
The donation of Jack Ma's 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of converting intended aid to other nations for their country.
And there have been mask-related disputes between Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and other countries such as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-hit Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said that "only China responded bilaterally."
This, of course, is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited a nameless "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or too little of Italy".
This source accused Russia of "geopolitical and diplomatic" flattering.
Lombardy President Etlio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia sent medical aid material from a cargo plane to the US.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "[Putin] believes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials will increase production, they will also be able to pay returns when necessary."
The largest NATO war exercise after the end of the Cold War in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise will be held at a low level.
Secretary-General of Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public-health crisis, it is not only jeopardizing the lives of soldiers from the US and many European countries but also the residents of the countries where they are working." The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with nearly two dozen parliament members infected as well as fifteen other current or former political people.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help on 14 March 2020 stating that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to not having access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. This outbreak has prompted calls for the U.S. to adopt social policies equally in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of financing for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election prospects in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.
Japan's "unexplained and inactive quarantine efforts" were criticized by South Korea when Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be quarantined at the designated sites by the government for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for the impeachment of Moon, claiming the government mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised its response. The pandemic has prompted countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could help governments strengthen their hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament allowed Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, to rule indefinitely by voting, suspending parliament as well as elections and punishing those who were found to be dealing with the virus and the crisis and spreading false information about the government.
Coronavirus outbreaks have been blamed for multiple instances of supply shortages, arising from the use of tools to fight outbreaks globally, fear-induced shopping, and disruptions to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about a shortage of drugs and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Fear-induced shopping conditions were also seen in many areas, which led to a shortage of groceries such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from the shelves, leading to a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned of delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to a twenty-fold increase in the normal price as well as a delay in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, warning the WHO that it will endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daigu shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity created a shortage of infant formulas in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan region and high demand for food products, both regions have been avoiding extreme food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, preventing food shortages that were anticipated in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major reduction in its significant agricultural production, but according to industry representatives prices may rise.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily seen in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials issued stockpiles of sugar-meat to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, government measures to prevent the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5% in the first two months of 2020 on the economy in China.
Since mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the outbreak of the virus has been considered a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Demaris, the Agathe of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clear image emerges on possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic outcome of the pandemic on global growth could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis showed a $300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly became a "faggot" after oil prices fell sharply due to lower demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
Due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak on February 27, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported the sharpest drop since 2008, with the Dow dropping 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices fell by more than 10% that week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's totalitarian eligibility criteria, but maintained a negative expectation.
Stocks fell again on the basis of coronavirus fears, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many people consider the possibility of an economic slowdown.
Economist Mohammed Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting much faster than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to traffic restrictions, closure of public places including travel attractions, advice of governments to stop any travel across the globe.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the British regional airline Flybay collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was the highest ever seen.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of this pandemic coincides with the timing of the Chinese New Year holiday, the major travel session associated with the election.
A large number of events, including annual New Year celebrations, were canceled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including forbidden city and traditional temple fairs in Beijing.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, with most workplaces directed not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, with schools closed by March and canceled their New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours decreased or temporarily closed.
Retailers' visits to Europe and Latin America have declined by 40%.
Retailers from North America and the Middle East saw a drop of 50-60%.
In March as compared to February, people walking to shopping centres fell by 33-43%.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as an increase in hygiene, setting up thermal scanners to check shopkeepers' temperature, and cancelling gatherings. According to a UN Economic Commission for Latin America estimates, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who wouldn't be in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck in homes in inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and drop the unemployment rate to 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates. Several million migrant workers in India have become unemployed due to the lockdown (which is paid through daily wages). Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some kind of unemployment. 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since they went into lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal debt plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to government-funded short-term working plans called Kurazarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected both individuals working and working independently, while affecting the operations of organizations globally.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector attempted to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance locations, and other cultural institutions worldwide, and in varying degrees, were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, celebrations, and demonstrations cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. Another recent and rapidly growing result of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting ceremonies, and other social gatherings, such as concerts and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week observation in Rome, which takes place during the last week of Lent's Christian mourning session, has been canceled.
Many bishops-areas have recommended elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending mass on Sunday; some churches have provided church services through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic bishops-area of Rome closing their churches and prayers and emptying Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak were cancelled and later shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption to the game calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season have been canceled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plan, which was originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be rescheduled "on a date ahead of 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or canceled.
This has led to many gamblers adopting online methods, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many big theaters such as Broadway ones also suspended all demonstrations.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based "functions" to promote artists' performance, distribution, and their work.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distractions amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and growing prejudice against people with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries, xenophobia and racism have been noted.
Many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have witnessed incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Since February, information (when most of the cases were still confined to China) has documented racist sentiments of Chinese people in different groups around the world being eligible to receive viruses or to receive justifiable penalties.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origins.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people in areas prone to the virus.
Following the progression of outbreaks in new hotspot countries, the first countries in Europe to experience severe outbreaks of COVID-19 may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to prevent the disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became popular on Twitter in Japan.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the US have reported rising levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus," which was considered racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign vacuumed people from Wuhan to Novi Sanjhari.
Students from Northeast India, whose border is with China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "hence God has taken revenge from them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling it a "mistake". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents received a boost from the pandemic, in which foreigners were described as targeted to "foreign waste" and "disposal."
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for some part or the whole of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to outbreaks with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods to detect the presence of the virus and to detect antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immune detection (hemorrhoids-science) can be used for both diagnosis and people monitoring.
Immune tests show how many people have been diagnosed with the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to inform or who were symptomless.
The results of this investigation can determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass resistance in people.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among people as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had checked more than 3% of its population and there are considerable inequalities over how many tests have been conducted in different countries.
This inequality is also likely to significantly affect the mortality rate of reported cases, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasopharyngeal swabs or mucus samples can be checked.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with sore throats are reliable in the first week of the disease itself.
Later the virus may disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For those who have been tested in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the inside by the suction catheter by air or the coughing material (mucus) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Berlin in January 2020 in Charité, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company CoganBiotech developed a diagnostic category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits from the National Medical Products Administration of China. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panels to public health laboratories by international reagent resource.
In one of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test kit, faulty reagents resulted in unremarkable results, and caused problems with testing on CDC in Atlanta; this led to an average of less than 100 samples a day of successfully processed samples throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The investigation was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. U.S. business laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, Labcorp announced availability across the country for testing COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics provided COVID-19 testing across the country by 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; the collection and processing of samples should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
The investigation was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 February 2020. On 12 March 2020 it was reported to have developed a probe to detect the infection of myo clinics. On 13 March 2020, Rosh Diagnostics received permission from the FDA for a high amount of testing that can be done within 3.5 hours, resulting in about 4,128 tests can be done in a 24-hour period from one machine.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authority (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to check on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holologic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, the same way Sheffield received the EUA from the FDA for a check that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a probe that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests every day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal antibodies that specifically connect to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, with the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, just like an acute influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "the chest radiograph has less clinical significance in the early stages, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms."
The distinctive features of CT include bilateral multilober ground-glass opsification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effects of subplural, crazy pawing and consolidation develop.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source point of the current pandemic, has suggested that it is significantly more sensitive than PCR despite being less specific, with many of CT's illustration characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that the CT should not be used as a screening or first-line screening for COVID-19 diagnosis. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine immunity in individuals starting 7 days after the onset of symptoms or around them and to detect infections to monitor people. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or through Point-of-Care Testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many diagnostic labs will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples can be used to see the resistive reaction.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
There is no need for the first withdrawal step before the trial, unlike PCR methods. On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when required and are thus now able to deliver their immune tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received approval from Europe for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
Within a few hours there is the ability to test hundreds of samples and therefore it is much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
The antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection. In early April, the UK found that any of the immune test kits they purchased were not good enough for use.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide a sample tube to the patient," they will return spitting in it and get the result of the investigation shortly after. The British NHS announced that they are launching a plan to check suspicious cases at home, which removes the risk of infecting others of the patient if he goes to the hospital or removes the risk of disinfecting the ambulance used. The professional health worker in the drive-through investigation of suspected cases of COVID-19 takes the sample taking proper precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the ability to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulance setting and conducted 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the check is ordered by the doctor, the cost is borne by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Drive-through tests were offered in several big cities until March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that by week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested and 33,491 (6.9%) samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, involving week 12/2020. In Israel, researchers at Technian & Rembum Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients together by combining samples and if the combined sample is found to be positive. In Wuhan, a 2000 square meter temporary emergency search laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese language: 火眼, or "Fire Eye") was launched on February 5, 2020, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
With the construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model has seen that if this ability to check was not started, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Huo-Yen laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple open source frameworks have been released by Origami Esse that can use 93 tests to test as many as 1122 samples of COVID19 patients. These balanced frameworks can be run in small labs without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Prior to March, reagent deficiencies and insufficient quantities caused problems in large-scale checks in the EU, the UK, and the US.
This prompted some authors to explore protocols for sample preparation that include heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for coronavirus per capita, and was on the way to raising the level of testing to reach a larger level of population.
This was due to the ability to conduct drive-through checks and the combination of purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to do thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to work on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany's method of manufacturing kits to develop low-income countries without resources.
Germany's law was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak there were problems on the reliability of the test kit between China and the United States and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations of the test by health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government over the years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused thousands of outstanding tests in private U.S. laboratories to pile up and the supply of Fahs and chemical reagents became stressful.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its test kits.
In the United States, there was a "decrease" in the test kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Biogei Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found the results were not accurate.
The firm reported that the wrong results could be due to the failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the faulty test kits and replace them with the second test kit provided by Shenzhen Biogei. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic gave the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these should be put into the Danube. Ateş Kara of Turkey's Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased from China by Turkey had a "high error rate" and they "did not use them". The UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
After the investigation, people who tested positive received positive results from quarantine and detection of people who came in contact with SARS-CoV-2.
Instead of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the Vò town of Italy checked twice on the entire population of about 3,400 people at an interval of about ten days.
About half of people with positive results had no symptoms, and people with all discovered cases were quarantined.
New infections were completely eliminated by the travel ban at the commuting place.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown significantly slower than other developed countries in Singapore without aggressively detecting contact, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantine, but closing extreme restrictions such as forced restaurants and retail establishments.
Many programs have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on time on March 23 after school holidays.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by aggressively detecting contacts, by internal travel restrictions, by checking and quarantine, but by less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that in countries where there have been more tests than numbers of deaths, the mortality rate is much lower, possibly because these countries are more able to detect only mild or unsymptomized people.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to investigate and have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference labs for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference labs, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of positives in tests" is influenced by the country's testing policy.
In a country where only hospitalized people are screened, the percentage of positive tests will be higher than in a country where all citizens are screened, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at any "essential moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the stool-faced route.
People can also get infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common colds, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where it is important to wash hands with soap are: before and after defecation, after cleaning or changing the nape of the baby, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing food or before and after consumption of raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning the baby using a toilet.
After sprinkling, coughing or sneezing your nose.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to clean the pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause the disease) and chemicals by hand that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for ordinary people.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reducing newborn mortality in cases of childbirth at home.
A 2013 study showed that well-hand washing exercises in children under the age of five may slightly improve their length.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Hand washing-promoting measures can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea cases can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and intensive respiratory infections (ARI) as an auto-induced behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
A leading ARI, pneumonia is the most leading cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 18 million children killed each year.
About 35 lakh children die annually due to diarrhea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap a strong habit before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or therapeutic measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and the number of deaths from intensive respiratory infections by up to one-fourth.
Hand washing is usually integrated with water, cleaning system and other cleaning system measures as part of the Sanitation (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can damage the skin due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Hand washing too often is also seen as a symptom of psychosis-obligation disorder (OCD).
During the day there are five important times when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission from the faeces-faced path of the disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, bowel movement), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing nappies), before feeding the baby, before feeding and preparing food or raw meat, fish, or poultry before/after consumption.
Other occasions when the proper technique of hand washing should be practiced to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after the treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or sprinkling your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of families adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; in the US with 77 percent it was moderate; and in China with 23 percent it was the lowest rate. There are now several behavioral changes methods available to increase hand washing behavior with soap at critical times. Mass hand washing by school children at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to inculcate a habit of hand washing in children's behavior.
The "essential health care program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children's health and education.
The basic function of this national program is to clean teeth daily with fluoride as well as to wash hands with soap daily, take anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It is better to remove microorganisms from the skin by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce the barriers in the solution, and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, adequate flow of water in the cleaning helps.
Due to repeated use, solid soaps may contain bacteria remaining from previous uses.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to the bacteria being washed with foam.
Nevertheless, according to the CDC, "soaps containing liquid soap dropping facility on palms without touching hands are better".
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted with emphasis on health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, with an extensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even though antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic-resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to the humid and skin-protecting agent, refined formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin adapters (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soaps, containing triclosan, are as effective as consumer-class antibacterial soaps in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands.
Comfortable hot water for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria increase very rapidly at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a hand hygiene agent with a water-free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, worn-out alcohol waterless hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these isopropyls are based on alcohol or ethanol, which are grouped with glycerin in a gel such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid), or a humidor such as a liquid or foam, for ease of use and to reduce the effects of drying alcohol.
Mixing dilute hydrogen-peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitisers destroy bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers that contain 70% alcohol, destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (similar to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and destroy 99.99% to 99.999% bacteria 1 minute after application (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) types of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal inflammation. Adequate hand disinfectants or alcohol rubs should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and rear part of both hands and the knuckles of the middle and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until liquid, foam or gel dries out.
Finger knuckles should also be thoroughly washed by rubbing them in both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick pesticide activation towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as replacements for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of drying alcohol by mixing glycerin and/or other lubricants in the formula can be reduced or eliminated.
In clinical trials, skin irritation and dryness decreased significantly compared to soaps or antimicrobial amulets from lubricant-based alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
Contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to rarely causing allergies to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs.
The low tendency to induce annoying contact dermatitis compared to hand washing with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, non-watering agents do not clean organic substances with hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activation.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Similar to soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent as it forms an alkaline solution when exposed to water.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap, if soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with hot or cold running water.
Flowing water is recommended because basins with stable water can be contaminated, although water temperature does not matter.
Moisten the proper amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed by rubbing for a longer time.
Wash thoroughly under running water.
Washing in the basin can contaminate hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are more easily recontaminated. The most missed areas are the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipping nail polishes can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to protect hands from getting dry; dry skin can cause damage to the skin which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging jar or gourd with suitable pores and/or using ash. In conditions of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-conservation solutions are available, such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
Tip-tap is a simple technique in which a leg-operated lever, used to place a small amount of water on a rope-hung jug, and a hand and soap pillow.
Drying hands effectively is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A large amount of research suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
The total number of bacteria after hand washing and drying from hot air dryers increased by an average of 194% on finger pads and 254% on palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by an average of 42% on finger pads and 15% on palms.
After hand washing and drying from paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% on average finger pads and 77% on palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability of other toilet users and the toilet to cross-contamination of the environment.
The jet-air dryer, which ejects air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow micro-organisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
Using hot-air hand dryers spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towel showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, various hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying the hands:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand dryers have been compared with drying from paper towels.
Hand washing is an option using hand sanitizer wipes in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelvis discovered its effectiveness in the prevention of the disease in the hospital environment (in 1846) medical hand washing became mandatory.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about their hand washing when they forget.
In one study, their use has led to a decrease in the infection rate.
The hands are medically washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, in which foam is made using soap and water or the appropriate amount of gel and each part of the hands is rubbed.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed with each other.
If there are garbage under the nails, a stiff-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water on the hands, it is important to wash thoroughly and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit door should be opened if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("disinfectants") and prevent them from being transmitted.
According to The New England Journal of Medicine report, handwashing in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, with a large number of physicians and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rub in health care areas.
Document guidance of hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
A relevant review was carried out by Vitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if performance of regulatory compliance is necessary.
The World Health Organization has set "five chances" for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluid
before the germ-destructor work, and
After care of the patient. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "microbial" soap) provides the firepower to the hand washing agent.
Before performing surgery or in an arrangement in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly widespread, such a firepower may be desired. To 'rub' your hands for the surgery rip-off, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfect towels for drying hands after washing, and a disinfected brush for rubbing and another disinfected means for cleaning under the nails.
All the ornaments should be removed.
This procedure normally requires washing hands and wrists up to 2-6 minutes.
No need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand wash is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use hand disinfectants before and after care for a sick person.
For control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning increased by more than 35%, very little additional benefit was obtained.
By hand washing with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is more than tripled compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol-based solution to hand washing with antibacterial soap for a mean time of 30 minutes, it turned out that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium deficial spores by hand. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care arrangements may include education to employees on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in various health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economical, necessary means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, in people's homes, in schools and workplaces it is a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behavior by lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities.
For example, there are very few hand washing taps near every private or public toilet in most rural Africa, even though cheap options exist to build a hand washing station.
However, low hand washing rates, rather than being caused by soap or water shortages, can also be caused by put-in habits.
The encouragement and support of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behavior of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social promotional campaigns are less effective. An example for hand washing promotion in schools is the "three-star method" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, cheap steps to ensure that students wash hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars, respectively.
Making hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotional campaigns that are done to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to try to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of hand washing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and hygiene measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially those with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who gave birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the middle of the 19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English who are the "founders of modern nursing."
Most people at the time believed that the infection was caused by a foul smell called myasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect yourself from such infectious diseases in many countries.
For example, posters with "hand washing correct techniques" were hung in close proximity to hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airports toilets in Germany.
The phrase "washing your hands" from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for something or to accept collusion in it.
It derives from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate distinguished himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up a fictitious stain, reflecting her criminal conscience about the crimes she committed and how to induce her husband to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people wash hands more often than others, after remembering or contemplating unethical actions, and attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water to wash hands is a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions, including Bahai religion, Hinduism, Tavila in Judaism and Netilat Yadyam, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vazoo in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing to provide hygiene after certain actions in particular.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using toilets in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Control of the dangers of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace
Control of the dangers of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are the applications of occupational safety and health practices for the control of threats.
Proper control of the risk of disease spread at the workplace, depends on the workplace and the work to be done, based on the risk assessment of contact sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual personnel who are at greater risk of getting COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact work involves minimal occupational contact with people and other co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Medium contact risk actions are those that require frequent or close contact with people who do not know or suspect COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: ventilation from high-efficiency air filters, using sneeze guards, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for that situation if the COVID-19 infected person is faced with.
OSHA considers health workers and dead-house personnel to be at high contact risk, who are exposed to COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk becomes high contact risk by increasing if personnel perform processes that generate aerosols on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have many effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work for fear of getting sick, needing to take care of others or possible contact.
What goods are in demand, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as short demand times or purchases through delivery or on-the-go services), can change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of objects from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparation and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
The plans address levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including risk factors arising from sources of risk, home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of response to an outbreak includes: reducing transmission between employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in a community with a place of business affects the reactions to be adopted.
A sequence of threats controls is a structure that is widely used to form a group of threats controls according to effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, there are the most effective control engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal safety equipment.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without relying on employee behavior, and this can be the most economical solution in implementing.
Administrative controls are changes in the work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
All types of PPEs should be selected, properly fitted (e.g., respirators), worn consistently and properly, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact work involves minimal occupational contact with people and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and well-to-do hand washing, encouraging personnel to stay home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquettes covering cough and sneezing, tissue and waste vessels, preparing far-reaching or recessive shifts if necessary, discouraging personnel from using others' tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting work environments.
Early identification and segregation of potentially infectious individuals at the workplace is an important step for the safety of personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without medications that reduce or change symptoms, and that disease leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk tasks include tasks that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who do not know or suspect COVID-19 to be infected, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the person has recently travelled internationally to a place with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These include personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include setting up high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and setting up drive-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick personnel to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up santern shifts, preventing unnecessary travel to places with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communication plans, including: establishing a platform to respond to personnel concerns, providing the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers who need to use personal hygiene, providing resources and work environments that may be required to promote personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting of face-to-offs, and other contact workers, including reduced exposure to face-to-to-to-covering, reducing face-covering and protective measures.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by 6 feet, nominating a crew member to serve the sick person and asking the sick person to give a face mask or cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing the sick person.
When caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear disposable medical gloves, and if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially wear additional personal protective equipment.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, postpone travel when sick under the controls of hazards and inform the self-isolating and immediately onboard medical center if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board the ship.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be carried out in the room of the isolated person. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building without community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling meals in field visits, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, avoiding arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is enough transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to social distance making strategies. For law enforcement personnel carrying out daily law activities, immediate health risks are considered to be as follows by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected persons with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during holding, personnel should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes, before reusing their duty belts and equipment, and follow standard operating procedures for the preservation and disposal of used PPE and for the preservation and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and dead-house personnel to be in high or ultra-high categories of contact risk.
High contact risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are exposed to known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
These become very high contact risk if personnel perform, collect, or handle samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients on aerosol-generating processes.
Aerosol generating processes include duct insertion, phlegm induction processes, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or collecting specimens from rip-offs.
High-contact dead-house functions involve people who prepare for the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including when carrying out aerosol-generating procedures.
Specific negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and dead-house arrangements.
The samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in different waiting areas. In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-generating procedures.
In the U.S., N95 filtering facepiece respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted through physical fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entry point.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chonga, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for specific work, using the same respirator without removing during the care of many patients with the same diagnosis, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for symptomatic individuals.

Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
There are extraordinary circumstances around us this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that all human beings in the world are connected and that we have responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enhancement, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we've seen among all our colleagues on email, call and chat proves in an extraordinary way how fortunate we have been to work with so many extraordinary humans.
I am so grateful and proud to have all of you as co-workers that I cannot say in words.
Last week a man shared his appreciation of our work with me.
He reminded me of how meaningful it is to be able to turn the world to Wikipedia at the moment, and how powerful it is to remain available to all and online to this very important resource.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or are the source of our co-workers' salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now it needs the most.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, both will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work with us this coming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin pointed out earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our methodology and prepare a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response to the situation we were facing, and the best way to sustain the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve stress and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day until further notice, or 20 hours per week.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not keeping track of your time.
If you are sick, don't work.
We don't have to say it, but we are saying it.
No need for a sick leave or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are seen by someone or the other.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please let the Brian of T&C Ops know so that T&C can help you and ensure that appropriate attention is paid to your situation on behalf of the management.)
Employees will get full pay per hour.
We have already said, and we are once again making a commitment to fulfill our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will get a salary based on their normal working hours during normal circumstances.
If you are sick and can't work, you will still get a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to get out of the stress associated with the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially at such times.
Once again, you need to take care of yourself.
We say that you should talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we can't stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and Grant Accumulation Teams (and others) perform highly important tasks that may require additional collaboration.
We will start a process with all departments, to assess the existing objectives and to focus our attention on supporting the essentials for our mission
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most essential projects.
By reducing the speed right now, we will avoid injury later.
We have no plans to "give double the time to compensate" after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that have passed beyond reality.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What will happen with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To be adjusted with our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we want to change the timeline to meet our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to give us more time to make a budget, so that employees can prioritize their over-important work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and those who need or want to work on a reduced timetable for the next few weeks can be accommodated.
This extension of the deadline will significantly reduce our current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will propose to the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we get confirmation, we will inform the representatives and teams about the further steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office Status, Contacts, and Cleaning
Last week we found out that one of our SF-based colleagues has probably been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with a lot of caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning crews to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank coming up to our floor from the anti-viral solution of hospital-grade.
The building is implementing its own care-duty protocol using products that support the safety of its residents.
We are confident that when we return, the office will be fully ready.
Our DC office is located in WeWork which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week, our DC Office had adopted a completely remote system in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, leasing a spot in Brooklyn is also under discussion.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home for the first time.
Our colleagues working from home/away for a long time know that this would require adjustment, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to more than one or two hour increments.
If further long sessions are necessary, consider dividing them over several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video your default choice with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and combination.
Take initiatives to facilitate every meeting, monitor chats for questions and keep an eye on the speaker list, and help a person take notes (or take notes from mutual collaborations)
Send an email to Tech Support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health reimbursement for a snack.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is investigating webinar-based labor efficiency guidance to support the growth in distributed work across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel Wikimedia-funded public programs, such as Editathon, etc., until the WHO announces the end of the global pandemic.
We told them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one would be punished for being forced to delay or amend those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and subject community conferences.
This obstacle leads to a feeling of sadness across the global community, but at the same time, they also feel relief from the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and otherwise.
Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up our communications with them.
Maintaining contact with COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend a little time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email on the Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at the moment.
If you have anything to ask about travel, events, a major workflow, or a coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with CRT.
We exist to help provide support and establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Juden, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our duties and obligations.
Rather, they are the recognition that at this time, our actions and obligations are likely to need to be adapted as we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our activities with the support they need, and provide the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
At the moment, it is time to help each other, and to make room for important work coming in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
We all need you to make this possible, and so we want you all to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when needed.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K., Amy V., Brian J., Doren D., Gregory V., Jayme V., Joel L., Linet L., Ryan M., and Tony S.), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W., Jayme V., Jenn Yu, Lisa S., Robin A., Ryan M., and Toby N.).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activation of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as the entry point in cells for certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metaloenzyme located on the surface of the interstitial and other cells.
ACE2 protein consists of N-terminal peptides M2 domain and C-terminal collectorin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a one-time crossing type I membrane protein with an enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheds, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membranes of the type II anaerobic cells of the lungs, the enterocytes of the small intestine, the interstitial cells of the artery and vein, and the soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
The ACE2 mRNA appearance is also found in the cerebral vulcott, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight of ACE.
ACE decomposes the angiotensin I hormone into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and water-decomposes it in the vessel expander angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9]- can also decompose several other peptides, including bradykinin, epalin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and grelin.
The ACE2 neutral amino acid transporter also controls the membrane transport of SLC6A19 and its role is reported in Heartnap disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-generating virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-generating virus) act as the main entry point in cells for certain coronaviruses.
More specifically, connecting to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2's Kantak S1 protein leads to endocytosis and the transfer of both viruses and enzymes to the endosomes located within the cells.
This admission process also requires inflammation of S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some people to hypothesize that lowering the level of ACE2 in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional entities and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
The methodical review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors compared to controls was associated with a significant reduction of 34% in the risk of pneumonia."
Also, the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with trauma and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered new therapy for acute lung damage, and pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in infants.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of the action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour effect process (period).
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. Distilled rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in certain areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
The less intrusive option involves the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, which was released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was waiting for approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced phase of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. A similar app ("StopCovid") has also been employed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don't get out of the house.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple determined what types of organizations could include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store, limiting only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement to borders on such surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions on government projects:
Monitoring has to be "valid, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a terminal section for supervision and monitoring expansions;
Use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data protection and anonymity should be protected and represented protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid discriminating and promoting rightslessness;
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to abuse and to abuse;
All "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and rightsless groups, will require "meaningful participation". The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grangen) (RSF) have also issued checklists.
The purpose of the proposed Google/Apple plan, when it is not needed, is to solve the problem of constant monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; many privacy-preservation systems have been created that only use the central server for mutual communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-preservation systems.
As of 6 April 2020, these details were not yet released.
Privacy-protection contact tracing with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is a well-established concept. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Protection Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all are on the matching device.
MIT is developing The Privacy Group SafePaths at Media Lab, a platform to use privacy-preservation techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar attempt is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology, which was originally established at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by groups that essentially organized in terms of the same approach and large-scale similar protocols, aimed at reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving widespread adaptation.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, companies that control Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low-energy technology and privacy-preservative cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be available in three steps:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preservation coronavirus tracing apps
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android
Drug rehabilitation (also known as drug repurposing, reprofiling, re-appointment or therapeutic change) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research instructions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusions related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides the proper project of developing effective antiviral medication to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Husain and others studied a number of candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for the similarity of their structures with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2-drug in a pre-clinical study to be recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain self-immune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that tests of New York State's chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquil phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's process of clinical trials and is only authorized under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when there is "no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed Favipiravir to be "clearly effective."
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received Fevipiravir and half received Omiphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is very small and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease, where the virus has already been multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A combination of antiviral lopinavir and Ritonavir, a study by Lopinavir/ Ritonavir (Kaletra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were created to prevent HIV from replicating by hostages from protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. Within the scientific community there are criticisms about directing resources for the re-purpose of drugs that develop specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was manufactured and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation to protect against many filo-, pneumo-, paramico- and coronavirus-viruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-test studies show that remdesivir may have a higher genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials underway, including two tests conducted by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for those with moderate disease and the other for those with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The State of New York began trials for antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), for the treatment of patients with pre-existing symptoms from the novel coronavirus, is planning a clinical trial for Tegins Alvesco (Siclesodine), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients being admitted from critical, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchisin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
6000 adults aged 40 years and above who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms do not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular weight is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian pharmaceutical agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multi-centered study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium on prophylactic and curative supplements was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purpose of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for former outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Rebavirin: Rebavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per the guidelines of the Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also tested in Italy and China. And see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, many efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine for protection from SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus,.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of security studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in April, the requirements of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create effective vaccines for protection against COVID-19.
The advanced key platform goals in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Vaccine Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are at an early stage of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others are declared, but less public information is available (designing or envisaged in planning).
Initial safety and immunogenicity tests are performed in a Phase I-II test, it is usually performed at random, placebo-controlled and multiple sites, determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects on optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Out of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was examining the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which will genetically modify viral proteins to induce immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine aiming to start human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Hayneke Schutmaker-led Yansen Pharmaceutical Company announced that it has begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Waxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership to develop the vaccine with Vaccart.
On 8 February 2020, the laboratory OncoGen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and began testing.
On 27 February 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a generics subsidiary, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a lye-key peptide vaccine for protection against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, both the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command in Fort Detroit and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of the vaccine
Will work closely with Novavac Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 detractors, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine on a speedy path as well.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus-like particles under partial financing from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, which is planned for human testing for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered Curvacas a "large amount for special learning of the COVID-19 vaccine" against which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop the mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, whose clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, an Italian biotechnology company Tacis Biotech announced that they would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and could start testing by autumn on their final vaccine candidate.
In France on 19 March 2020, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced to invest $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research association, including the Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which makes CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development $29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Kyrevac, Innovavac, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including a number of vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicaid and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing a potential COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc in rats, stating that "MNA provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have caused antigen-specific antibody reactions [in rats], which became apparent to begin 2 weeks after vaccination."
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophase, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits from the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking 4,170 health workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Early research assessing the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicates the need for bio-safety level 3 protection measures to combat the living virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection from SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments for protection against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChaDOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-MERS-S.
Social media posts have fueled a conspiracy, claiming to be aware of the virus responsible for COVID-19 and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are mild in most cases, viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop in some cases.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, often through short drops generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops arise when exhaling, they normally fall to the ground or to surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also get infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before the symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the fas of a nasopharynx.
It is recommended to use masks for those who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caregivers.
The recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others make their use necessary.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blueness of the face or lips; it is advisable to receive immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and sharp beatings were observed.
In some cases, the disease can increase to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the period of origin.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. The information shows that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these symptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, about which the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has informed that 20% of all confirmed cases remain symptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began incorporating symptomatic cases into its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of the 166 infections that day were symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can contain large amounts of viral.
Talking in a loud voice produces more drops than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that goes up to 4.5 m (15 ft) without covering can produce drops.
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Science has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors engaged in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as duct insertion and respiratory secretion due to heart pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to aerosol formation and thus airborne proliferation.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through the stool, this risk is considered low. This virus is the most contagious when people are symptomatic; although it is possible to spread before symptoms emerge, the risk of it is low.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person normally infects two to three other individuals. This virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products neutralize them by dissolving the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalisation began.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest amount of viral, and the sixth patient showed the highest amount of viral on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the most affected organs from COVID-19 as virus enzymes reach the nutrient cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in lung type II aerocellular cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "Peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Acute heart damage was found in 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China and is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to somatic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage can also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor disease diagnosis. Diarrhoea damage (DAD) in the autopsy of people dying of COVID-19 and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory external substances within the lungs have been found.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a follow-up to the ACE2-reformative epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of somatic infarction.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretory T-cells were shown to correlate with the selection of inflammatory IL-6-secretory monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published a number of testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharynx fas; however, a nasal fas or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are normally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples to be taken in a two-week interval and the results have a lower immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish genetic sequences so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person was previously infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the U.S. approved the first care-of-place test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month. Clinical guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University showed ways to detect infections based on clinical facilities and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polymorphic ground-glass ambiguities are common with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution in the initial transition.
Subpleural Dominance, Crazy Peking (thickening of the palatable walls with variable aerocellular filler) and thickening may appear when the disease progresses.
Less data is available about the microscopic lesions and disease body action of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: inflammation in the pleura, pericarditis, thickening of the lungs and pulmonary edema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be seen:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hypertrophy, large amorphous pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic interstitial and multicenter giant cell formation
Severe Pneumonia: Diarrhoea aerocytic damage (DAD) with radiated aerocytic leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short-oxygenemia.
Treating pneumonia: the arrangement of leakages and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in the anaerobic cavities
Blood: Dispersed Endometriosis Skandan (DIC); Leukoarythroblastic Reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water repeatedly and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth coverings in public arrangements to limit transmission by partially symptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with infected individuals with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The guidelines for making distance also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no drug known to be effective to prevent COVID-19. Since the vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, a significant part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is called "reducing the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands with soap and water repeatedly for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after sprinkling, coughing or sneezing their noses.
Additionally, it recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. Areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial action arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to aid in eliminating bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not an active substance for hand pimples.
Glycerol is mixed as a moisturiser.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and providing support to other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected to be infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical workers recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care arrangements, when aerosol-generating processes such as duct insertion or hand vaping are carried out.
For health personnel caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the individual in an airborne infection isolation chamber (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE chonga, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and therapeutic gloves. When available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
They are built to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness towards a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for non-approved experiments.
The CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical ventilation or other options, but in some percentage of cases the need arises.
The type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for those hospitalized, with some evidence that duct insertion can be avoided with high flow nasal ingress or two-stage positive airway pressure.
Whether one of these two provides the same benefits to seriously ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use enteric mechanical ventilation when available as this technique limits the proliferation of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are most common in older adults (aged 60 years and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of serious COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support for vaping, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical congestion becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen is progressively difficult to provide.
Pressure control systems and high PEEP-capable ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing lung damage and the risk of pneumothorax associated with ventilators.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
An attempt can be made to administer antiviral medication in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in tests of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily allowed health-beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or urgently threatened.
There are no clinical studies required to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to tackle the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contact' using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing, and artificial intelligence are used for tracing infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to trace mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
The measure was taken to implement quarantine and to protect those who came in contact with infected citizens.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared joint phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to prevent the spread and research of the virus.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect those who violated quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Gallera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and an economic downturn are an ideal storm damaging people's mental health and well-being," Rory O'Connor was quoted as saying by BBC.
The disease may have a mild process with or without some symptoms similar to common colds such as other common upper respiratory tract diseases.
Mild cases normally recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or over-severe diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in the statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
Among the most severely affected, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, sepsis trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal sclerosis and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Skandan abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group see abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospitalisation.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
The tissue deformity tests of lung samples of autopsy show radiated anaerobic damage with cell fibromycoid leakages in both lungs.
Cell pathology changes from viral to viral were observed in pneumocytes.
The lung picture appeared similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Among 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or heart rate pauses.
According to US March statistics, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. Availability of medical resources and the socio-economic status of an area could also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the situation vary due to those regional differences and also due to system-related difficulties.
The mortality rate may be overestimated due to low count of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of pre-existing cases may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and the need for intensive care or death was about 2.4 times more likely. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term post-morbidity symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans expressed organ damage.
It can also cause intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but positive test cases for coronavirus have been reported at a date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse of a untreated infection rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be of an animal origin that spreads from natural and animal to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely caused by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was reported as December 1, 2019.
WHO official publications reported the earliest onset of symptoms December 8, 2019.
Many measures are used in general to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the timing of the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO prescribed emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
The number varies by region. Other measures include Case Mortality Rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of individuals diagnosed with a disease, and the Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) that shows the percentage (diagnosed and not diagnosed) of infected individuals dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to case recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of an immune can provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the center of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglion d'Ada, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
At Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and to young people, reducing the relatively mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths could have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system is not crumbling.
In the Netherlands, about 3% can be immune, according to an evaluation from blood donors.
The death toll from COVID-19 has been confirmed to be 69 (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown higher mortality rates in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is reduced to only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact causes of this gender-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, reduced prevalence of smoking in women and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as hypertension at a younger age than women can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not tracking gender-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pointed out that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people that are in line with international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing degrading. The virus that generates COVID-19 is called the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses the "COVID-19 virus" and the "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus" and the "Wuhan Coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov acute respiratory disease as interim names for viruses and disease, which comply with the 2015 guidelines of not using locations in disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as Nasika Fah and ventilators.
In an example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilate valve, and the supplier was unable to provide in the required time-frame, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level, prevention, treatment and other parties of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the healing effects of the four most likely antiviral compounds of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at the moment, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being examined.
First, the researchers aim to build an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a quick immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain sub-parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-pink proteins that help the virus penetrate into the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique of vaccine making).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies have to be tested for safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-generating virus. Antibody dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being carried out by April 2020.
Seven tests were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Due to be reported by the end of April, with nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir in many countries, most Chinese research is working on reusable antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical development was underway for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of Remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine already used for the treatment of malaria was studied in February 2020 with initial results in China.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommended a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice that dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use permit for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further study in organisms after showing low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early sting protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
There are major limitations of studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further study. Ostamivir does not suppress artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the growth of cytokine. Tolkilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 non-randomized testing at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify an increase in the amount of cytokine, it aims to cope with such increases, which are considered to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The Interleukin-6 receptor was approved by the FDA in 2017, for a different reason, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractive cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy.
To this day there is no randomized, controlled evidence that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral apathy is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health-beneficial serums, which contain the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and have specific antibodies to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at Wuhan's central hospital who was infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
