Welsh AM (assembly member) is worried about 'muppet-like images'
Some of the members of the Assembly are at odds with the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Welsh).
The reason for this is that a plan has been made to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
All AMs associated with the realm of politics are concerned that this can make fun of them.
A Labour AM said that his group was concerned about "not linking it to TWP and PWP."
For readers living outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
One Plaid AM said the whole group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A Welsh political party said its group was "independent" about the change of name, but noted that the MWP could be muffled by verbally minor changes in words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u in Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal change of name, said: "The final decision of any descriptor in regard to what members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter of their own for the members."
According to the Wales Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported the results of public consultation on proposals that had received much support to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of AM post, the Commission supported Welsh MPs or WMPs, but got the most support MWP option in public advice.
Obviously, AM is suggesting several other options, but the Presiding Officer is having a lot of difficulty getting a consensus for Ellen Jones, he hopes to submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
The legislation that is being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the work methods in the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of AM and the draft committee system.
At the time of debating law-making, AM will receive the last vote on the question of what they should be called.
The people of Macedonia are going to get a vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote for whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The bid for popular voting was made to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province also named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name speaks of its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a rival to the referendum on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zave as well as supporters of the referendum have argued that the change of name is only a means of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are decreasing due to churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, "The elders I spoke to for things related to history say that there used to be bars and churches at every nook and corner before."
Today, everything is coming to an end.
It makes sense to be short of the bar.
Nowadays, the society of the people is being formed in a different way.
The bars are no longer like the living room in the neighborhood where people go every day.
For churches, they worry that spending from the money they sell won't last as long as leaders expected, "and soon these money will be over or later those leaders will come to exactly where they started."
He added that churches may have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings that have a variety of people who will not help secure the remaining places of worship nearby.
These buildings will continue to grow in number of people who are buying houses built in it as a proprietary right and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely shut down, because it is unlikely that most of these people who are coming in will become members of these churches.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin, both churches were built by the Gore people of religious society before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - Metropolitan Community.
The original whites of the Methodist religious society moved in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of religious society who used to worship in nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was occupied by a black religious society under that pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of retailers on 125th Street, the place was the prime place for shopping in Harlem, opposed to hiring or promoting black people here.
The building was badly damaged due to the fire in 1939, but after planning to rebuild it by the followers of Father Johnson, the hour began to ring here.
Father Johnson's son and successor to Saint Martin, Pastor David Johnson, proudly called the hour-playing work "opening the doors of fortune for the poor."
The expert who played the hour in July described it as follows: It is "a cultural heritage" and "a precious historical instrument."
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first hour in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a huge hour at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the church's common leaders and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The parish (the pastors of the locality) made up of common leaders on the vesti (where the items of worship are placed) became the authority - concerns were raised in the province in July that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for the vesti, regardless of whether or not the vesti joined in appointing the craftsmen and contractors appointed in the province.
Some pastors in the area complained of lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old teenager was injured by an attack by a shark diving to catch a crab
Officials say on Saturday, a 13-year-old teenager was attacked and injured by a shark, who was holding a crab while diving into California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near Beacon Beach in Ancinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, from the KSWB-TV in San Diego, said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time hearing a boy screaming for help and then reaching out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that first he felt like the boy had sounded in the excitement of catching a crab, but then he realized that he was yelling, 'I'm biting something!'
I'm cutting something!'
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire throat had burst.
Hummel said, "I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to the Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles told the media in a conversation that a few weeks ago a shark was detected in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Gilles further said that the upper place of the victim's torso was seriously injured.
Authorities for investigation and security purpose have stopped access from Ponto Beach in Casblad to Swamis Beach in Acinitas for 48 hours.
Gilles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
The department is going to incorporate store-style boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by appointing expert assistants with Sainsbury's Beauty Products.
Despite the continuing decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, it is going to join the UK's Â£2.8 billion beauty market with good volumes, with these massive amounts of beauty products to be tested across 11 stores across the country and if the plan succeeds, business on more stores will be ramped up next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that this will double the number of products it offers by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand somewhat faster in small-town shoppers.
Additionally, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also check the special facility in two stores in Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second one is scheduled to open later this year in Celie Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e., supermarkets, to reduce the amount of food sold every day.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said people would come more quickly like department stores at the outlet as supermarket chains are trying to compete with more services and non-food exempters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has been setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of stores since it brought the two to rest two years ago, suggesting that grocery sales have been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by supermarkets to re-market beauty and pharmacy products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's had done business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end this mixed business due to the way the proceeds from drugstores in their supermarkets split.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy Chain, for Â£125 million, followed by the new strategy.
Lloyds will play a key role in the planning of four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty products, so as to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues who will help us in advising.
We've built our brand's scope to fit every individual's need and attractive surroundings and in convenient places, which means we've reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones expresses 'happiness' over Holi Villubi's split from Â£11 million deal
When TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to part ways with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business for a Â£11 million deal to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones showed a "disgust" at it.
Bilubi doesn't have any time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
Both of these businesses were being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced her separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi distanced herself from her lucrative lifestyle brand business with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones at the last moment - so that she could fully focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones' business headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she is getting separated from her new deal - which is worth 1.5 million pounds - Jones expressed outrage at this, which means that Bilubi no longer has enough time to give away their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was considering doubling it by an estimated 11 million pounds offered by Vilubi.
The 37-year-old Vilubi announced on Instagram that she was really getting separated, after which Jones left the UK to go to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was believed to be its long-term future, making the brand much ahead in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone associated with this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to the start.
The warehouse located in the Marlowe headquarters is full of goods that are to be sold."
Experts believe that the separation of the UK's richest star, this morning presenter, could lead to a loss of several million to the firm as it has invested a lot in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and this is also likely to be delayed.
At the same time, it can also end a long friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Vilubi started with Cap in 2016 and joined it as the 52-year-old Jones chairman in March.
Baldwin's TV production firm has a 40 percent stake in couples and Jones who are vacationing together.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be placed in the place of Ant McPartlin to host I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
We don't want to talk about their business case," a source close to Jones told reporters last night.
Serious Talks "And Then We Agreed"
He mocked criticism, saying that news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it a "partisan job" and would become too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump sacrificed so much?
Trump told in his exhibitionist "News Anchor" Voice.
I didn't give up."
He said Kim is interested in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, with a major step taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free.
But, nuclear-free negotiations were halted.
After more than three months of the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not waiting for a "consistent response" from the U.S. to initiate North Korea's disarmament steps.
He said the U.S. continued to pressurize to maintain sanctions instead.
Trump's rally speech saw a very optimistic outlook.
We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people were killed.
Now our relationship has become very good.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - including completing rocket tests, helping free hostages, and bringing the remaining US troops back to their homes.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people from outside the country are trying to get involved in this area, we'll only have about 200 people to stop them," Trump said, apparently pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroys an island, hundreds of people die
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them for the incident.
Despite more than 10 percent of Lombok's population being devastated, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition for international aid.
In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they were not seeking international help, so it became somewhat more challenging.
Nevertheless, Save the Children teamed up with a team to visit Palu, but it is yet to be ascertained whether employees from other countries can come here to help.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were taking stock of the situation in Palu, observing whether international agencies would allow the contribution of the aid effort.
In view of such situations coming up in Indonesia again and again, it seems that there is no preparation at all for the outbreak of nature in this country.
Although shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunami in Aich, they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Palu has seen a decrease in sirens warning for tsunamis, no matter how harmful that warning may be, it is likely to increase life damage.
Regardless of the best time to visit, it is challenging to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Managing employees and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment, which is far away from Palu and it takes at least three days to get here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's very bad infrastructure an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, Mr. Joko's administration was disbanded due to lack of funds as elections are due again next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than ten thousand were homeless, as Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge sympathizes with Chelsea in a mysterious way
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from being knocked out of the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute.
Sturridge got close to Zerdan Shakiri from a distance of about 30 yards, at that time his team was trailing 1-0 from the Chelsea goal.
He hit the ball with his left leg before making a shot of the far post.
His effort went to the right top corner of the net with height above the box.
Eventually the ball fell out of the grip of Kepa Arizablaga and went into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "It was just an attempt to get in touch with the ball and take it as far as possible from players like Shawk, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself."
I noticed that Kante was coming and touched once and didn't think too much about it and just hit the shot."
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in halftime after the Belgian great Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached near midfield and Liverpool reached the half game, the Blues striker gave a pass to Matteo Kovacic in that game.
Covasik delivered the ball to the midfield very quickly.
Then, he beautifully shot the ball, leaving the Hazard in the box.
Hazard stepped out of the defense and shot off the net from behind Liverpool's Alison Baker with the left leg.
Liverpool will now face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.

The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, it was re-recorded in history
Its exile would be the ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, such as its Taliban, created by his radical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society reported Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate on the removal of statues had the full potential that Oliver Cromwell's statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
No orders were given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell would have sacrificed for the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, Cromwell's finest representation is evidence of the 19th-century idea and part of the history of an idol that many still consider admirable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Chromewell is respected by many, perhaps because of this reason most people still know him as a defender of Parliament against outside pressures in the late 19th century in the case of monarchy.
Nevertheless, he is considered to be the exact representative, which historically remains the subject of debate.
It is evident that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and the statue of Cromwell remains a personal identity with a glimpse of one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are laudable and memorable.
Deadly Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer That Killed Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that only his nickname "Yuan" has been identified as the man, his body was found in serious injuries, his body was found in a blood-soaked area near the boar-bound market in Lipansui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig enclosure.
Reportedly, he came on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market with his cousin living in nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that a pig-fence door was open nearby.
He said that there was a large male pig in the pig enclosure, which had blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiyang Evening News, her cousin with the nickname "Wu" said, "My cousin's legs were bleeding and completely injured."
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that killed him by attacking the person was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the boar was kept closed so that it could not attack a person, although the police collected evidence taking stock of the scene.
Reportedly Yuan's family members and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
However, earlier also rare cases of pigs attacking people have been registered.
In 2016, a boar in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their farm causing a person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound-weight boar attacked a Welsh farmer, at that time he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife drove the animal in fear.
In 2012 an Oregon farmer was attacked by his pigs to kill him and made his own food, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but that they can be "dangerous" when they get a taste of blood.
They're just playing.
They bite from the tooth and are very searching...they are not meant to injure you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remainder of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rains in Southwestern America
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is becoming weaker as Mexico's northern coast goes over cold water.
However, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
According to Eastern Time on Sunday, the wind speed recorded at 5 am in Rosa was 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, and it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and it is heading towards the west coast of the US. Since, Rosa is about to reach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, much of the tropical moisture will begin to flow into the northern parts of Southwestern America.
On Monday, some parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain due to Rosa.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest consisting of tropical moisture.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will lead to dangerous flooding, debris drift and landslides in the desert.
Too much tropical moisture will cause the rainfall rate to rise to 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona, is likely to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can cause a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
Given the risk of tropical rainfall, it would be highly advisable to stay out of the low-level desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become risky rivers and with the thundering of the cloud, strong winds and dust will blow in the local areas.
Due to the approaching trough, some parts of the southern California coast will receive a lot of rain locally.
A total of more than half an inch is likely to rain, which can lead to some degree of debris drifting and a situation of slipping on the roads.
This will be the first rain of the humid season in the area.
There will be some sporadic tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in the month of October as the Arctic weather cools down at this time, but tropical regions remain fairly hot.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange changes in temperature.
The peculiar change in temperature in the Central U.S. on Sunday is a good example.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the weather will begin to warm up and the heat will increase.
The weather is expected to warm up from October in most areas of the Central and Eastern U.S., which could be widespread 80s in some areas of the northeast, from the southern plains.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees, which will be about 10 degrees above the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting a signal that there are plenty of opportunities for eastern U.S. temperatures to stay above average in the early six months of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who has accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly carried out in the 1980s, the woman's name is Christine Blasey Ford, shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlocks were also observed, with broadcasters blocking Friday's Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen's regular program. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after investigating charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely sure that at a high school party, Cavanaugh had tried to intoxicate him and take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
More than 20.4 million people are expected to see Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data for PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, as well as other channels showing it, did not exist quickly.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating people who see in offices.
From this point of view, this playoff is equivalent to the number of viewers of a football game or academy award.
Nielsen pointed out that the Fox News channel, which the host considered, has greatly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, was ahead of all channels, with an average audience of 5.69 million during the entire day's hearing.
The audience on ABC was 3.26 million and it finished second.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
People were very interested in hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
A statement was issued after the moderate Republican office said they would raise their voice on behalf of Cavanaugh, who appeared in front of CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when protesters were shouting to protest the hearing of the judicial committee.
When they were being abused, they stood with their eyes bowed for a few minutes at that time, it was watched live on CNN.
One woman said, "Here I am standing in front of you."
Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
He was asked, "Have you been brought to power so that you make a lot of women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued from his office before the elevator was closed and that he would be able to speak at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was pushing Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But, Fleck said he would do so with a full understanding that the FBI will look into the allegations against the nominees next week, which is being urged by the minority Democrats.
Fleck spoke about this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After negotiating with Coons and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck loved power, as it was clearly visible that the Republicans would not be able to get a vote by approving Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of doing politics over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May asked critics to stop messing with Britain's future by making politics a "game" in the European Union and focus their full attention on national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attend the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
Right next to his interview on the front page of the newspaper, the interview with his former foreign minister Boris Johnson was printed in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him because of Brexit's so-called Checkers Plan, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other which is "completely meaningless."

Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
An ash from the popocepetal volcano has been found in the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano and reported that 183 gas and ash had been released in 24 hours.
A number of shocks and vibrations were monitored by the centre.
Photos posted on social media showed thin layers of ash coating car windshields visible in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico, such as Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Central Mexico, since then geophysicists have noted the increasing activity of volcanoes that lie 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six Barcelona people were detained on Saturday after a pro-independence protesters clash with riot police, and thousands of rivals joined demonstrations on the first anniversary celebrated in Catalonia to vote on segregation.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paint on the riot police, which turned the road dust black, usually causing trouble to the traffickers.
The police used their batons to control the clashes and later scrambled.
Pro-independence groups chanted "no forgotten, no forgiveness" for several hours while federal protesters chanted "Spain remained immortal."
According to a local press report, 14 people who were injured due to the protest were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, considered illegal, has been escalating tensions in areas of independent thought for a year, but people with Catalonia's secessionist views were celebrating it.
Voters chose a very good way to freedom, though there were few who strongly opposed the vote against segregation.
Catalonia officials said about 1000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from moving to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Groups supporting freedom had stayed there overnight on Friday to assist the National Police to stop the protests.
The performance was pushed forward, but he was forced to take a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narciss Terminus had arrived with his wife to participate in the separatist protests, saying he did not see any possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
Our best sala has been last year.
I had seen my parents express happiness by voting, but it seems like we are stuck now," he said.
Despite a minor victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence with many of their famous leaders this year, whether it was to expose themselves or to wait for the referendum to be organized and a barrier to its role for a sustained declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to assist the police, said the conflict between the politicians of the two sides had been stopped.
It has become very stressful, he said.
On Saturday, Orol Junqueres, one of Catalonia's nine leaders involved in the pre-trail prison since last year, announced that he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
Fighting European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and condemn the withdrawal that we have seen in the Spanish government.
London derry: People who attacked home by car detained
Three people aged 33, 34 and 39 have been detained for repeatedly attacking a London derry house with a car.
The incident took place at BST at around 19:30 pm on Thursday in Ballinagard Crescent.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings said that the doors and buildings of the house were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by the car.
Menga beat Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's win
According to the manager of the Ebrox Club, Livingston, who is on the move, shocked the Rangers, forcing Steven Gerard to take responsibility for his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with Hiberian in the second half of the match.
Gerard's side was one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders Harts, who are trailing by eight points next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, last month, Livingston has been winning consecutively in the six-game division by replacing Kenny Miller with head coach Holt.
Livingston missed out on showing his game to the visitor
Long before scoring, Holt's team should have gone ahead, as well as, because of his great game, Rangers had a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by an attempt to score the goal, then Alan Lithgow was able to remain just direct in his best effort after sliding so as to complete the goal in Craig Lightl's header.
The hosts had a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in trouble on the set piece.
And that's why he scored an important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston did the opening, the Declan Gallagher and Robinson did the job of setting up Menga, who did a touch and score from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left behind,
This pattern continued even in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on Kelly to be saved.
Scott Pittman's shot was intercepted by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor with his feet and Lithgow took full possession of the game by flicking from another livingston.
Crosses in the Livingston box continued to come and go until the goal was scored, while two penalty claims were made after the lightweight challenge, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
Analysis of Livingston's 'extraordinary goal'
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's exceptional performance and result.
For any individual, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectories.
His game style and personality have changed amazingly since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to Holt's way in which he has given the team a new look since his arrival.
There were many great players in it.
Captain Halket was a great player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Connor Golden and Joe Warle entangled behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in the Rangers.
The kind of fine performance he has performed several times under Gerard was less than his standard.
His final ball was lacking - he was only able to cut towards his home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan was welcomed in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles scattered but found no use.
This is President Erdogan's last day on a controversial visit to Germany - which aims to improve relations with NATO allies.
He was embroiled in controversy over a number of issues, including human rights, press freedom, and Turkey's deportation to the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke on the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, the city is one of the areas where the majority of Turkish residents live.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, some of whom belonged to Kurds, also raised slogans, strongly condemned Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero, and the others insulted him as a voluntary ruler.

Long Latin Prison: Six Officers Injured Due to Disturbances
The prison office said six jail officials were injured due to a prison disturbance in high-security men.
At around 09:30 BST on Sunday, HMP Long Latin in Worcestershire suffered some disturbance and continues so far.
Specialist "Tornado" officers have been called to fix the disturbance, this disturbance is in a wing in which eight prisoners have been placed.
There were minor injuries on the face of the rights at the scene which were treated.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been put in place to fix the accident in HMP Long Lartin.
The injuries of six employees have been treated.
We do not tolerate violence in our jails at all, and it is obvious that the persons responsible for the violence will be sent to the police and they can be imprisoned.
More than 500 prisoners are in HMP Long Lartin, some of these prisoners are the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the governor of a prison was attacked by a prisoner, after which the governor of a prison was treated at the hospital.
In addition, in October last year rioting officers were called to jail to fix a serious disorder, during which the employee was attacked from the pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa causes high flood risk in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (drought areas may benefit)
There is a danger in tropical areas after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is already very likely that this is what could affect the remaining capacity of the storm to the Desert Southwest in the coming week, which poses a risk of flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, in western Arizona, are expected to receive severe flooding.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to leave Rosa directly through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950 have maintained a tropical storm or depression state!"
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Hurricane Aged range."
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has predicted that Arizona's Mogolone rim can rain from 2 to 4 inches, as well as it is expected to be up to 6 inches.
Other regions of the Desert Southwest, along with Central Rockies and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, as well as 4 inches of it.
Outside of high flood-risk areas, Rosa's rain can prove to be a boon as the area is dry.
Though the floods continue to be a very serious concern, there is still a drought in Southwest, which is likely to benefit a lot from the rains.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just 40 percent of Arizona's area is very dry, it's the second-highest category of drought," said the weather.com report.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
On Sunday morning, the maximum wind speed of Hurricane Rosa was 85 miles per hour, at that time it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it is currently moving northwards at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is currently in the cold water of the Pacific region due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of tropical storms could create a landslide situation in Mexico on Monday afternoons or evenings.
There is a possibility of heavy rain in some areas of Mexico, which can increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by weather.com, "It is expected that the Baja California to northwestern Sonora may receive 3 to 6 inches of rain, as well as, it is also expected to have 10 inches."
After that Rosa will move across Mexico on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border northward, after which it will move southward into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The biggest threat from Rosa or its leftovers is to the Baja California, Northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rains are likely," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that due to these rains, people's wealth is at risk due to the high flood and debris flow in the deserts and landslides can occur in the hilly areas.
Attack in Midsummer Norton: Four people detained for conspiracy to murder
A 16-year-old minor was found injured in Somerset, attacked with a knife for which three teenage boys suspected and a 20-year-old man have been detained in a conspiracy to commit murder.
The teenage boy was found injured on Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital for treatment where his condition is stated to be "right".
Avon and Somerset police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were detained at night from the Redstock area.
Authorities have also appealed to people to contact a person if they have any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump calls Kavanaugh's trouble a Democratic party's anger
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, "Justice Kavanaugh is a person who has been denied by the Democratic Party's ruthless and abusive tactics."
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting Kavanaugh several decades ago during his teenage years, while clearing Kavanaugh has forcefully and emotionally denied this.
Ford also testified about the allegation during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, "The inhabitants of America saw the quality and courage of being the finest human being of Kavanaugh that day."
Speaking to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "Voting Judge Kavanaugh means voting for a person who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, can confirm the law and do justice to the actual record of public service."
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
It is now only five weeks away from the election that is most important to our lives.
I am not involved, but in reality I am involved," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are truly qualified."
Trump said Democrats are on the campaign to "protest and block."
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the Senate's first vote in Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to begin on Friday.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami kills hundreds, death toll rises
On Saturday, officials said that when a huge earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi's Indonesian island, high-rise waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu city in which hundreds of people gathered, after the evening, when six meters (18 feet) high waves rose, it had wreaked havoc, which led to the death of many people and also ruined everything around them.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
At the briefing in Jakarta, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said: "When the tsunami risked yesterday, the people at the beach were engaged in their activities and not immediately in a position to leave and get stuck in it."
The tsunami did not just cause people's deaths, it also pulled cars, logs and homes to the ground. Before the beach was attacked, the tsunami travelled at an open sea speed of 800 km per hour (497 mph), Nugroho said.
He said that some people climbed trees to protect themselves from the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres of Palu.
Photos posted by the Disaster Agency from the airplane showed that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have turned and collapsed, and a mosque is also surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the subsequent shock in the coastal city continued on the rocks.
2.4 million people in the area experienced a frequent earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy potential caused by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It pointed out that the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho elaborated on the damage and said it was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people were yet to be identified.
Nugroho said that near the epicenter of the earthquake, near Palu, there is a high probability of loss of life and damage in the area called Dongala, 300 kilometres (190 miles) north of Palu.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongla was "completely damaged."
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its employees and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It is already a tragic event, but it can be even more terrible.
On Saturday, the agency criticised why it was not informed earlier if a tsunami was to hit Palu, although officials said the warning was to be issued but the waves had already passed.
Amateurly created some videos by a person and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was giving a person a voice to the people present on the street below and a frightening warning can be heard in it.
Within a few minutes, a lot of water started flowing out of the middle and the buildings and cars also started pulling with them.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut lines of communication making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
Authorities have started sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials said, adding that there is still a need to evacuate people and meet other requirements along with food.
The city airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll due to Indonesia tsunami rose to over 800.
It's very terrible.
Mr. Dosaba said that the World Vision staff at Donggla tried their best to make the city of Palu safe, the staff living there by making tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have seen with their own eyes the devastation.
Speaking to him, he said, "It was revealed that he saw a lot of houses being destroyed."
It's very terrible.
The aid groups began the work of bringing goods for disaster relief seriously, with some people complaining that outside aid workers with special expertise were being denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesia rules, funds, goods and staff from abroad can only be taken if the disaster zone is declared as a national disaster zone.
But that hasn't been done yet.
Auliya Ariyani, a Red Cross spokesman based in Indonesia, said, "This disaster is still at the province level."
After the government said it was a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in rescue operations but that has not happened yet.
Even after Friday's earthquake and the second night of the tsunami, people whose friends and family members had not been detected in Palu expected that their loved ones would be found miraculously somewhere, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team rescued a woman from the rubble on Sunday and her child was trapped in the rubble for two days next to her.
The Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gandon Subando trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to locate the lost ones, who had been dedicated to it since early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi was also among the people stranded at Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
I am also emotionally suppressed as a senior in the paragliding field.
Mr. Gendon said that the paragliding community started their work only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, they had sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu competitors participating in the beach festival.
However, only gray marks are visible on their message, there are no blue marks on it.
I think that means the message could not reach the people.

Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to
rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Formally his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has named it for some time and will use the name for his eighth album titled Moniker, released in June.
This change is being made in his presence at Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandi.
The producer of the show revealed that he has removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already pointed out that the term has religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, West had said, "I believe the term 'Ye' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
This word is derived from Kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it reflects our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album depicts who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has kept his names Love and Brother Love while announcing for the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilian civilians
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed that the military force will no longer be used for civilian civilians after the country completed 50 years for deadly retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised that "military forces will never be used to put pressure on Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at the peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, when left-wing student movements were spreading all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support Mexico's youth, provide grants to students studying every month and open as many free government universities as possible.
He said that due to lack of opportunities to get unemployment and education, the youth join the people who commit crime.
U.S. should double funding for AI
Kai-Fu Li, a low investor and AI businessman for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said, Since China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research spent on this field.
After a series of actions by the U.S. government, AI made the remark, saying the U.S. lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: It aims to reach No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, take a look at all the other countries apart, the U.S. is far behind the case, and we are striving for AI's next success," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Doubling funds can double the likelihood that AI's next big achievement will be in the U.S.."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the Hutton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, an investor of Face++, one of China's best AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AI system at Carnegie Mellon University that left the highest ranked American Othello player far behind, and later he was appointed executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google's China branch.
Lee described the previous U.S. government's technical qualifications, including the robot related challenges of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and who would be the next government to recognize the next visionary.
Lee said that researchers in the U.S. often face a lot of difficulties to get government help.
It's not China that removes academic leaders, it's corporate," Lee said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said changes to the immigration policy could help the U.S. in its AI efforts.
According to me, the permission to do PhD in AI through a green card should be given automatically.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
In the same way that China's National Natural Science Foundation funds the people of the academic institute, the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give economic grants to researchers from the U.S., but the quality of the teaching work in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aimed at involving industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA launched an initiative named AI Next which talked about investments worth $2 billion.
For NSFs, this investment is currently over $100 million each year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation was enacted in the U.S. that the demand for creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
The people of Macedonia voted for whether the country would be renamed or not
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, a work that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, due to which Greece banned its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province named Macedonia, which says its northern neighbour is named after its territory, which has made two names for the same claim and is already involved in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the suggested new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said the change of Macedonia's name would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in the Slavic region.
President George Ivanov said he would not go to vote in a referendum and boycott the campaign, adding he suspected that only a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes required for this vote would be valid.
The question would be written on the voting ballot: "Do you approve of your agreement with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU?"
Proponents of the change of name, along with Prime Minister Zoran Zave, say that it is necessary for Macedonia to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, it is one of the countries that has emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for young people in Macedonia, this will allow them to live freely under the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska, who lives in Skopje.
While it is not being legally insisted on, most members of Parliament say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities were reported till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, voting was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent registered voters voting.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gozo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in Skopje, the capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zave along with his wife Zorica and his son Dushko went to vote in Macedonia for a change in the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018, the country's name in Tromica, Macedonia joins NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Coverdarkov, who hails from Skopje in front of Parliament, was preparing a small stage and was setting up chairs in front of the tents planted by those who oppose the vote.
We must subscribe to NATO and the EU, but we want to raise our heads and join it, not through an agreement.
Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don't want to subscribe to us in the name of Macedonia, it doesn't matter, we can join other countries like China and Russia as part of Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zave has said that membership in NATO will give much-needed investment to Macedonia, with the unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zave said, "I think a lot of vote positivity will come as more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He pointed out that the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
Last Monday, a survey published by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of the voters would participate in the necessary voting.
The second survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of them, 70 percent of people agree to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the voting is required to be successful.
If the voting fails, the Western government's policy to be formed in May last year will suffer the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling made a lot of defense from Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England.
Ridiculously Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield in the early stages.
As soon as he entered the open field, he got defense from three bright players.
After that Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a player defending before moving further from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, Aguero beat Brighton Keeper Matthew Ryan using his left boot and the ball left his right side and went into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, "Aguero's feet have had some problems that upset him."
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time.
But, it was because of Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League encounter.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero got a ball deep in Brighton's field.
He pulled the ball from the left side of Leroy Sen from the beautiful.
Sen touched something before sending Sterling away playing great.
Sky Blues tapped the ball forward just before the game slipped by hand.
The Champions League group play match will now take place at 12:55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhine-Necker-Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
Shazer wants to beat him by playing against the Rockies
After the end of the playoffs dispute with the Nationals, there was no major reason to insist on another start.
But, the always-competing skater hopes to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoff for the Rockies still remains the only possibility, winning the game played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies won 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday night to get a wild-card spot, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
Even though we aren't playing great, we can at least play to learn that the crowd and the second-team Denver environment will probably be for the highest level of play I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals are yet to tell about the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that in such a situation the Schizer can be included.
Shazer, who played for his 34th start, risked a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right hander finished at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm election, the President referred to the situation around his Supreme Court in Lect Kavanaugh.
All the work we do will be at stake in November.
It is now only five weeks away for the most important election of our lives.
This is a huge election - I am not involved in it, but I am really involved, because I am fighting for all the great candidates.
Trump further added, "You can take a look at this much more terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see everything that's happening right now."
In addition, they are trying to grab power using other necessary means, which you know is pointless and pointless.
To get power and control, they don't care who is unhappy, who is capable of it, they just want power and control to get them, but we won't let that happen."
The campaign of the Democrats is "opposed and obstructed", he said.
In addition, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you have seen the anger of the Democrats and also how mean and bad they are.
He mentioned the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein by referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was praised by the audience strongly.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for that -- whose body language was really bad -- such a bad body language I saw for the first time."
Working is no longer a broad church.
For those who speak their mind, it is not worth it to tolerate
When the activists who led my local party voted for me to choose, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among the labour parliamentarians who have little importance - we cannot say the whole thing in our minds.
My MP colleague Joan Ryan also happened here because she also raised her voice for anti-socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, Europe had similar problems in a sarcastic manner to which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Meeting was said on Friday that "we wish that all things are included in the meeting and these be beneficial."
During my eight years as a local labour MP, I mostly saw that Friday night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of the "kind and gentle people" are really forgotten, here also happened.
It is evident that if the views in the Labour Party are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration it is decided whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, with colleagues for whom I had previously thought they had political opinions like mine, hoping that I would overturn my point of view and work in positions I could never agree with - whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I raise my voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made on it, center politics is condemned and I'm told I'm not worthy of the Labour Party.
Moreover, that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I am aware of the way businesses work and dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don't shy away from raising a voice.
There are many disappointing aspects in today's political era, one of which is how to normalize the levels of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that the Labour Party needed to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and that every offer of "no-confidence" or the changes that take place in the party's selection rule have been greatly reduced.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to be silent, not to speak much and then I will be considered "right."
But, I didn't come into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was associated with labour as a school student, I was instigated to oppose the Thatcher government, I was told to completely abandon the wider classroom of my school, I demanded better public services to those who needed them the most - whether as a local councilor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed any of my politics, including the politics I did in the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area disagrees with my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards Brexit that damages homes, businesses and our public services, I do not consider it necessary for the Labour Party to waste my time and energy in showing my sincerity.
But, in reality, I have a message that is not meant for Nottingham Momentum, it is meant for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to be serving you and I promise that no intractable risk or political campaign in my work can create a barrier, I am only interested in things that are of interest to you all.

Aire 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Aire Arrives at the Top
The two late attempts may have a somewhat impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Iron Tennant was entitled to a win in this best entertaining match of the Premiership.
Now they are just at the top of the ten undefeated side tables.
In the end, his defence was excellent, he found the best opportunity he could have, which led to the home team being pushed forward and giving coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
We thoroughly examined our game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy."
Robin Christie of Melrose explained: "The credit for this goes to Ayre, who redeemed his opportunity as much as possible."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute forced Frazier Clemo to appear before Ayre, but was given a yellow card by the Warriors to Scotland player Rory Hughes for the game, which Melrose had the chance to score and Jason Bagen cashed in on a very difficult attempt.
With the help of penalty just before half-time, Klimo extended Ayre, he scored the goal and then tried to unilaterally match 17-5 for Ayre at the time of break.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was converted into a goal by Baggot, reducing Leew's five points.
After that, Rudieh Knott suffered a serious injury that had to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the start of the game Ayre went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowell, which was converted into a goal by Klimo.
At the time, Aire's team captain Blair McPherson received a yellow card, and then at the end of the game due to too much pressure, Melrose gave an effort to extra man Bruce Colvin who failed to capitalize on it.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struen Hutchinson got the yellow card from penalty line-out due to facing the Klimo of the Billa Ball, McPherson took the touch down, pushing Ireland from behind.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth attempt, Klimo turned it into a goal, as they could when the game resumed.
Game stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to get into the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with the famous BBC show Jarvis, in which he works as a writer and has long been associated with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Both have stated that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the show's world, and it seems that what Kiernan has to do after Craiglang is they are planning to do it.
Based on the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kiernan was looking to connect with a "good restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
We have the right to the sea': Land-restricted Bolivia expects the court to reopen its way to the Pacific
Military-navigators are patrolling extensively in the Naval Headquarters of La Paz.
The Ocean-Blue flag is being hoisted on government buildings.
Here is a slogan from the naval base stretching from Lake Titicaca to Amazon: "We have a right over the sea.
It is our duty to get it back.
Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible struggle for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they once again want to wave their flag in the Pacific Ocean.
He now hopes to reclaim his Bolivian land decades ago as it awaits a verdict from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
There is a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia now, there is a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is going to have a positive result," said Roberto Callazila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many people in Bolivia will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the verdict that will come from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - Chile has been forced to return Bolivia's land to the sea through negotiations.
Bolivia's best president Evo Morales - who is set to face a controversial contest in the next year's re-election - has also expressed this positive in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he had said, "We are very close to getting the Pacific Ocean back."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's interest - and if the decision comes in its interest, there will be a lot of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to reward the province of Chile, and has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
Paz Zret, a Chilean expert at the International Court of Justice, said the ICJ's decision is set to come six months after the final talks, which indicate that the case was not "complicated."
In addition, aside from Bolivia's terms, the last four years have seemed that it might come back to the old situation again.
The issue of access to the sea has been prevented by the current government of Bolivia.
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had put an end to Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision comes.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other's country.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltz, a representative in the Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an opportunity to "open new avenues of relations with Chile" and to "end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefits," he said.
Calizilla has rejected that Morales - who is still one of the most famous presidents of Latin America - was doing politics over the maritime problem.
Bolivia will never back down for its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
The decision is an opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past.
North Korea has said that nuclear inspections will not be stopped until it has confidence in the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until Washington is trusted.
Ri delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He asked the United States to fulfil the promises made during the summit in Singapore between leaders of other countries.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo looks like he is about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong Un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that would assume North defeat by sanctions and U.S. objection to the announcement of the end of the Korean War.
Washington is wary of the consensus of an already significant disarmament campaign without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump wish to have another summit.
But, it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to risk the country's security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit to be held on the wishes of both Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show featured a variety of newly designed headwear for your nearest high street
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, there is no need to wait long.
Both Valentino and Thom Brown have created a series of finest headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that featured at the famous Paris Fashion Week of the special style.
The best-in-class hats are designed to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show on the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with a wide brim of wings that hung around the head of the model.
The second accessory with a very large side included a waterlooman hat made in a bezeled design, a wizard hat, and a hat with a pineapple design - but they're not designed to protect your head from frost.
Thom Brown also showed special design masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colourful masks and things like Hannibal lecturers were seen more than Haute Couture.
One creation saw all sorts of stuff for scuba diving, including snowbells and glasses, while the other creation saw a melting ice cream cone design.
Also, if you've seen a bigger fashion - you're lucky.
Style-watching amateurs predict that this great collection can reach you soon in the fine shops around you.
The very large-sized hat will come with a Heel with a La Bomba design, a two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind the best-in-class hat was a cult label that looked gorgeous, with the second creation catwalk posted on social media â showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Bernt Orange Raffia bag was trimmed with Raffia Fringing and was fitted with a white leather handle, making it the best highlight of Jacquimus' La Rivera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMALE: "I hope big hats and beach bags will arrive in stores soon for the coming summer season - because designers have been so impressed by this that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: It is important for citizens of outside countries to have language skills
Scotland's private schools keep track of the best education records, and have continued to deliver the best test results since 2018, strengthening personal and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community efforts.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are associated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), under whose leadership these schools are trying to serve their students and parents the best.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of outside countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement a school curriculum, we see that schools continue to choose modern languages as a choice for a well-known and desired subject.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language that makes sense to him, you become the best for him.
If you talk to him in his own language, then it feels very good to his heart.
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can trust English more.
In the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages with the highest pass rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68 per cent of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 member schools of SCIS can be seen in 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in Mandarin language, while 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in German language, 69 percent of students received the French language and 63 percent of students received the Spanish language grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are cooperating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now included in the curriculum of private schools as an optional subject and other things just like STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills showed that employers struggled a lot to hire employees in vacant positions, with 17% of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have as many language skills as possible to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world because of the greater potential employment opportunities that language needs.
Regardless of which career option to choose, if people have learned another language, they will definitely benefit from such skills in the future.
If you are able to talk directly to foreign people, being a multilingual person will make you automatically ahead of the competition.
In 2013, more than 4,000 UK adults participated in the YouGov survey, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak enough in a foreign language, and French was the only subject that 15 percent could speak, and it was the only language to reach double-digit percentages.
That is why it has become necessary to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially languages of developing economies, will enable children to get better opportunities to find the right job.
The languages taught in every school in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a 2020 outlook and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of whether your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and also get staff who teach it to them who are experts in this field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to giving children a learning environment that will prepare them for the future and give them the skills they need for success, so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out right now that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages must be truly accepted as "international communication skills."
The option of choosing this option, diversity and excellence will continue to be given by private schools to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday in San Diego, LeBron began as part of Lakers
Now the wait for LeBron James fans is about to end as they are set to play their first match for the Los Angeles Lakers very soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the preseason opener to play against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, it is yet to be decided how many minutes they will play.
They will play at least one minute and at least 48 minutes," Lakers said via the official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six game preseason schedules of Lakers.
At this stage of my career, I don't need to be prepared for the preseason game.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held a series of rallies for the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Next week, Trump has set five more rallies that include Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other friendly venues.
With the Supreme Court staying the vote set in its election for the vacant post, Trump aims to seek help for the upcoming mid-term election as Republicans are at risk of being out of control at the time of counting votes in November.
When will Trump's rally in West Virginia be held tonight and how will you be able to see it online?
The timing of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia has been fixed at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is likely to deliver a Trump speech on this week's hearing, with the confirmation of the expected Senate vote for a week during the FIT investigation due to allegations of sexual offences against Kavanaugh.
But, the main goal of this stressful rallying horde is to assist the Republicans to face the elections in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump thus said during the campaign, "The goal of the five rallies next week is to energize volunteers and supporters as part of a Republican effort to protect and increase their stalled majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
According to Reuters, the spokesperson who has been removed from Trump's campaign said, "Congress's control has become so essential to his agenda that the president will visit only those states where our campaign season will be very busy."
According to West Virginia Metro News, the focus of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania can be brought to Pittsburgh media from tonight's rally, set in Wesbanko Arena of Wheeling.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, receiving more than 40 percent of his vote from the area in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, who is trailing in the West Virginia Republican Senate poll.
According to Reuters, Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "If the president is trying to give Morris a lead in the election, it is not a good sign for him."
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete so as to keep the hopes of being at the top in Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will see the result of what is going to happen in this rider cup.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but it cannot be predicted in competitions like when the player will go ahead and which one to trust.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
They had a six-point lead, which is now four, so I think we have to increase our momentum a little bit," Jordan Spieth said in a walk through the day.
Europe, of course, gained and went past four points with 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, the American feels they have little chance left and a lot to encourage, not only from Spieth's form but also from Justin Thomas' form, who played together throughout the day and both gained three out of four points from their game.
Spieth is deadly for everyone from tea to green and is also the best in the game.
As his game progressed, people cheered and cheered, when he and Thomas went down two more points after two, put the key to completing four all-squares.
Because of his put, his team came to the 15th position with the same scrimmage, sort that tells you that you don't consider the American team out of it.
You really just have to play well and keep in mind that victory is yours.
That's what all the players say who are out of the game.
18 holes to create a mark.
In the last two days, there are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, named Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, making a new history in the Ryder Cup.
Europe's different-style but better couple gained four points out of four and are at the forefront.
On Saturday afternoon, "Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot any bogie, but they stayed away from bogie until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning before 9 a.m.
On Sunday, he found the way to get runs and that runs in this dominant crowd and from this dominant crowd as if they were beat players, and there was no player who could turn the European team's possible victory into a defeat.
It is good that both of them are on different holes in different ways.
However, European dignity has long been talked about.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at that time his pairing was made with Alex Noren.
A bogie in front of the nine-dogs and Spaniard and Swede holed in two doubles, before they had never reached this point.
However, there was no person on Sunday who would help you reach your hole.
Fourball and Foursome were great on seeing that the interaction between pairings was great, they advised that they didn't need to seek advice and that they were well aware of how to change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead in the last day, but this four-season session also showed that the team USA has the ability to take on what is doubtful, especially in the Stateside.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of this on the last day of the Ryder Cup after a 10-6 lead against the United States on Saturday.
The best pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over Tiger Woods, struggling with two wins so that they could far outshine their Milan Le Golf National's four points.
To avenge his defeat of the trophy two years ago in Hazeltine, Thomas dominated the European Side Morning Foreball in Bejourn due to the misfiring of the American Side, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. won two matches and showed more resistance in the four-season, but they could not avoid losing.
The side of Jim Furyck needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single match to maintain the trophy's win.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari started with "Moliwood" after the sensational weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their opening four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in Foreball, they again beat the best player Woods and American stalled Bryson DeShabu by 5 and 4 points, performing better than ever before to lose.
Woods, who led himself through two matches on Saturday, has now lost 19 times in his 29 matches of Foreball and Foursome and seven of Rowe.
In the rest of the morning foreball, Justin Rose returned to Foursome with his partner Henrique Stenson and beat world number one and three player Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeca 2-1.
However, pleasent in the South West of Paris, Breeze Day had no break in Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the U.S. by gaining two points on Saturday.
He had a 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in Foreball and sent back Pauls and Rory McLaroy 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has happened only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team gained four points and came back from a single match, although the kind of furry side needed to get everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, Sunday's counter-attack after remaining second-best for two days is going to be the case, as apart from their old game.
North Korea says disarmament by saying there is no way will be only one side that cannot be trusted
The North Korean foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations had continued sanctions that depended on its mistrust in the United States and showed no way the country would stop inspecting the nuclear bomb only on its own in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Body's Annual General Assembly last year that North Korea had tried a number of ways that were associated with "significant goodwill", such as, stopping nuclear bombs and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear-bombed test site, and promising not to advance the task of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any response from the US.
Without trusting the U.S. in any way, there will be no trust in our national security and in such situations there is no way we can initiate unilateral disarmament.
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament that would gradually benefit North Korea in a gradual manner, his statement made it perfectly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left to one side only because Pyongyang has done so before.
At the first-ever summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Rei referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at which time Kim pledged to work towards the "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the call to end strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. has first stressed disarmament and raised the level of sanctions pressure so that it can forcefully achieve its objective, and at the same time, it has also objected to the "announcement of the end of the war," Ri said.
Restriction can tilt us, such an assumption is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that with the continuous ban, our confidence is diminishing even further.
Ri did not discuss plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, he said, adding that the U.S. leader spoke of the UN's strengths last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and further stated: "If the party is South Korea for this disarmament problem and the U.S. is not, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula will not join such a deadlock."
Nevertheless, Ri's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said of the U.N. National Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rocket after Trump called "Mr Evil President" on a suicide mission was inevitable.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, had praised Kim's courage to take up disarmament but said there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions will remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no deadlines for it, "if it takes two years, three years, or even five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps to be taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The Security Council sanctions should remain in force until without any failure we realize that we are completely, last and verified disarmament."
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea with full consent in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri at the U.N. General Assembly and then told that he would go to Pyongyang again for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his previous visit has not been great.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said the work had progressed, within just a few hours North Korea condemned them for "gangster-like demands."
At the Moon meeting this month, North Korea pledged to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts a "consistent measure", it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He said Kim had promised him a "consistent measure", seeking a guarantee of security that Trump would make a resolution in Singapore and that he headed towards building a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are doing courses for a job that is comfortable enough
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to find maximum comfort while competing in the growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
The teacher who teaches the world's number one university students often has no choice when it comes to exactly what to do to relax themselves.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of less sleep at the time of teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
She told The Telegraph, 'I got a girl at the end of the year and she said: 'Why do I say this every time I have to go to the next class next year?'
He said no one told him about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
For the first time this year, students will learn about how a good sleeping habit is important in academics and athletic performance, besides improving their general health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's Health Services, said students do not sleep enough every week for which the university decided to start this course.
A series of interactive tasks are included in the hours-long course.
In a section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to explain what will be the impact on caffeine and light and what kind of impact sleep deprivation will have on athletic performance, as well as, the importance of sleeping time in a routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that a lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zesler said, "We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But, we believe that they should be aware of this - just as smoking cigarettes are known to have an impact on health.
He said the culture of experiencing pride in 'waking up all night' still exists, modern technology and increasing pressure on students means they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring whether you sleep well or not is like a 'secret weapon' of students can counter stress, tiredness and anxiety, he said - it also protects against the impact on weight as lack of sleep keeps their brain always thinking about hunger which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jesler build the course, completing his last-year class at Harvard last year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be considered necessary for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining the competitive institute.
Prof. Jesler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before going to sleep, as well as deciding when they need to wake up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put a lot of circadians on them, causing sleep problems.
Livingston scored 1 - 0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Gerard
Due to Dolly Menga's strike, the Rangers faced trouble in another match, the responsibility for Livingston's 1-0 win was put on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ibro Side was looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in a match played in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team instigated Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager to oust Landbrox Premiership leader Hearts with eight points.
Before half-time, Menga struck for seven minutes and after that Rangers' line-up short did not get a chance to equalize the game even once.
However, the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind Hiberian because of the goal difference.
In addition, games can be even more trouble for Rangers since Linesman Callum Spence's head wound has been treated since the object was clearly thrown at the other end.
Eight changes to Gerard's side gave the previous Ireland a chance to advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point of Hearts last week and the way they drilled well, the opposition team suffered at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played much better than him.
When Menga sent Scott Peetman to Alan McGregor's goal by late-off for the first time, he should have given just two minutes, but the midfielder cashed in on this big chance he found.
Keegan Jacobs, who was in Deep, went free-kick to Captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lythgow, who was on the back post, could only stab wide.
The Rangers regained control, but in the final third they were more confident in their game than they expected.
Alfredo Morelos certainly experienced that he should have put a penalty on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless clashed with each other, but referee Steven Thomson denied the Colombian appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but former iBrow goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with Lasana Colibali's header and strike of Twi Ovi Azariya.
Although Livy's openers could have gone against the run-off game in the 34th minute, no one can deny that he alone deserves this graft.
Even after this, the best player in Rangers Deep could not beat Jacob.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept Menga calm to pick up for a simple finish.
When Gerard swapped Collibel for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect as soon as Winger slotted in Morelos, he took a break, but Kelly blocked his line while making a fine run.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the same kind of game they could really enjoy, he sweeps the long ball with lithgow and lighter after the long ball.
Holt's side could have increased his lead in the final stage, but McGregor prevented Jacobs from studying well before Lithgov widened from the corner.
The Rangers called Glenn Middleton, who was present as an alternative, made another late claim to the penalty as they were entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not let them succeed again.
Elmanac: inventor of Geyser Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and later... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity Geyser invented a device which was later known as Geyser Counter.
Geyser Counter is a mainstay of science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, as well as, in 1950 a film on it "Bells of Coronado" was made, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acting for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "It is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones you can certainly hear the effects of hidden atoms because of radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely popping up right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at that time he was about to turn 63.
However, his name is still alive because of his invention.
New cancer vaccine may cause poor immune system cells to be 'seen'
The new cancer vaccine can cause poor cells of the immune system to be 'seen' and eliminated
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient can be removed and replaced in the laboratory.
After that, the common protein for many cancers can be 'seen' and then replanted
In a trial for the vaccine, promising results are being seen in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was vaccinated, which showed her impaired cells in the immune system, then it was seen that her ovarian cancer had been eradicated for more than 18 months.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory can be removed and replaced, so that they can "see" the common proteins found in many cancers called HER2, and then replant the cells.
J Berzofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that this vaccine is very promising."
Prof. Berzofsky said that HER2 causes "a variety of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
Removing patients' immune cells and "instructing" them to detect cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a kind of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't work out
After Kanye West's best performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said that his government will be formed in 2020, during Saturday's night live, she condemned in the studio.
After the performance of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he was wearing the Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
So, I talk to the Gore people many times and they say: "What is the reason you like Trump, are they racist?"
However, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's skit, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating the sexual harassment claims made to him by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not revealed whether Rock was attempting to make West laugh with the posting due to the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that she was threatened with going backstage with her headwear.
They threatened me with backstage.
You don't go there wearing that hat," he said.
They threatened me!
He also said I am stuck in the wrong place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: "You want to see that wrong place?" At the same time, he said they would "make plays for my Superman cape, because it means you can't tell me what to do. You wish to move the world forward?"
Love me."
In his comments he mentioned the audience at least twice and SNL artists felt embarrassed, in a separate report one person told the publication: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was called in due to the delay in the arrival of singer Ariana Grande, a few days ago Ariana Grande's old boyfried rapper Mac Miller died.
West surprised many viewers by performing on the song I Love it, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West again met Candace Turner, head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous people: thank you for raising voice for the public."
But, Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted that West is just right there "what she told and what's completely amazing."
But, I didn't choose anyone who took advantage (by buying my music or clothes or supporting my "art") who, according to me, was promoting the wrong idea for my community or calling my community wrong.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, as well as that he was just "formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but before that did Didi and Puffie, whose old name was Puff Didi and P Diddi, respectively.
Rapper with him, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Lion and music's late famous Prince also changed his name to symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington questions toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Middle Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that watching such roles on screen often motivates many young boys and he feels it is important to do such a difficult job to get respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt explained that he was feeling 'something wrong' and asked how to eliminate the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married his co-star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who believes he feels 'quite firm' in talking about the problem.
Personally, I feel very strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity?
Are we teaching men that when they are growing up, they will have to deal with the problems they see on screen?
Kit feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he thanked its very much male principal character.
He added: 'What happens and what is taught?
From what is taught on TV and on the street, young boys begin to believe that they should do certain things in order to be a man?
I think it has really become one of the big questions of our times - how can we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the ideas of young men.'
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series comes again at the end of next summer, he would not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well, adding that he has done a number of programs with 'wargrounds and horse riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard's new series of True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is his meeting with his wife Rose.
I got my spouse through this show, so I believe that this show has given me the family of my future and my life has gone from here.
Rose has played the role of Yagriet, the girlfriend of John Snow, the Kite character in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In view of the recent changes, most of the new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to an infected blood infection.
At a conference in Yunnan province, China's health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV was nearly zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex carried out by China's LGBT community is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is reported to have a lot of discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
Because of the many infections of the disease, these relationships have insufficient protection against sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, promising everyone that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her employees leaked the data of the GOP senator, calling it a 'dangerous lie' and a 'how to plot'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters described the allegations made on Saturday as unfortunate, saying one of her employees had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Lawmaker's Wikipedia pages.
Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were being investigated by the "ultra-right wing" pundit and website.
Waters tweeted, "Thou lies, lies and so much more disgusting."
Reportedly, the information included South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch's home addresses and phone numbers.
This information was seen online on Thursday, which Capitol Hill was posted by an unknown person, when a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court-designated person Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
Kavanaugh was being questioned by three senators over the leak of some information.
Hill says the address of the IP address from a conservative site like Gateway Pundit and RedState that identifies the source of the person posting it was reported that the source was linked to the Waters office and that the information was issued by an employee of Waters.
This allegation is completely baseless, false and absolutely false," Waters said.
Any of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is baseless, completely false and absolutely false.
Soon, Waters posted online to clean up criticism, including a former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "The reason for this rejection is anger."
This shows that their nature is not the same as that of a member of the Congress.
When an accusation is made to someone, they should not be angry and do so.
They should not be rebellious.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should be calm and patient.
It seemed that Judge Kavanaugh was comparing Fletcher Waters' response to the Democrats' condemnation, with Kavanaugh being accused by critics of being in a lot of anger during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro had also tweeted his views on Twitter to defeat Waters in the mid-term election.
If this is true, it is a big deal.
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted proper authorities and law enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
We will make sure that the perpetrators will be told or not, and whether or not they will be held legally liable for all their actions that are too bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees," he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's Spying Acting Isn't Considered Too Strong
From the British perspective, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still traditionally seen and appears to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spoof franchise, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 under the name Johnny English Reborn.
Will we self-scribe on the subject of how we certainly consider it nonsense to talk about the nation's new export opportunity?
The unqualified Johnny English with a pop approach and a rubber face at any rate has a license to re-create the rest of the stuff - something that's much more famous than anything else than just his name - is a comprehensive comic creation for areas where English-speaking people live.
He is certainly the Daft Secret agent who managed to show Mr Bean's Dash Kluso a little bit despite his bizarre pretense in smoothie glamour and is a dope for the chap that contributed a single note to the charity of Fire Theme Tune at the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
They are originally travelers and are the International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for Wake's Chaos.
Only one or two good scenes are seen in this new JE outing.
I loved Johnny English, which showed me going to a helicopter wearing armored medieval suits and wrapping the rotor blade on my helmet.
Performing physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but laughter came down a lot and seemed oddly half-hearted, especially with the "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible presenting themselves as a component of the comedy with full confidence.
Laughter comes as if comedy was not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me, and Bean I've liked more in Atkinson's silent-film.
It is always relevant right now that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The most secretive network of UK detectives has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, with the identification of all UK working agents on this network that could affect the agent's work - this is a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and very upset Prime Minister, he is already struggling with many political and unpopular problems: Emma Thompson can play this Quasi-Teressa-May character well, but the script is not too strong to work on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy has been compromised, he has to bring someone who has retired.
In this way it means that Johnny English has to fight himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but how an undercover operative should be is to work apart from the record: it has some good comic stories, as well as, teaching English at a rock-type academy school by detectives.
The English have been sent back to the Emergency Whitehall for the briefing and Ben Miller's re-play has been mixed with his much-anticipated gecko-pained sidewalk.
Now that Boff is married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is that of Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Pepperdine has not been able to solidify.
So, in his Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin find some very big mistakes when they face Olga Cruelenko's beautiful Femme cracked Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of being exposed to the carimatic tech billionaire who claims he has a solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta played Jake Lacey.
English and bogs begin their Odyssey of Fercial High-Zincs: Fire a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and English fully activates chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use Volta's home interior.
The film is definitely drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but it is still fine and entertaining, the whole film has a lot of fun for children.
Well done middle class.
In addition, as I saw in other Johnny English films, in this film, I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really suits his talent.
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the people of the UK, but will receive money in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a democratic plan in which UK residents will have to work just four days a week - but money will be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's owners to give workers part of the savings through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that they can get an extra day's leave.
This will give the employee a three-day leave a week - but they will still be able to get the same salary.
Sources say that such an idea will be 'good' with the economic agenda of the party and it is a plan to benefit the workers of the country.
Trades Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift a week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party employee from The Sunday Times said: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take a four-day working week, which is perfectly in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of workers," he said.
With the Green Party pledging a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, at present this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: 'The four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get back power from 'faceless directors' and 'profits' in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire stake back as the Labour government can 'cut down' on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in the company's boards and create an inclusive ownership fund to hand over 10 percent equity of private sector firms to employees who can get annual dividends of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if Cavan's investigation by the FBI can change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Cavanna delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the question arises whether the bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was a possibility of the FBI finding something that would inspire them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more candid than his South Carolina colleague.
I think, of course," Kennedy said.
I said going to the hearing I spoke to Judge Cavan.
After this happened, when the charge came out, I called them, asking, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, determined, clear."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be a stone's throw.
I had made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and that would require an explosive charge," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whatever he named, he couldn't verify it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert with many extremely influential stars performing, and equally impressive is its mission; ending the world's poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawns of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only attract tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also raise awareness of the true goal of the program to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival, an international advocacy group, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket for the event (except when you are not ready to pay VIP tickets), those going to the concert will have to complete the "actions" in a number of ways, such as emailing a world leader, making phone calls, or other meaningful ways to help create awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free concert the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is just another case of the so-called "clickivism" - making people feel like they are truly making a difference by signing a petition online or by sending tweets?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing efforts for various goals.
These actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, it says.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion are already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have had a direct impact on around 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include the participation of investors and implementers based in The Power of Nutrition, a U.K., who is committed to "helping children grow to their full potential" by promising Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national government, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote of history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail."
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Genel Monai are some of the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furnace and Hugh Jackman.
US may use Navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
According to the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in the U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern part of Europe, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, so as to ensure that their energy does not go into the market," he said.
Zinke, a nonprofit group, was addressing attendees of the event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, calling himself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with a economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "economic options, more or less, in the case of Iran and Russia, are fuel leverage and replacement."
The statements are coming that the Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the "unfair" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin Moscow's "captive".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance was opposed by Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said, "When a big state interferes with our energy supply, I have a big problem.
Massachusetts Senator says Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" the presidential race after the mid-term election.
During the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
It's time for women to go to Washington and connect our broken government and that includes being a woman in the top position," he said, according to The Hill.
After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting the presidential election."
Warren, while assessing President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
I am completely worried from within what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy after all," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court candidates have been vocal in their criticism of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need to have a FBI investigation before voting."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents do not think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, eighty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said Senators should not contest elections.
Thirty-two percent supported the fight in this way.
The survey showed more support in terms of fighting elections by former governor Deval Patrick, where 38 per cent supported possible participation in the election race and 48 per cent were against it.
Other high profile Democratic names likely to contest by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said they would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night
I sympathize with other families who feel the impact of PTSD and know the wounds with which our soldiers come back," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which is what my own son is feeling after coming back.
Palin called his arrest an "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "they return with little change, they come back hardened, they come back thinking whether this honor is for him that his fellow soldiers and aircraft-drivers, and every other member of the army have sacrificed for the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Vasila police department, he was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and a woman was charged with domestic violence and possession of a weapon drunk.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a new U.S. policy legal challenge that denies asylum to victims of gang escape or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her violent gang's member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her request to grant asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, creating a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed unorganised immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be judged on the basis of particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such obstruction violates that principle," said the amicus curiae.
The attorney further argued in the abstract that the policy denying entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and mass violence in June.
In its June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "A shelter is available for those who leave their country due to persecution or fear due to their caste, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group."
Asylum was never meant to reduce all problems â even all serious problems â whose people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts in Palu due to double the death toll in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was extremely serious.
It sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, consoled a child suffering from fever in the exit center of the city of Tahas-Nahas Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings the bodies.
Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their desolate homes, picking up submerged items, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital sank in a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who were facing a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated in the open outside due to frequent strong earthquake tremors.
In his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter, tears filled his eyes as he felt the tremors of a violent earthquake.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as told her family was in the city for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' through 'promotional ads'
A week after running a four-page ad, referring to the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, by the state-run Chinese newspaper in an American daily, China's U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the U.S. press.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after China accused China of trying to interfere in the Congress elections on November 6 - referred to China Daily's paid supplement in Iowa's highest-selling newspaper - the Des Moines Register, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, US officials told Reuters that Washington was a new phase in the campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in a growing trade war that has seen them round the clock to impose customs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory customs in the trade war were previously designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and a long-time former governor of Iowa, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses, the leading exporter of agricultural goods to China.
Branstad expressed his opinion in Sunday's Des Moines register, writing that China is now doubling that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own independent press.
In its promotion, by giving paid ads to the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished tradition of the U.S. regarding freedom of speech and independent journalism," Branstad wrote.
Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the roadside newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and no right reflection of the inconspicuous opinions that Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic curve line," he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided making excuses for publishing his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are segregating women voters ahead of mid-term elections with the defeat of Cavanna, analysts warn
Since the top Republicans facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment are supporting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, the analyst has warned that they will see a response, especially from women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
The sentiments around it are quite fierce, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to go ahead with the vote.
Those things can't be returned to," Grant Reehr, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that pressure by Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) for FBI investigations at the last minute would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, said, "Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither tomorrow nor in November."
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with Cavanna's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters in the Senate hallway shouted slogans "November is coming!", Mick reported.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to withdraw from the charts."
People are saying it's already raging; it's true.
But it could be more, especially between female voters from the suburbs and young voters aged 18-to-29, who don't often vote when the president doesn't like them."
While detailing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had already said that there is a possibility of opposition if Republicans proceed with confirmation.
It has become a confusing mess for GOP," Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News.
It's not just about the committee vote or final vote or benching Cavanna, it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated them," Guy Cecil, director of the election-helping institution Priority's USA, pointed out to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in what to believe in in view of the testimony of Ford and Cavana, most of which seem to favor Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony definitively or potentially, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanna definitively or potentially.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Cavanah had probably or certainly lied during her testimony, while just 30 percent said so about Ford.
After pressure from Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least another rival, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford took the oath last week to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanna assaulted him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while studying at Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new internet compared to Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of Technology Legend, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which information will be allowed to access.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can make available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team were "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to start the entire transformation, where all their business models will end overnight."
We are not asking for permission from them.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard von: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric Celebrated
The Church of England's only pastor who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated 100 years in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard von won the award in the September 29, 1918 attack on Bellanglais and Lehocourt.
However, they were killed four days later by a sniper and they never knew that they had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his ships at a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "fantasticly symbolic" that the statue was being unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Von led his battalion in Canal de Saint-Quentin "amidst a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
Later they headed towards the firing line and, with "great heroism", led the military-line before taking the field-gun alone and dashed three troops.
On October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended, a German sniper was killed.
The 72-year-old Michael Vaughan said his grandfather's exploits were "some that I know can never be equated with, but that we are proud of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vaughan, also laid wreaths after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughan said he was "feeling very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said that "the heroism of a real hero is being demonstrated by the support being given by many people."
MMA fans kept awake all night to see the Belter 206, but instead they got the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch the packed Bellater 206, but were deprived of watching the main event.
San Jose had 13 matches in the bill, including six on the main card and showing live all night on the UK Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gagard Moussi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the U.K. were stunned by the coverage turning into Peppa Pig.
Especially after waking up in the morning for the bout, some were extremely disappointed.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the broadcast, Belator's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, "This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children's programming."
Peppa the Pig, yes."
Belter Company President Scott Coker said they are going to work on their scheduling to include the UK audience in the future.
I think when I think about replays, I think we'll probably find a solution," Coker said.
But there will then be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, a lot of text was moving when this change happened and they were not all compatible.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We'll limit it to five matches instead of six - just as we normally do - and when we tried to deliver something more for fans, it was a little too much.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Daily felt 'inferior' in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he has become obsessed with inferiority complex for everyone because of his sexuality â but it has inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he reached secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first radio 4 Desert Island disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said she talks about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
She also said she cared less about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
Cursti Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has taken several months off due to the illness.
On Lavern's appearance as a society-feet man at the first event, Deli said she felt "a decrease" in herself than everyone else because "like boys and girls wasn't socially acceptable."
She said: "Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me strength and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he is also "special," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when he finally came to know about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt fortunate to be able to live freely without any trouble and wanted to give "hope" to others.
A three-time world champion said a man -- American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black -- met her in 2013 -- when she fell in love with him -- "I was surprised."
Deli married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so many experiences at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone with similar experiences at such a young age.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daly said his "whole outlook" had changed.
If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
Deli said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that the last time he wanted to know was whether he had received the London 2012 tickets - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell them that you wouldn't stay to sit in the front row, Dad."
He said, "I held their hand when they could not breathe and held on until their breath had stopped and they were dead, so I went and believed they were not invincible."
The following year Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
All I knew was that this is what I dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the crowds of the country at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - the Proud by Heather Small - which resonated with him during the preparation for the Olympics and which he still stands out on hearing.
Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to save it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Playing for the 12th time in a biennial event for the record, Mickelson was dropped from the game by captain Jim Furyck for Saturday's Foreballs and Foursome.
Instead of becoming a hotspot, as he has often remained for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among cheerleaders and working in the hope of improving the weaknesses of his way of playing.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old player has never been the ideal fit for the Tight Le Golf National Course, where those who have not been active for a long time are regularly punished for wrong shots.
And while the course isn't that simple, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played together with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the U.S. players, who start with four points down in 12 singles matches, start strongly, then Michaelson's match can prove to be very important.
Fury expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say anything else.
They fully understood their role, patted my back and surrounded me in my arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think of him playing two matches.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way we thought and the way we thought we had to move on.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This rider can mark the end of the cup career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furrick said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
He's funny, he's satirical, he's witty, the answer is, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas BjÃ¶rn knows the big lead may soon disappear
Thomas BjÃ¶rn, European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large lead in the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into uncomfortable moves.
Dane made his first appearance in a 1997 match at Valderama, where a side under the captaincy of Sew Ballestiros had taken a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a victory of 141â2-131â2, with the lowest margin, just reached the finishing line.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we had lost, and in Valderama, we had just been able to win," BjÃ¶rn said, thinking in mind, after seeing the class of 2018 from Friday 5-3 and the 10-6 lead in Le Golf National yesterday.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it's not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus is to be maintained.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players around the world - stand on the other side."
BjÃ¶rn further explained how his players performed on the tough golf course: "In this I will never be able to overtake myself.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Personal performances will come forward tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you get out there in person, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players to showcase your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and give his best."
Unlike BjÃ¶rn, the opposite standing Jim Furyck would have been wanting a better performance for his players personally than he did as a partner, the exceptions were Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who had scored three out of four.
Before Europe faced defeat because of the "miracles in Medina" tax, being part of the winning team at Brooklyn, Furik himself has been at both ends of those big last days' turnarounds."
I remember every aspect of him," he said in response to a question on how Captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
We have 12 important matches yesterday, but you'll want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We set our line-up up to our own and included people like that, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the counter attack with Rory McLeiro in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the top half of the other European order.
I had grouped them in this order because I think it covers everyone," Bjorn said of his solo selections.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The German Navy's new warships should have been commissioned to replace the period-influenced Cold War-era warships in 2014, but due to faulty systems and rapidly increasing costs, it won't happen until at least next year, local media reported.
Commissioning of the "Reinland-Puffelz", the flagship ship of the all-new Baden-Wurtemberg-class warships, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, a military spokesman was quoted as saying by the Die Zeit newspaper.
The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg class ships were ordered back by the Navy in 2007 to be brought back as replacements for the period-affected Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will facilitate an array of powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth techniques such as low radar, infrared and acoustic division.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that state-of-the-art warships - which could allow Germany to have a power project abroad - will become timeless until the period of entry into service, Die Zien commented.
The formidable F125 warship had made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned the Blohm and Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people were aware of the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant as Baden-Wurtemberg-class ships would be driven by a crew of some 120 sailors - only half of the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Puffelz" is considered to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the entire project's price tag - including crew training - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached â¬3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from the initial â¬2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings is gripping Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, the head of the German Parliament's defense committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the Navy was actually "deploying-enabled ships".
The issue has become serious over time as the old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were provided, the official said.
He said none of the Baden-Wurtemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is secretly listening to the secret life of bats
The new research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use natural landscapes in their hunting for food.
It is expected that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique mammals flying and will help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland, will follow the usual and soprano pipestrales as well as brown long-eared and doubenton bats nestled in the Inverway Garden of Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at major locations around the estate to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of bat calls and what species are doing.
Then a detailed landscape-scale depiction of their behavior will be prepared for the natural-vasa map and report.
Rob Dever, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural habitat management functions such as the construction of grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly in the last century
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect the bases of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also become a threat.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a victim due to their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly survey, inspect the bases of birds and sometimes save them.
The organization has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threeve Estates of Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is a great place for him.
Here in Threeve we have a great area for bats," he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that's still unknown, so the work we do here and in other estates will help us understand what they need to grow."
They emphasize the importance of checking bats before they are maintained within the estates as it is possible that inadvertently 400 females and infants could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity facility, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, persecute or disturb or destroy their bases.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
He said: "We still have a lot to know about our bats and we still don't know how many of our species are growing their population."
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while lawyers sued German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has named rape claims against him as "false news", saying people want to "publicize themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is about to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus Forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Dere Spiegel said in the report on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after reporting claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as "false news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular by my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm a happy person and all is well," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for charges he has called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the field of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said players would seek compensation for "moral damage to the amount in line with the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite of Palms Hotels and Casinos in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and also photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement as she felt "fearful of retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to terminate the agreement as her harassment has been going on since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and struck a â¬100 million deal with Italian veteran Juve this summer.
Brexit: UK will 'regret forever' to lose carmaker
Trade Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "regret forever" if it loses its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnstone, near Derby.
We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said border delays could have an impact on jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Bernstone plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
I believe if the UK exits the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnstone.
Other UK carmakers have expressed apprehension about leaving the EU without consent on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, which includes parts of made-to-order cars every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the European Union.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border, according to industry that may lead to delays and shortages of spares.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated to avoid those checks at the purely border."
We need a deal. We want a great deal that, in my view, can not only be enjoyed in the present, but which is also necessary to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Not only has there been evidence from Toyota but other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue with it which has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Sowelleris, who has worked at Burnstone for 24 years and is the Convener of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are highly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back after in Bad.
We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union," an official spokesperson said.
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House on Sunday said Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for "another week later" as the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanna's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election intervention, the relationship between the Trump assistant and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will remove the Deputy Attorney General, and that puts Mueller's freedom in jeopardy, the news has warmed Washington's rumors market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of putting the wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday they went to the White House amid reports that they were about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "like" Rosenstein's removal but then delayed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Cavanna, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date has not been set for it, it may be this week, I can see that the eye can be pushed another week ahead in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to the TV reporters' reluctance to "gorgeous", although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they're gorgeous."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president does more Q&A sessions than any other president," she said, not citing evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The briefing will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try a lot to do this and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the president of the United States he's going to replace the press talk."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated his unbridled and sometimes unique presence to journalists present, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The health secretary has written to EU employees working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government is already committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens working in its degraded public services.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "In the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, moving to the expected decisions this autumn.
But the U.K. government is also pushing its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it must have been a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how much I value their contributions, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
Co-workers from the EU, and beyond, bring with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Ebercromby, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organ said.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before Hofftime.
He came to the shore and just fell there," Reid said.
The trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Eberdrombie has come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "no details are available on the type/limit of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is Redshirt Sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after relocating from Illinois.
Before exiting the game, he made a total of five tackles on Saturday, taking his season to a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers while buying property in the UK
When foreign buyers buy property in the UK, they will be charged high stamp duty, which will be used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Enhanced stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
Treasury expects it to raise up to Â£120 million a year to help homeless
Preparations are being made to recover high stamp duty rates on purchase of property in the UK from foreign buyers - the additional cash that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign attracting young voters with a pledge to provide more affordable housing and target higher earners.
Stamp duty hikes will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with additional funds that will boost the government's drive to deal with goldmakers in adverse circumstances.
Overload - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two homes and rental purchases launched two years ago, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to Â£120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of newly-built London properties are purchased by non-UK residents, making it difficult for first-time buyers to lay their feet on the housing ladder.
Many of the wealthiest regions of the country â especially in the capital â have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of raising property prices by grabbing land but not using them, and urged Mrs. May to leave quotas at affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing waste".
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive range of proposed housing reforms, including fare control and the end of a "no-fault" controversy.
They want to give more powers to councils for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our disparate housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is not correct that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as well as foreign-based companies to buy a house for hard-working British residents.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become a far cry, and the fury of gold under odd conditions is extremely real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently third in the league one, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsround.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father since childhood, and it has always been something that brings me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as a manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Eloa athletic boss says he felt no panic following established names in such a big club that had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, the success for me can be gauged from whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Due to the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful here if I can get the club there."
Having spent 15 months in the coaching staff of Hearts and as an assistant boss of Dumbarton, Ross's management career has been just three years.
He then helped Eloa recover from the decline of the third tier, and replaced St. Mirren from the brink of the decline of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Heartpool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academics.
In the case of Aloa taking over, he said, "It was probably the real intersection."
I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It sounds bizarre because I did the right thing, earned a fair amount of money from it, and enjoyed some reasonably highs.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing this, it makes me feel most comfortable throughout my adult life."

The summer tapas has promoted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the statistics, said: "July means that compared to the constant sunshine and the expected participation in England's World Cup, similar patterns followed in the month of last June, when pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that restaurants faced even more difficulties.
Restaurant trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June and worsened in July.
Wine-selling pubs and bars performed the strongest with more choice than restaurants.
Food-driven pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
For the month, the sales of all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent, while food prices declined by three per cent," he said.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events makes it the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although sales would be painful, with a 4.8 percent drop year-on-year, especially due to current cost pressure.
The long summer weather could not have been a bad time for food operators and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide much-needed relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slow pace in brand roll-out.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analyzing data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of Â£9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey shows that one in five children â some younger than 11 â have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers
20,000 secondary school students survey revealed an increase in "fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children â some young people under 11 â are creating social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clear "main" account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager in her was urging others to "rape me."
Research from independent schools by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistress' Conference (HMC) found that two profiles of 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds were accepted for holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's very disturbing that a lot of teens are tempted to make a place online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who have guided the sport to benefit from their extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Ileed has great respect for the Scottish, UK and the world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit a lot because of bringing them on board," Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I'm looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
In addition to its four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and who are now regular BBC pundits became unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I felt a trauma.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell whether I will be fine or not and to what extent I can be fine.
It was a grueling task, but learned to fully recover, walk again and practice agility today!
Thank you for the encouragement messages!"
Comparison of mothers' cows by breast pump advertising created differences in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company divided opinions online by an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired ad, with the new pump giving mothers the freedom to express.
In the grassy barn of cows, four real mothers dance to a song that includes some of these types of lyrics: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't thuns, these are my tits."
The chorus continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies."
Whatever it is, advertising, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has led to online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from the audience, with many saying it lightly highlights the "horrority" of the dairy industry.
It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
They need to give birth as soon as we get pregnant and produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly within the nursing bra (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: "Of course painful for both mother and baby."
But yes, why not use them for advertising breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?"
Someone else added: "What an irrelevant ad."
Others defended the ad, one of which the woman said she found the ad's song "ridiculous".
I think that's a great idea.
I would also have had this, if I were still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel absolutely like a cow.
This ad is a bit weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a great product."
The second commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like a "cow."
It is not advertising promoting or decisively promoting the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they continued to dance by pumping carefully into their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women pumping breast say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvy pump is well hidden, has no wire or tube and fits directly into a nursing bra, allowing women the freedom to roam, catch their children and even go out without pumping.
Anna Ballerin, partner and mother in the ECD commented: "Elvy Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a steamy and spectacular launch.
By drawing parallels between them, telling about women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time the Elvy pump has been in the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children who used the product appeared to be catwalking for designer Marta Jacubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children sneaked into a tent camp on the Texas border
The captured migrant children were spied on, even when there is no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to some extent because the rigorous zigzag and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hire children with sponsors.
Traditionally, maximum sponsors themselves had hired migrants without documentation and were afraid of risking their own ability to live in the country by claiming any child by going ahead.
The threat increased even more in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adult or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, a senior official from Matthew Albence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor the accompanying minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested already have no criminal record.
About 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's home live illegally in the country and the maximum of them are criminals.
That's why we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Albans said.
Seeking to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear before the court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the asylum-taking staff.
Many people appear through video conference calls instead of being personally present to present their case for legal status to an immigrant judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for release are immediately fired.
The longer children remain in captivity, the more likely they are to remain restless or depressed, which may be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts according to conservation staff and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said that those cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said that taking children to the tent town without giving them enough time to be emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends will increase the shock he is already struggling with.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish forces to return immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the country was now the eighth year of the war.
Moulam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly."
They should go back from the warground immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moulam stressed that the "war in Syria is almost over" where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and many millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this "supernatural war until we clear all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and the "appearance of a foreigner."
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, primarily training and advising both Khurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the country destroyed by the war.
On the case of refugees, Moulam said the conditions were fine for his return and attributed the "some Western countries" to "spreading fear of waste", which prompted refugees to stay away.
We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this return," he said.
They were politicizing an entirely human case.
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive any aid to rebuild until there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United States politician says that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the stronghold of Idlib's last major uprising creates an opportunity to further pressure political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
However, Moulam said the agreement contained a "clear timeline" and hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including warriors from al-Qaeda linked to the Nusra front, who would be "eroded."
United States Representative Stafan Di Mistura hopes to soon hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the path to the election.
Moulam placed certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, stating that the task of the panel should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and to warn against interference.
Why Trump Wins in Second Term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are expecting any blame and scandal to end his term ahead of time.
It will undoubtedly be the most dramatic closing of the national post so far!"
So far, there was no exhaustion in the audience.
Since 2014, the prime-time rating on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and at MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of over 1.7 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, and MSNBC's "The Racial Maddo Show" found the highest place by gaining 3.5 million viewers in cable ratings with major news airing at night.
An ABC drama about the Cabinet Secretary "Designed Survivor" that becomes president after being destroyed at the US Parliament House in an attack, its director Neil Bayer said that "it's a fire that people are getting attracted to because it's not something we don't understand."
Nail Schowell, an experienced comedy writer and producer of "Just the Funny Parts: and Hollywood Boys" has a different theory of some of the harsh truths hidden in the club.
She recalls a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
She said, "Because he makes me laugh," Ms. Schowell told me.
In disarray was the value of entertainment.
Beyond all that, on TV and things, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Ro V. Wade, the oneness of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only the privileged audience could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen, when you find yourself looking at a six-hour debate of a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward's "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar bomber jacket ("a rough cloth with a Habaris" said the Washington Post) and the implication of the description of Mr. Trump's Anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I will never see Super Mario that way anymore.
As part of everything he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night," said Brent Montgomery, creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars," which is about Trump's show's rotating cast and Rose's plot twist (selecting any fights, praise of Kim Jong-un) from N.F.L.
You can't afford to skip a single episode or you'll be left behind.
When I went to meet Mr. Flees this week, the northern edge of Kauai had a warm 80 degree temperature outside his house, but he was watching MSNBC recording CNN inside the house.

I remember when we were doing all that silly or agitated show in those days and people said "this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flass told me.
I thought it was some kind of a joke, but later found out they were right.

In the run up to the election house, there was a flood of outside money in a strong Madhya Pradesh.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, thanks to the re-building of the Congress Legislature, which led to two office bearers running for the same seat.
Which recently opened the front for the suburban Pittsburgh district's democrat Rep. Conner Lamb - who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second-post race, Republican Cat Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, intermingling with the new 17th.
Following this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional forgery in favour of Republicans by older districts, maps or maps were reconstructed.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed fight between major finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) touched the economy of the campaign.
Lamb's name became widely popular in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That is why the seat was occupied by the Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump won that district by 20 points.
The political pundits provoked the democrats a little more.
US punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then retreats
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing because of resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a vigorous meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization's management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Haider Nort said in a statement that state department officials decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan now".
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 including narcotics control, development, and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made at internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, similar to last year, which was seen as a step forward as an attempt to prevent immigrants from the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference in a sign of importing administrative locations to the conference, which has now been scheduled in mid-October.
And the three Americans quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesperson for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of anonymity.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who are close to the administration and at the same time talk on the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on Mr Trump's potential resistance to justice, of which there is now enough evidence in public records.
At the same time, Mr. Mueller changes the direction of his investigation according to the report that if Mr. Trump's campaign colludes with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body when he prepares himself to go in front of voters again and perhaps before a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot if or if and I do not mean to indicate or suggest that the collapse of Mr. Trump and his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed from the West and Czechoslovakia supported him in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the massacre of so many years.
The functioning of historical focal points around such divisive points and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divide points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump expels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who controls Mr. Mueller's final outcome of the investigation?
Rosentine has been in this confusion ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting he secretly keep the president's record and consider his disqualification for office.
Mr Rosentine said The Times account is not accurate.
If recently requested Brett Kavanaugh's F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite the proven allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?
And above all, will we vote for the Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I think we won't fail because of the lessons I've learned in Preg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who first occupied my ambassador home as well.
She lived and settled down in the US and after 60 years she sent me to burn sabbath candles on a swastika buni table.

Graham Doran's Rangers are optimistic even after the intense Vienna encounter
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after the impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, conquering the Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
The knee injury prevents the midfielder Graham round from appearing for the first time in a season up to 2-2 par with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
It was a good thing for us because the villas were good," the 31-year-old said.
We went ahead in the game with the belief that we can get something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving towards Thursday, it's a second big European night.
Hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult game as they get good results with our back crowd or mass in their previous game, I am sure we can play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and the changes made to the club itself last year was definitely difficult but now this place has a good experience.

Women are losing their sleep for fear of this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it to their family members.
More than half of individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won't be able to prepare your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as that option can be important factors in determining the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you suggestions on how to pay those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-priced life insurance policy, to help pay these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have money.
Introduce your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so you hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, professionals follow your wishes.
Also, consider the attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medicines and allergies?
Tell that information in a written plan, so that you are prepared.
It doesn't just have a financial role, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
What medicines are given?
Who will take care of the dog?
Is there a plan?"
A man fired in the air several times in LaFracob
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he was on his way home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of LaFracob, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers describe the shooting of BST as a "casual event" at around 02:30 pm.
The victim could not see his attacker.
His wounds were not so deep, so the police appealed to him to be a witness.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's city on Friday killed at least 384 people and the death toll is expected to increase further, officials said.
When communication was stopped, the rescue officers were unable to get any information from the Dongla Regency, the northern region of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated trapped in the devastation.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the banks of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami knocked, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongla is a regency on the beach northwest of Sulawesi Island, extending over an area of over 300 kilometres (180 miles).
The Regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, which was 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongla.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morovli on the opposite coasts of the maximum Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, the tsunami has hit Palu and Dongla several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people lost their lives and hundreds of homes were destroyed due to tsunami in Dongla.
In 1996, a tsunami hit Western Dongala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and regularly faces earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's AK province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of whom were in AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also hit the west coast of Sumatra in early March and April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A tsunami of magnitude 6.8 struck Indonesia's most populous island, Java, activating a tsunami that struck the coast of the south and killed about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 near the city of Padang affected the region, which is the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the region on the island of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra, causing dozens of villages to be ravaged and nearly 300 people killed in an area of up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake in AK strikes the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as it reminded people of the destruction or devastation of the 2004 terrible earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people died due to building or buildings collapse.
2018: Intense earthquakes on Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok devastated everything, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded for a while.
Sarah Palin's elder son arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, the eldest son of former Alaska ruler and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Pelin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pelin, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on Saturday for allegedly domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released by the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance used to try to call the police to report an alleged crime, he used to take a call from her.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Maut-sou Pretrial facility and was also fined for $500 of unsecured bonds.
The network report said he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself not guilty when asked for a plea.
Pelin faced three A-class criminals, where he could be fined up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a one-day sentence in jail and a fine of $2,000 under Section B of the Indian Penal Code.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted for attacking his father Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of experienced individuals in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstructing the report of domestic violence and possessing a weapon drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he punched her on the face.
After linking his son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016.
Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's island in Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
With the death rate rising in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake struck central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of Indonesia capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact on social media were circulating.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered for the beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for NYC attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding a rare death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect of the terror attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment to be awarded in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, reportedly uses a home depot hired truck to attack a bike on its way down the western-direction highway in Manhattan, cutting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Cypov has "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" injured them physically, according to the notice of the intention to demand the death penalty imposed in New York's southern district.
These two countries potentially impose death penalty according to court documents.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury struck Cypov with an ultimatum for 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for aiding racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors in particular in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said the attack required "enough planning and prior deliberation", explaining the manner in which Cypov carried it out in a "detestable, cruel and wicked" manner.
Saifulou Habibulavic Cypov injured and harmed the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleavus Enlour DeCat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allergy, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Elozandro Pagunco," the notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The trial in the last death sentence case in the South District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Khalid Brain was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were last sentenced to death in the New York federal case in 1953, a married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Jones Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Cypov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, did not have any glans or regrets for days and months after the invasion according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked everything he did.
Cypov told officials he was inspired to attack after watching videos of ISIS meeting crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
She pleaded not guilty to the 22-calculation offence herself.
David Patton is one of the federal public patrons representing Cypov, who says he is "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
We think our decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Cypov's defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be made the incumbent for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz vowed to 'collect an army of people' during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Ukip leader asked politicians to 'understand' the atmosphere - because Theresa May's own MP suggested she should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that if Mr. Faraz was Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'excluded by now'.
But the challenges faced by Mrs. May in resolving her extremely divided ranks have been underlined by Pro-Riemen Tory to add a distinct protest against Brexit in the city.
The Premiere is struggling to keep on track the compromise plan of the Brexiter, the Remners and his checker during the attacks from the European Union.
The colleagues urged that she would try to make a deal with Brussels instead of Backlash - and force Euroscaptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said leaving means leaving the rally in Solihal, in which he wants to 'throw away the checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should become a partner and should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we would have been out by now," she said.
Wellingboro MP or MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to pull out checkers.'
Setting its opposition to the EU, he said: 'We don't have to be under anyone to fight any world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their views and they want to live is a complete lie.'
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkins also said in March: 'I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it as it is not so prevalent between our party and our workers who actually gherao the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening."
In a focused message to Mrs. In, she said: The Prime Minister maintains their jobs when they don't break their promise.
Mr. Faraz said that the leaders of the rally should be made aware of the 'ambience' if they cheat on the decision taken in the 2016 Referendum.
This is now a matter between our people and our political classes.
They're trying to cheat Brexit and today we're here to tell them that 'we won't let you run away.'
Sending a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to form our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit by understanding the atmosphere.
We are organizing the army of the people of this country that has brought us a victory in Brexit and who does not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Reamers march from Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the heart of the city.
A gang of activists pointed to Tories against the Brexit banner after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour Peer pretends to have a conversation about the security problems caused by the party app when Lord Adonis Conference opens.
It is these people who tell us that they can have the proper IT system for Canada, the resistance limit and the free trade in Ireland, and all the technology.
It's a complete mess.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to adopt a 'strict view' on the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a strict watch on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the Town Hall in Western Massachusetts, Massachusetts democrats or Democrats talked about their future.
Warren GOP, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for re-election in state-renowned Geof DeHail No., who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were speculated that they could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to join the presidential race.
Warren replied that it is now time for "women to go and fix our broken government and in which women are included first."
LSU arrested in Sim's death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rog, LA, announced that a suspect was arrested in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
Betton Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET News Conference or Conference.
He released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
The 20-year-old SIM was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
Police chief Murphy G. Paul told Per 247 Sport on Saturday that "he died due to a bullet on Wade Sim's head."
Wade proceeded to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
When asked by Simpson, he admitted to killing Wade Sim with a weapon there.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained by the police department of Eastern Betton Disease Parish.
A 6 by 6 foot junior, who grew up in Betton disease, played 32 games with 10 start in the previous season in the SIM and rebounded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team's win over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas is eligible to play a big role in the "Louis Hamilton Mercedes" team order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and drove Hamilton out as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vettel to create hurdles in the drivers of his team.
Vettel first went to Pitts and left Hamilton in the back traffic of the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was behind a lap and came out from behind Vettel but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari's driver reluctantly leave free after a double-move while defending at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a larger portion of the race when he focused on changing his tires and quickly surpassed the km Raccoon in fourth place.
He finally came to Pitts on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, when Reconan finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really nice gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by getting one or two, Hamilton said.
It really was a very bad gesture.
President Donald Trump lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request on Saturday, not leaking Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
While speaking at a rally in Western Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current situation in the Senate, saying that people are "meaningful and bad and dishonest."
A very good thing or thing that could happen over the past few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people, he said.
When you look at the releases and leaks and then they say, "Hey, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak...no, we didn't leak, he said pointing to the senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter of the details of the allegations made by Ford against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in early September â but Feinstein declined that it was leaked from the office.
I didn't hide Doctor Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she said.
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "I tell you that it was really a very bad gesture."
He may not have done that, but I have rarely seen such bad gestures before."
Continuing the defence of the Supreme Court candidate, the three women accused of sexual misconduct, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
They are determined to withdraw power through any necessary means.
You see their meanness, dirt, and at the same time they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the mediator reported to the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars won a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday to compensate for the loss of Friday's Elite League against the Belfast Giant.
The Giant initially got a two-goal lead through the attacks from Patrick Dyer and Francis Buewellier.
Before the Giant's lead Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowny Dior took home the side level before re-establishing.
Before Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen secured the win by two goals, Francois Boshard equalled it for Dundee.
It was Adam Keefe's third Elite defeat of the season for the man who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giant winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
Dwyer's opening candle came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with McFall's assistance, with David Rutherford helping Buewellier double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the busy opening period, Sullivan performed his home game back at 13:10 before Matt Marquadrate came equal to the Connie at 15:16.
Dwyer makes sure that the Giant takes the lead in the first break until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The domestic side is grouped again and Boschard once again brings them to the level period with power play goals at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the second period of the match and ensured victory in his team's fifth halfway in the final period.
Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now scheduled to play in their next match on Friday at their home ground Milton Kane.
The air traffic controller was killed in ensuring that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is greeted as a hero or hero since he died in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can land safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The subsequent trauma in the area continued to destroy and many people were trapped under the debris in the city of Palu.
But when his colleagues were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Egang refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport in a precariously controlled state.
He stood there to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was about to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtrate, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them even before the helicopter's pals arrived.
Our hearts were broken by their departure," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands with the destruction of the country, with the agency saying access to Dongla, Sigi and Botosh is limited.
Mortality rates may still rise as many bodies may still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places that cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho.
Up to six meters of high waves destroyed the palu, which led to the mass burial on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance used to bring the bodies.
Getting clean water is rare.
Small markets were looted everywhere."
The head of the International Red Cross, Jain Galfand, told CNN: "Indonesia is running the race to help the Red Cross survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there."
It's already a tragedy, but it can be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo reached Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia had earlier this year experienced an earthquake in the Lobok, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niegini now tells that a man has been missing since the Lagoon plane crash
The airline operating the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia now says that a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew were evacuated safely from the sinking plane.
Air Niyugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to a request for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the island airport, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all of them is now stable.
The cause of the crash and how the incident happened is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say the two planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or witnesses thought that the aircraft did not land on the runway.
American traveller Bill Jane said the plane had come down too much.
Jane said, "It's a very good thing."
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water from the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the aircraft's staff was nervous and yelling and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said the sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue by using an airborne boat to bring people to shore in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the aviation safety network indicate that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline in the past two decades but no one was involved in the air evacuation.
The analyst reported the time of the night when the woman was burnt alive
The prosecution on Saturday restored its case to prosecute a man again for burning alive a Mississippi woman in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she had used cell phone records to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Muzzim Quintan Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location data from several cellphones, which shows that she was accompanied by Talis Chambers on the evening of the death, refuting her previous claims, The Clarion-Lazer reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michel Sanford, his cellphone was with the Chambers at that time, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and submitted his statement and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Talis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after the death of the chamber, Tallis has removed all text or message, call or contact information from his phone from the chamber.
Helle said, "He wiped him out of his life."
The defendants are ready to start their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury for hearing that day.

The second black person?!
NY Nanny Sues Couple After Firing After "Racist" Text
A New York nanny sued a couple for partisan flirting after a mother complained that she was a "second black person".
Couples reject that they are resistors, suing for "absorption."
Linsey Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, found out that the new baby caregiver Giselle expresses her discomfort to Morris, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
No other black person" Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband it sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing Nanny, who was African-American, has done a bad job and she is expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber by paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a $350 per day compensation on the couple's job and for six months, in a live-in gig he was appointed to start work without any contract though.
Look I want to show them that you don't do any such thing," she said in a post on Friday, stating that "I know it's discrimination.
The couple said on claims that they are racist, stating that they cannot trust him after insulting him, it was fair to end Morris' employment.
My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He is not racist.
We are not racist people," husband Joe Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Leave it too."
Like the trial of "absorption," Plasco said his wife has only had two months of childbearing and is in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going after someone like that?
It is not right to do this," said the investment banker.
While the legal trial is still going on, his behavior and reasoning have given him a quick response to accusing the couple on social media.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not associate it with their own ideas and opinions, the new letter suggests.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkins, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of someone as having their own place when reading it for the first time before it is published.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Explaining about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about his work being rejected, saying that there were both "happiness and gum" in the 60th anniversary of his book's publication after his death.
About Paddington, which she describes as a "significant member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
He was a quiet man and not arrogant at all," she said.
But because Pandington was very real to them, it was almost like you have a child who finds something: you are proud of them, even if in reality you are not doing it.
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his imagination and creation, he always credited Paddington for it."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pastor 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was useless.
Nade was regularly saying that it was really bad, not expecting such a thing from her," said Mrs. Aden-Laparus.
Then Nad called me and told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine given by the doctors to beat his heart was gradually ending, leaving his system.
She would have died some time ago and it would have all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn't do anything to scream, scream or cry, because I was surrounded by my family people.
I had to take care of everyone."
Finally Mrs. Aden-Laparus, who was sad to lose her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers who were unaware of what situation she was going through.
No one knows," he said.
I lowered my head and there were tears flowing all the time.
It was difficult to express, but I got to see a feeling of extreme sympathy for Nad in the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards for women suffering from suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide want to stop others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Cali Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the bridge to Welsh with inspirational messages that people can call for help on.
Mr. Davis's son was 13 when he was suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Leidney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could light up everywhere."
Although he had left work before he died and he lived in a "very dark room."
In 2014, Tyler's brother who discovered his lost brother or sister at the age of 11 at the time, after which he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect."
Ms Davis wrote, "To tell people that there are people out there who you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her friend Mark of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or upset or anything else," she said.
A few days before Christmas we will make some changes in her behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he couldn't see them."
She said her death was a big shock to her, but she got out of it: "It ripped the family from the inside out."
It made us sad.
But we all had to go ahead and fight."

At the start of the FBI investigation, Kavanaugh's future was in limbo
I thought, if I could really find something he is looking for - a limited time and a limited scope of investigation - maybe we could bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday and at the same time that he fears that the committee is "breaking down" amid the alleged partisan gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance was due to time.
The mid-term elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 â as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so what they wanted to win in the high court on land will severely undermine their efforts.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the Senator, promoting him to support Mr. Kuwanagua, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The Senate will vote, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sitting.
It is not clear if Mr. Kuwanagua could receive at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, vice president, had to confirm by abolishing it and in the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives 'fall' by Kim
North Korea's number of fugitives went to South Korea decreased seven years ago when John-un came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's Ministry of Integration, Park Bayong-Siog said 1,127 people have run away from their duty last year as compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and occupiers were the main factors.
Pyongyang made no public comments.
A large number of fugitives from the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Maximum China fled, with the longest border with North Korea and it is easy to cross the reliably protected uninhabited zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by forcing them.
The relationship between the north and the south - which is still technically in a state of war - has seen an improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocked nuclearification talks.
It became active in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim John-un in Singapore, when they widely agreed to the terms of working toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yang-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress ever since.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no way but to unilaterally harm ourselves first," Mr Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "fun", saying she is not qualified for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brat Kavanaugh a "fun" and said he is by nature unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't think that a woman can even perform such a performance, they call it "fun," Pelosi said Thursday, responding to Kavanaugh's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavangu emotionally denied the allegations that he had ever sexually abused Doctor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, talking about his family and his school years, sometimes yelling and stopping breath.
He clearly punished the Democrats on the committee by the liberals who were angry over Hillary Clinton's losing the 2016 presidential election, falsifying the allegations of a "bizarre and coordinated character secret".
Pelosi said she feels that Kavanaugh's witnesses have proved that he can't work in the Supreme Court, as it shows that he is acting against the Democrats.
I think he disqualified himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi raised doubts that if Kavanaugh becomes permanent when asked and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives, would she still blame Kavanaugh.
I would say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fair to the Supreme Court, but being invited he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanagua is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rules against the Affordable Care of Act or Rowe Weid, as she is known for doing conservative justice.
In the trial of his certification, Kavanaugh avoided questions about if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
At the hearing of his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions he had come up with if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court rulings.
And women need to shake it up.
It is a religious convulsion, the anger of months and years comes out and she cannot stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me after 45 years that "when we cry, we get angry."
I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "A woman who works as an officer somewhere, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, "Maybe you think I'm sad because I'm crying."
I'm angry."
And then she spoke.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job, a male head office, is when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, finding that an old woman was holding my neck from the back - a sharp manager from whom I was always a little scared - who dragged me into the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone."
They don't know how fierce you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them."
Patricia Schroeder, female president of a Democratic Congress from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat or boat named Monkey Business, making a relationship with someone other than marriage, and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was highly disappointed, himself decided to participate in the presidential race.
It wasn't a thought-provoking decision," she said, laughing at me after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to collect funds and so she vowed not to participate in the race until she collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 would give him only $250.
Do they think I got a discount?" she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch any formal campaign, she could not overcome the emotions - thanks to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it difficult for her to collect funds and anger at disappointment and sexism from targeted voters, rather than representatives - she suffocated.
You might have thought I would have nervous breakdowns" Ms Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to her.
You might have thought that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samadhi?
She was crying.
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was going to slow down and while the war is far from over, the rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was made earlier this year by imposing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase this week, with new tariffs affecting items worth up to $200 billion (150 billion pounds), is effectively taxed more than half of all goods from China to the US.
Beijing has taken revenge every time in its own way, with five to 10 percent of the most recent US goods slapping tariffs of $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US shot-to-shot and the world's second-largest economy is likely to flicker soon.
Getting Washington back means hollowing out demands, but bowing head to the U.S. in public would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Still, experts say Beijing could do its best, with the U.S. trade war positively supporting China over the long-term while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that either trigger economic tailspins in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what was previously seen by the audience," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for new US security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary withdrawal of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven-year-long war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, External Affairs Minister Walid al-Maulam said the situation in the country is improving.
The situation on the land is more stable and safe due to the progress made today against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for voluntary return of refugees in the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Maulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.

Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team by a final score gate of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Journe's Teen reaches 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe regains its title again.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the 3rd 16th hole across accepting the match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all her rounds by becoming 1 out of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbzon Oleson, the lowest ranked player in the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lan Polter, who probably played his last rider cup.
An experienced of eight rider cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a tough year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team., and I'm so happy that I was able to help," said Gracia emotionally after Europe's victory.
He torched his fellow John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
I feel extraordinary proud to beat Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rehm.
Wood lost all his four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career rider cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 main titles second only to Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finyu, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with America's PGA and Ryder Cup Committee and proceed with Thosom.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
You should greet them.
We played better."
