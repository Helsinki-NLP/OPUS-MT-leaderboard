Black box in your car?
While U.S. street planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on your car’s dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motor-driver and transmits that information to the authorities, has become an issue of a controversial effort for the Washington and State Planning Office to revamp the outdated system to finance America’s major roads.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of sudden intense debates and vibrant alliances.
You’ve got the details of the miles you’ve drived, and possibly the drive location – and then use this information to generate tax bills – along with librarian environmental groups to gather support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
Tea Party Bunch.
The U.S. Civil Libertarian Association is also very concerned, raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether or not to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how in the next decade they can go into a system in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor-drivers have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which have GPS monitoring.
It is really indispensable item for our country.
It is not a matter of being elected or elected by us” says Hassan Ikhrata who is the executive director of the South California Government Association, planning to start tracking every mile decided by motorists in California by the year 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
technology to do this.
The main reason for this to happen is that the country’s highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is funded by U.S. citizens by paying taxes on gas pumps.
American people no longer buy as much gas as before.
Now the car in a gallon gas runs more miles than before.
Federal tax did not increase in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high value of gas, politicians refrain from increasing even a penny in tax.
Gas tax is not at all sustainable,” says Li Munich, transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Their state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
In the long term it will serve as the most logical option,” he says.
Wonks calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to urban liberals, as this can, for example, change taxes to change the way a car is driving, which can help reduce jamming and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are eager for this system while they are developing strategies to accomplish the goal set in the ambitious global warming laws of the state.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favor of the driver paying per mile.
Adrian Moore, vice-president of the policy in the region, said, "It's not just doing what's going into the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are receiving.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries, who in their report in 2011 graciously urged Congress to move towards pay per-mile.
The U.S. Senate had approved a $90-million test project last year, with 10,000 cars involved.
But while working on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representative of individuals who had to walk a lot of miles daily to go to work or to go to town, the leadership of the House ended that resolution there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most inclined Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mileage fee instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
The city of New York is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is trying out with trucks on a limited basis.
And I-95 alliances, including the 17 State Transport Departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not get support in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary drivers a short time ago, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Concerns about the Big Brother and other similar things were the major problem,” says Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something people wanted.
As the test progressed, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device.”
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology framework, which must be spread out in order to keep a record of every person’s daily commute.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get a description of how many miles the car is running daily, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers were to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing enjoyed by highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at fixed time intervals.
If you don’t track people’s pace and their location, they will be more willing to adopt this method,” said Ryan Morrison, Chief Executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programs of the state.
There are also very few expensive and less interfering ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give drivers.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or one can choose not to take any device again, but to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience than less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will also have the facility to pay the parking meter fee, provide "payment according to their drive" insurance, and build a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motor-drivers will be able to use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document mentions, “Motorists will be attracted to participation due to the benefits they receive from it.”
However, some transport planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion on payments according to miles is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that congress can deal with the bankrupt highway trust fund problem very easily by increasing gas tax.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars can also be charged an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay their fair share.
When work can be done with Aspirin, what is the need for a radical surgery," said Randy Rentseller, director of the commission's legislation and public affairs.
If we do this then crores of car drivers will be concerned for their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died from drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police on charges of hiding the belongings of the deceased with him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation in the court.
On August 26, the police had recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in Jhelum Dariya.
His family members accused his friends of killing him because his mobile and other belongings were missing.
In the report, the police said that the deceased’s phone and SIM were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman said in interrogation that the phone was given to her by one of her relatives, Ruhail Gauhar.
Ruhail also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of late Zahid.
Ruhail went to bathe in Jhelum with Zahid after Namaz-e-Jumma on August 25.
Zahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the edge, while Ruhail walked to the other side to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhail looked for Zahid, but he could not.
On this, he picked up his mobile phone, clock and other accessories and kept them for his use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died due to drowning and was also confirmed in the post-mortem.
However, Ruhail has been taken into custody under Section 404 to hide facts and belongings of the deceased.

Former Italy Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is famous for the Bunga-Bunga parties, has been extremely intelligently married to a 28-year-old girl.
This is revealed by their family friend, Marthe Polanco.
According to him, three-time Prime Minister Berlusconi has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
This is Francisca, whose relationship was being told that his relationship with Balrusconi was merely a show.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga Girl Marthe Polanco have revealed that they were also invited to this intelligence marriage.
This ceremony took place three weeks ago.
When Polanco was asked what would happen if both of them got married, Polanco has said that they are both already married.
It was not a public function.
This marriage took place in the private chapel located in the house of the former Prime Minister.
No one else can tell anything else.
However, she did not go to this marriage.
He has sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
Both of them married about three weeks ago i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a woman 50 years younger than her was engaged to Francesca Pascal.
Berlusconi laid the ground for loneliness behind this decision to escape Kirkiri.
Rain continued intermittently between the eye of the sun and Micholi even in the lower areas.
Along with this, Sheetalhar has started in the entire plaintiff.
The cold can be gauged from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached 4.8 °C, in Gulmarg below zero -0.2 °C and in Leh -1.8 °C.
Leh was the coldest in the whole kingdom.
At the same time, due to rain and snow, strategically important Srinagar-Leh has closed for national highway traffic.
There has been heavy snow on the jozilla pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowflake of this season in the hilly terrain of Kashmir.
Due to the activation of western disturbances, the period of rain started in the high mountain areas of the plains on Thursday, which continued till late evening.
The normal life was also affected by the cold.
To avoid cold weather, people were immersed in houses.
Meanwhile, power supply was also stalled in many areas.
The maximum temperature of Srinagar day was recorded below four degrees above normal 13.7 degrees Celsius.
At the same time, in Jammu too, due to heavy wind rains in the early morning, the cold has increased during the night.
The minimum temperature recorded in Jammu is 16.6 °C and maximum is 27.0 °C.

On Friday, Asaram, locked up in jail for sexual harassment, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, they are being offered as children’s blood drinker Dracula, but the court rejected their demand for banning media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Satsivam refused to order the media to stop playing news about Asaram saying that he has seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to interfere with them.
How can we stop them when they are receiving notifications from police and other people.
Earlier, Asaram’s lawyer accused the media of showing exaggerated news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They file a case against Kiss, but the back was not affected by these arguments and refused to interfere in the case, saying they had more options.
Even before this, once there has been a demand for the possibility of banning court media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS evasion case ever.
The mall’s group operator paid the concerned financial institutions by deducting TDS, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
By doing so, the TDS rupee kept depositing with itself.
The group was joined by the Mumbai-based exploration team on October 17 with the Jaipur exploration team.
In the investigation of this link, it was found that this trader has deducted TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the team of TDS had started the action of income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days before the risk of account sealing, the raids and surveys were processed on the mall operator’s group.
Annoyed by this action, the businessman has clearly told the income tax department officials that they are not ready to pay TDS rupees to the income tax department right now.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and taking action.
In this case, the investigating authorities have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
In view of Deepawali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of lousy and fake mawa increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemically-rich sweets.
The department seized 70 thousand mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand spoons from Quetta Colony.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for lousy mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department got information about bringing the poor mava kept in dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Mave consignment is being floated from the transport garage.
The department took over this mawa, which was stated to be priced at Rs 70 thousand.
Fear of action did not give any right to the mawa.
The department took the unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department recovered about 5 thousand spoons by raiding Jitendra caterers based in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulphite was used to glow and stay for more days.
Its sample lab will be sent.
S.S. Deshmukh, the co-chair of the department, said that the campaign of chemical sweets and raunchy and fake mave will continue.
In the next few days, this campaign and speeding information has been given by the department.
Consuming these sweets can also lead to a bane.
The department asked sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from mawa.
People have been appealed by the department to beware of fake sweets and mawa.
A handful of 42 senior leaders of the state BJP received him vigorously at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come on a visit to Bihar for a consolation visit organized by the BJP.
The consolation journey is an exercise by the BJP to heal the kin of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that in Patna, there were a total of seven bangs one after the other during Narendra Modi’s Hunkar Rally on October 27.
The intention of Indian Mujahideen terrorists who were involved in the explosions was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people were casualties and there was an atmosphere of panic in the state.
That intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The leaders of the party have gone on a journey from Thursday to take a bone urn from their village.
On November 5, the bones of all of them will be flown together in the Ganges in Patna.
Consolation in the form of part of this journey is a journey.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
They will go to the village of people killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. on Saturday to meet their family members.
During this visit, they will also provide a cheque of five rupees to the kin of the deceased.
This economic help has already been announced by the BJP.
On Saturday, when the Indian team will land in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, they will be aiming to capture the series with a win.
After two consecutive ODIs were washed away due to rain, India had to win Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series and its batsmen won the record while performing in a bang, which made the team equal 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has achieved a target of more than 350 runs twice and once again it will be the responsibility of the team to cross the goal.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and the biggest target is also proving to be a dwarf in front of it.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have great hopes for the team.
As far as opening is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got the team in the form of an opening pair that is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he gave Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure while partnering brilliantly in the opening.
At number 3, Kohli is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar with the Virat performance he has done so far.
Instead, many cricket pundits have termed them even better than Sachin.
Virat, who is 25 years old next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won 16.
His average is above 80.00 while chasing the target and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India’s top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopped in the previous match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, for them, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline'.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
He is also demanding that he be taken to the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hyunge and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
The lack of Michelle Johnson in bowling can make Australia heavier.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home for Ashes series preparations.
BJP national executive member and chief spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy to infiltrate terrorists under the guise of this ostentatious peace.
Citing reports from intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is emphasizing the heel peak to infiltrate about 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this, he will never let there be peace on the border.
Pakistan has become even more distraught after the separatists failed to incite people in Kashmir to massively spoil the situation.
Last year, citing the Pakistani visit of separatists, BJP leader said ISI chief Lieutenant General Zaheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chief Hafeez Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism will be aired in 2014.
Pakistan is engaged in fulfilling this promise seriously.
Killing soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
In such a situation, while calling the demand to eliminate the privileges of the army in the state fatal, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-people to talk such things till there is permanent peace in the state.
This gives fuel to anti-national elements.
He stressed that the morale of the leaders’ army, security forces, should be stopped on the downswing statements.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperation" with Germany on the American watchdog
Edward Snow Dane, a US intelligence informer, has declared that the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities if they are ready to travel to Berlin to provide evidence to Parliament in German.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snow Dane on Thursday in Russia, where he has been given asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter submitted to the media in Berlin before Mr. Snow Dane on Friday: "Although the outcome of my efforts is positive, my government recognizes the disagreement as the party - change, and provides no defense that seeks to criminalise political speech with felony charges."
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said he believed that he could persuade the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against them supporting the international community.
Allegations filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include spies and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Internal Affairs Minister, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snow Dane has been ready to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel has had a phone bug.
Thomas Oparman, the Member of Parliament who is the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence information, saying that if Mr. Snow Dane as witness had the opportunity to listen "to the relationship with the U.S. completely wasted and without bringing them into danger," it should still be taken.
Shristra Belle, an MP from the Green Party of Germany, published a picture of herself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He was on his journey to Russia with two German journalists.
According to former NSA contractor lawyer, Snow Dane is not able to go back to Russia if he left Russia, Mr. Belle said.
If Snow Dane testified to in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snow Dane said in his letter that "he had to face a fierce and continuous campaign", he was forced to leave the house.
Although he is happy and overwhelmed by global wide-ranging responses" towards his work of political expression."
Including the United States - world citizens as well as high officials have judged the revelation of a irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when human condition problems have been solved."
Frontier Airlines to charge a carry-on baggage
In Frontier Airlines carry luggage for passengers on their plane board - plan to charge $100 on-store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although it was announced on Wednesday that passengers could keep the entire box.
New carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if the advance is paid, $100 will have to wait if the passenger pays until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Mali said that the $100 fees passengers have to be achieved to take care of the charge in advance.
We don't want to charge it," he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Stuffing those who are trying to avoid passenger charges as much as they can carry-on baggage in which the overhead compartment is stag, this means this compartment often has little space.
Fee is a way to bring less to passengers on board.
O'Mali said it's not really about raising new charge money.
Finding the place of overhead bin that it is for the most loyal customers about Frontier has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets in their airline website do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may give $100 to a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate, can get a bag free.
O'Mali said that the procedures of Frontier's website and check in are being changed to ensure passengers know about fees before getting to the gate.
The new frontier carry-on fee will not start until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often reveal dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but prefer airline them.
They argue that money is spent to handle baggage, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are many as an indication that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most though carry-on bags fees are not even touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started the carry-on fee three years ago for the first time, and the partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
There is a fee as well as a Wizz Air of other airline Hungarians, which airline consultant J. Sorensen said, and who tracks the add-on fees.
He estimates Spirit's carry-on fee of $50 million in a year, which was reported in December 2011.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into Spirit and surprised passengers who have suffered a carry-on unusual bag fee at the gate.
The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was intuitive," he said.
I hoped to gnaw teeth and watch out at a battle gate.
The plane was full and he climbed it lickety-split."
Frontier is also following the $2 fee of Spirit' for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier Nekah that the passenger who will take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and it will give free coffee for only once.
It will still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but after the passengers complained seven months later they retreated and followed any other main airline after being there.
If the passengers of Frontier's do not purchase directly from the airline, then this step by Frontier to charge charges on carry-on is their fresh effort to operate the customers towards their own website.
Airlines online travel seller pays Orbitz for such $10 to $25 each ticket sold.
That is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has gone ahead in this field.
Many frequent flight miles in September began to give halfway to customers who bought from an online travel agency from these individuals
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows them to choose their seat in advance for the sole passengers on buying it directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of clients in its home town in Denver, but its trade is becoming less and it is losing money.
Revenue decline by 9 per cent and its flight capacity has reduced by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic are trying to decide Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sales.
NSA accuses “internal error” instead of hackers for website crash
The enigmatic national security agency said on Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours due to some technical shortages, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
Tonight, the NSA.gov was not in reach for several hours, which was caused by an internal error during a pre-determined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved this evening.
The claim is not true that this hurdle came due to the distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible for some users.
The NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s internal, sensitive network was “not at all” compromised.
The spokesman said that no classified information is in danger.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting NSA’s website by a DDOS attack.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a high amount, until the site is closed due to the server overloading.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the aim of attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly enigmatic NSA, once named "no such agency", has become the subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the common people from the occurrence of a very large amount of foreign and domestic spy programs in the past months—which followed the evasion of secret NSA files from the agency by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who was group-disturbed and surreptited.
Due to such growing controversy about the agency, after the tonight incident, such speculations were made that this incident was the result of targeted cyber operations.
Beautiful expressions were presented in line with the 'Another Dronacharya' plot showing harmony in the Dwapara era and in today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today’s perspective, in which shackles, a master is obliged to walk on the wrong path.
The play was launched jointly by Chief Guest MLA Prabhudayal Valmiki, Vice President of Cantonment Board Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh at the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play depicted Dronacharya of the Dwapar era and currently a professor Arvinda’s symmetry of the circumstances.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod restless, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sammy, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc. made a spectacular presentation while doing complete justice to the characters.
In the play, the lighting system was designed by young colorist Jitendra C. Raj and set by Hemant Kumar.
After this, various awards were presented to the personalities who made literary, cultural contributions on behalf of Apta.
It was handed over to Dr Aslam Jamshedpuri, Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Rangkarmi Jitendra C. Raj, Urdu Head of Department of Urdu, Charan Singh Vivi.
Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc. contributed to the executive officials in making the event a success.
Bombardier's profits fall as aircraft delivery, orders fall
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its train unit in the third quarter and on contract issues less than that as pressured by plane orders and deliveries.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not offer an update on issues that would complete its ambitious program of releasing any flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or moving to commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test plane about one and half months ago, it has just been blown three times, raising questions whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell short of the forecast and the stock is sent to over 8 percent sliding in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with National Bank Financial had slashed its rating for "field performance" from "beat" on Thursday. The stock is up during the next one or two quarters is limited.
Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight test program.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, suspect that the market will be suspicious of the program.
Bombardier expects the aircraft family can now catapult it at the low end of the Boeing and Airbus dominated market.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flighted for the first time in September after months of delay.

Officials convinced the analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to the schedule.
The test plane was on land for a long time compared to the forecasted," Baudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was scheduled during the land test and software update plane intervals.
Every manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and to make an updated period and said what we have done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts believe that customers are skeptical in the first 12 months after their first flight a CSeries aircraft can start operating.
Bombardier has said that it will evaluate the Service in Admission (EIS) schedule and provide an update in the next few months.
This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our idea that the service in the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.

Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the following order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," said Baudoin.
Aerospace revenues drop by 13 per cent in $2 billion.
Bombardier said revenues in the division, the world's largest train manufacturer, had increased by about 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backloged at around $32.6 billion on September 30, above modest from December 31.

New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
No one comes to mind the thought of lying and stealing or cheating.
But our mind changes as soon as the evening happens and we start walking against the rule keeping the norm aside.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research from Harvard University and the David Acleus School of Business of Uto.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values while not having work stress in the morning, but due to fatigue or overpressure as soon as the evening arrives, honesty decreases.
Researchers did two experiments for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to point out whether the point was higher on the left or more on the right.
Participators were told that money would be given to them if they responded wrong rather than the correct answer.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the right answer.
At the same time, while experimenting on people between 12 and 6 pm, it was found that he deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping his laws on his gaze.
This enabled researchers to prove that the greed of money in the morning makes no difference to our honesty, but as soon as the evening comes, we stop paying attention to morality.
This research is published in the latest issue of psychological science.

Imprisonment to the addicted counsel of cocaine who has given secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
42-year-old Basharat Datta reported to the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
Advocates thought that people could find out about his confidential drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The top advocate of the rescue side, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid that people will know about his secret addiction to drugs, three years of imprisonment.
After compromising his cocaine addiction, the 42-year-old Barsat Detta provided sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities to the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
This advocate, nicknamed "Bash" and admired by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarborough having three cocaine bags at the lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a law society dinner with his co-workers.
After getting cocaine particles in Ditta’s hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta A was a “regular user” of drug category.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and its associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
It had 32 other persons who were sent to jail after the police seized more than 1.5 million pounds worth of heroin and cocaine, and over 200,000 pounds of cash, during several raids.
The 42-year-old Datta used to provide information to criminals, because he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Detta, employed in law firm Forbes Solicitors, today Liverpool was facing a dystopia in the Crown Court after being found guilty in two cases of obstructing the way of justice after a trial lasted for three weeks in Liverpool Crown Court.
He had accepted about keeping cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer started when while investigating Scarborough, the police found out that he had been in contact with Detta regularly on the phone since February 2011.
The two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming to Detta’s house and keeping more than 60 percent of the purity drug under the lawyer’s bin in Black Golf Glove.
After drug was kept, Scarborough was regularly in touch with Detta on the phone, who went out for dinner at Blackner Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer reached home, it came to know that there was drug and there was a nine-time dialogue between them.
The court heard that he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when a category of drug clues were found on Ditta's hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, but refused to use cocaine and said that she was talking to the suspected dealer because she was his client and said that his discussion was the subject of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove her wallet and remove a lot of credit cards, but she was seized, and her hair was sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients used to call his home for legal matters.
After the arrested chief persons told what the spies knew about them, the court hearing said that Ditta used to call the leading people in the drug supply chain, some of which she had previously submitted.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: “The criminal advocate must know best about not breaking the law.”
Mr. Datta is accused of abusing his post as criminal advocate, of associating too much with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the general drug dealer, but about a dealer who is providing the drug to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations would definitely have been legal without a doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his limit of lawyer-client relationship.
He disrupted police investigations as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but insulting him.
He made too many close-ups from certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement with his freedom.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I were a corrupt lawyer who was not I, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it right away.
But after hearing Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: “At the time when Mr. Detta started receiving drug from organized criminals, he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal advocate.”
His cocaine addiction led him to compromise too much and became too weak towards the objectives of the leading members of organized crime groups who used him to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and must put confidence and confidence in people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this faith and tried to escape from the guise of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit of Lancashire investigated Mr. Detta, in which he was also found guilty of three incidents of keeping cocaine and disrupting the way of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals into court.
This case should serve as a warning for criminals that no person is away from the reach of law.
We will find you and present you to the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine, and cannabis.
Thirty-five other members involved in the gang were sent to imprisonment for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
Detta on her website gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client with a death penalty in the US, Mohammed Ali’s being their dinner guest, and inequality being a motivation for their work.
Kenya’s press on disputed media law outraged
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying "This is a horrifying place, and it is valid to ask: what is there to prevent Parliament from taking away the judiciary's freedom in the coming tomorrow?"
Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the Capital Group – Kenya’s most reputable independent radio station and news website CapitalFM – said that “this law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it.”
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is a part of the government" and said that banning content and advertising will damage Kenya's location in the global economy.
I hope that the President will listen to us, and we appeal to them to reject this bill and send it back to the MP people," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide "strict control over the media" to the government, while The Standard said that democracy and freedom to speak in Kenya is "shocked" and this bill has been described as cruel.
This bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after being attacked by Islamic gunmen at Westgate Shopping Mall in September.
Kenya’s media had broadcast security camera footage of squads sent to the attacking space, showing them plundering the mall so purposefully, causing authorities to get angry with Kenya’s media.
Police chief David Kimyo had sent summons to two journalists and media persons for questioning, although this summons had been withdrawn after media misconducted.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan shillings and separate journalists on media companies can be fined up to one million Kenyan shillings and, in addition to that, the additional risk of not being "deleted from the list" or official press recognition will be different.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a penalty for shaking the foundations of most FM stations is enough."
It also said that these measures could lead to the devastating effects that are described as Kenya’s “vibrant blogosphere”.
By shutting the media mouth, politicians know that they can do their will.
Nation’s journalist Mutuma Matthew describes Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing “no one will ever know.”
When left to politicians, they would bankrupt the country and bring us back to the age of hunting and depositing," he wrote.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced people’s anger.
In May they voted in favour of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and about 532,000 shillings per month, restoring tax-free body pay, which is considered to be the world’s highest.

UN sets new goals to combat poverty
The United Nations is immediately starting to work on a new group of goals, replacing the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
In order to replace MDD ending in 2015, Australian diplomat played a key role just before the Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, in advancing the "sustainable development goals".
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Bain Ki-moon said at the night summit that it’s time to “get up above national interests”.
I am very pleased that member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process for setting up a universal sustainable development goal," he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be an overall part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do my best to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to fulfil our far-reaching objectives of sustainable development goals based on the success of MDG.
Mozambique's Safety Concerns Grow as Strong Figures Conflict
With a statue of the founding President of Mozambique, Samora, who stared down on them, gathered thousand people in central Maputo for the slogan of peace in a rare public demonstration.
We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, Chief Executive Officer of an investment company.
Intimidated about the future of his country, he changed his corporate dress from the printed T-shirt "We demand security" in a Portuguese and he joined the crowd of capital Freedom Square on Thursday.
The struggle between government troops and Ray Namo for two weeks has been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement initially supported by the apartheid government of white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa, after that as part of attempts to destabilise the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-fledged conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the rapidly growing economy of the northwest of huge offshore gas reserves and discovered coal reserves of Rio Tinto, some of the companies including the Well of Brazil, Eni can bring in investments of more than $50bn next year.
The ruling Frelimo party, major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the stress.
Ray Namo says the government on October 17 launched the latest conflict by launching an attack on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Ray Namo citadel,
The attack on former rebels and then onset up the government forces attacked the Renmo targets and Afonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Mazhang, told the Financial Times of trying to kill Ray Namo’s spokesman.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Jibuhan has sought to spare concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday, that Mr. Dhaka had seen himself as a "lost" "trying to prove to the armies that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid the war.
Mr. Majhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was revoked by Ray Namo but later became a matter of concern.
He told FT that it means that the agreement is not being awarded by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but seriously,” said Mr. Mazhangen.
The last talks between the two sides did not do anything special to ease the fueled tension of a series of conflicts this year.
It's about the two older men fighting together (Gifhan and Dhakama)," said Joseph Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them are good negotiators and neither of them are necessary to create types of concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for election reforms, had already said about the boycott of municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as a morbid movement attempt to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
The share of Ray Namo in voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo, was formed by member with the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) expected to improve its performance in elections.
Mr. Majhang Jibuzhanko says- who is leaving office next year at the end of his second term - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to leave the presidency because he does not want peace. Transparent election does not want," Mr. Majhang said.
They have not clarified what type of capacity is of Ray Namo, but it has made a major hit and run tour at police stations and vehicles on the North South Highway..
Most of the skirmishes are in Sofa La Province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, with host Beira Port relying on exporting miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley, to coal.
Rio suspended its experiment for nearly a week in June after the threat of attacking the Ray Namo line.
Ray Namo will be able to repeat this threat or not. Mr. Majhangvinit was almost questioned.
Ray Namo" things were not going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community, Mr. Mazhang said.
The government of instability further aggravated frustrations, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also worried about corruption, slow pace of development and recent floods of kidnapping.
People are the government and president to the people responsible for the country future, and think that he should be one to find solutions to problems," he says.
Omar Sultanate, an exhibitor, people still need durability.
No one cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends, as "models for a way of author of life".
Thor's stories could show"There is no match for all subtle tricks in brutal strength," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths also advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works to teach "exceptional far away even the wild" and in some cases even in porn and schools it would not be appropriate to be taught.
I find it amazing, in the US, myth and folklore are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I have been arguing this as a scheme for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more enlightening" and is a "new twist" for children, together with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo Saxon, wrote a penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales together, saying: “You may have a lot of intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.”
Possibly writing an adult for a offspringand writing an adult author requires some sense of great difference hope between an adult foreshadowing.
But it is a spontaneous sense of good and evil, because everything is simplified or come to a happy end.
And that should be submitted rather than stated through a story revealed.
Not showing the old base.

Ben Greenman: The New Yorker, the tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
People may argue that the city of New York is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago comedian Frank Fay, who served as the master of celebrations at the Palace Theater in Broadway, began to jot people sitting in the crowd directly in a way of conversation.
Fay’s discovery has expanded during the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, composed and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute called Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
Most of these headliners appeared in Carolines, and became a huge success, to the level where they became too big to be played at the club,” says Hirsh.
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes the presence of Wanda Sikes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maihar, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, “Stand Up for Heroes” which included Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and other artists including Bill Cosby.
Along with the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians who participated in this year’s celebration have come through non-traditional means, such as shows coming on small networks such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll reached the lead position from Deep-Cable Sitcom (F.X.'s exuberantly Ronchi Fantasy-Football themed "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marsle the Shell with Shoes on".
Other young comedians with different voices, including crawls and slates, are products from the decentralized world of American comedy (W. Kamau Bell, focused on satirical, ethnicity, and so on), with an absolutely different voice.
Among the most important highlights of the celebration will be an interview: David Steinberg speaking to Larry David:
Steinberg started working as a standup comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, she hosted the show "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the heart of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry’s works,” Steinberg said.
They were telling me that, when they were here, sometimes they would go to the street between two buildings and think of themselves that I would stay here if I lost all my money.
Oil continued to decline to $96 per barrel
A report showing concerns over more supplies such as Friday, the oil price continued to decline, where the power-hungry construction sector in China is growing stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was 14 cents down on $96.24 per barrel until late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the US Raw New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen 5.8 per cent down to the month of October, fell 39 cent on Thursday.
Sufficient supply of crude oil is weighed on the price in recent weeks.
U.S. supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week, the energy department said on Wednesday
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand has shown an increase in activity that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China’s economic recovery after being less committed in the last quarter of 7.8 per cent in a two-decade-third quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries.
Court has blocked action on New York Police Department’s break and sports policy
A Federal Appeal Court on Thursday blocked changes requiring a judge’s order for the New York Police Department’s break and sports program and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Courtappeal 2 & Judge Shira Shindelar has said that the judge's decisions will result in an appeal by the city to be pending results.
In Judge Nagar it ruled in August in violation of the Constitution by way of preventing people and out of its program of interrogation.
The city police department has appealed to its findings and its remedial order, including the decision to allocate a monitoring to help in its policy and its associated training program change.
The appeals court heard pleas on Tuesday on the request stay.
The appeal court has said that because he compromised the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and differed from the code of conduct for U.S. judges by the publicHe acted wrongly so the judge should be removed from the case, statements should be publicly responded to criticize the court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its punctuation and sports program.
He has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training, and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program for testing body worn cameras in some premises where he stops most.
In August, New York City agreed to abolish the practice of storing those names and addresses whose cases were rejected after a police ban.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after March 14, 2014.
Breaks and sports tactics have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and sports policy has been around decades in some form, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, has recorded an all-time high in 2011 from 684330 to an all-time high independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg under the administration of dramatically prevents growth.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men of all minorities and became a class action case.
Proponent of NYPD’s break and change in the sports program has said that improper behavior will end. A more reliable and effective police force will mould and may affect other police department’s policy to use..
Opponents say the change will reduce the morale of the police, but will solve a widespread problem of crime, money waste and a police force under pressure not shrunk by thousands of authorities during the last decade.
The judge has noted that there was no end for pauses and sports, which was constitutional, but had improved the implementation of the stop of the NYPD.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts joined a considerable number in the training.
Over a period of seven days, all participants were given information about many learnings, including tent pitching, flag poles.
The training is being completed in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All participants are spreading a sense of unity by joining the Sarvadharma prayer.
The Chief of the Camp Vipin Kumar State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Callson, former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret about Charles Clark's home secretary's love relationship.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The court said that the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Paulby's voicemail and "keep an eye" that male, but Callson also called and left his voicemail.
Prosecution side suggests that Mr. Callan, who is currently the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside the people’s house and keep an eye on them, but rather he puts articles before the people, see what people react to it.”
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, monitoring and face-to-face.
The third one himself joined the editor.
Direct, he knew the other way, that is, he was sure to know about the monitoring.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say “yes, he knew exactly”.
The rumor about Clark's love affairs was first introduced by AOTW's feature desk at the time when a sexually interested source in Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, that's with Charles."
Voicemail tape was seized at least three times of Ms. Paulby's phone, from home from Mulcare in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer on which Ms. Polby and his sister were named "Projects".
At the period in which he was being examined, information was sought about him by calling the anonymous near Ms. Paulby’s grandparents.
During this, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup looked at Ms. Polby's commuting and commuting monitoring.
On June 18, 2005, Callson told him through a voicemail: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that the involvement of Callson in this matter is only in the Parton with other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The Bench heard on Thursday that Callson had a conversation with Mr. Blanket about the relationship of love with a married woman, while at that time he was watching the case of co- defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Callson and Brooks refused to commit a misrepresentation with others to hack phones between October 3, 200, and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and WeatherUp have accepted phone hacking.
Promotion of corporate fears from NSA disclosures regarding state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter buzzed at the U.S. Consulate General in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the mission of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency was to take a picture of the outpost roof of the U.S., located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbank.
German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of listening antennas and indicated an exchange action between the German foreign ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US national intelligence, stressed that the US "does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal foreign companies' trade secrets and to raise or underline American companies to increase their international competitiveness."
But since Edward Snowdon, a contractor who made Whistleblower, began to tell American surveillance of his secrets, European government and business leaders are no longer sure that the director should not keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fear about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it turned out that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone bug was, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe’s most powerful individuals can be targeted, surely business leaders are also potentially aiming.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between American intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
Germany should wake up" says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by consultancy of German companies, the US has almost now become a big risk like China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowdon in all documentation, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. came to know the trade secrets of foreign companies for their companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the absence of the EU’s internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again...
Haso Plattner, president of the German business software company SAP, said "this is no way,".
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he didn’t have to die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany, from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations revealed by Snowden about US technical sophistication and spying reach have proved to be a trauma for some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat of China is
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that the data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted outside the Cloud Security Alliance, a business entity, some 10 per cent non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s co-CEO, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn’t come a year ago – that is – my data is stored called? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?”
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are just confirmed what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must be guarded at all costs on these.
It is not a surprise that economic espionage occurs.
It has always happened.
This is a topic for many years, and through fundamental current discussion, nothing changed" says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do, because it is in national interest to defend our business
Corporate leaders are generally not inclined about the defense system and are an advantage to the attacker.
For large companies, the message is being recorded for a long time whether leaving one in business from home is unwise to say at least it is unwise to take a USB stick, or leave a laptop in a hotel room unscrupulous.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of car manufacturers Audi, says it is a year-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they could not be used as remote listening devices.
Germany’s BfV executive advises you to consider using simple prepaid mobile when that smart phones are compromised due to exposure on foreign visits.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, it is the top of many companies in the global market in the special place.
Small and medium-sized companies often warn in a report “to effectively protect corporate secrets against lack of experience, unauthorized access to personnel and financial resources,” BfV.
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
France The Washington Post named U.S. national intelligence in February in a second tier of criminals who engage in hacking for economic intelligence, which followed China with Russia and Israel.
According to a German blue chip company board member when it comes to economic espionage, "Frenchs are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview: "The services are well-knowing that all countries spy on their allies, even if they accompany them in non-terrorist battles."
Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we also do, because it is in national interest to defend our business
No one became a fool.
Parents of teens in Georgia killed in a “unique accident” believe their son was murdered
A teenager from Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a restling mat in her high school gym, believes that her son was murdered, the family advocate said on Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. K. Kendrick Johnson was found stuck in the standing mats straight behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
The investigators at the Londes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson had died in a ‘unique accident’, but the 17-year-old boy’s family denied it.
Benjamin Kramp, advocate for presenting Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered".
They have no faith in death in the manner described by the Sheriff.
He believes that this is beyond the logic of physical law and general intelligence," he said.
They think this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag"
U.S. Advocate-General Michael Müller said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation about Johnson’s death, given that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Did he die because of a crime?
Murray said this at a journalist’s conference in the afternoon on Thursday.
I will comply with the facts, wherever they take us.
My purpose is to bring the truth out.
I think that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation," he added.
Moore told the reporter that the early autopsy test indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional respiration".
According to Moore, by the way a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death."
There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed," he added.
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to summon a criminal or investigate civil rights in Johnson’s death case, he would ask the FBI to do it.
The representative was not instantly available for comment from the Office of the Lodge County Sheriff when contacted Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Southern Georgia judge ordered the authorities to issue all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy’s parents say they hope video footage will give some indications of how he died.
CDC issued Children’s Allergic Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children’s food allergies in school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of children going to school are increasing to suffer from food allergies.
Now each one of 20 baby food in the U.S. is allergic.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergy cases in children have increased by 18 percent.
In this direction, information has been given to schools for how to inform teachers and staff about children’s food allergies, and in case of any allergic reaction, how to handle it.
Schools have also been suggested to have a stock of epinephrine to potentially withstand life-threatening anaphylaxis – the auto-injector of the Apppen brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated in regulations, allowing schools to place a large amount of epinephrine stocks easily.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reaction.
Children may say "It looks like something is pricking my tongue," "It looks like I have hair on my tongue," or "I'm tingling my tongue."
Parents of Intersex Kids can choose the ‘gender unscheduled’ of their children
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize the third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
No longer will newborns be conscientiously assigned to men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender ‘undefined’ or “unspecified” on the child’s birth certificate.
The new law aims to ease pressure on parents who can make gender-specific surgical decisions for newborns in a hurry, and to struggle against intersex children from discrimination.
According to BBC, an intersex person had said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will continue to be injured, stained by doctors.
According to estimates, one of 2,000 children each year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the investigation of gender development disorders, it is the collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (ovary or testis), or abnormally developed penis.
Wallis Simpson may have been Intersex.
Gender identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that it is better to use the best information available to specify gender when gender-determining cannot occur and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before conducting surgery, if such a thing arises.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender-identity cases, said Germany’s new law “looks good.”
Intersex children create moral confusion.
Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but it does not happen to most children,” he said.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a proper answer about why this happens.
This is a kind of puzzle that why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in 2011, intersex people are described as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to gender but related to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female but either a combined form of both or neither is clearly defined.
These characteristics may display secondary sexual characters, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characters such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
This report provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as the harassment, violence, and bias offences.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming genders.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori May-Valby became the world’s first recognized “penisless” person after winning a legal appeal to hold the “unspecified” gender status throughout life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will also have third specifications as X for Intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighboring countries France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strict Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw the "sex theory" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany saying, “While the world is going to a state where the gender is the option to be chosen, but not the sexual activity, we are taking two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction.”
The newborn baby's mother in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would love to see babies specifying genders at birth.
Raising without additional limitations is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is," he said on the website about raising.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bisexuals), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bilingual.
And about less than a decade ago, the medical world treated the penis as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender-identity is complex work, and sometimes there can be mistakes from physicians who do not know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
Dresher says "In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called "Psychiatric emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you used to call the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money from John Hapkins University, who considered the penis to be unsuitable.
He composed the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental indications — how parents raise the child — determine by interacting with the child’s genes and hormones to identify him as a male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", their theories became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child, whose sex had gone to the penis in an accident during the circumcision, to get his testicles removed by making full bound of the child and follow him like a girl.
Money presented the case as a successful case of a transition, but it did not happen," Dresher said.
At the age of 15, the child turned back as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years since 1990, individuals undergoing these gender surgery began to come out "not happy with the result".
The same case was with Jim Bruce, 36-year-old author of Montana, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but her genitalia was ambiguous.
Physicians did not clearly understand whether his penis was small, or his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So shortly after he was born in 1976, Bruce's outer limbs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised like a girl.
She was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn’t happy, but it was very hard to question.
At the age of 18, vaginoplasty was going to happen with him.
But feeling depressed and upset, he demanded medical records.
This showed him the terrible truth.
I was bound at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., who prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became back male, took the dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
He became barren due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called Interface Project to normalize their perception.
But, Anne Tammer-Matis, executive director of California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany’s law “invits chippies and stigmas.”
Many activist people think that Germany’s law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and "determined" the child," she says.
We fear that it will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying a male or female gender is a better process.
But we don’t know how the law will play its role, so we can just guess.
Tammer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized in the third gender."
Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal gender," he said.
The law of Germany deals with specifying it at birth.
It is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When growing up, they can make their own body-related decisions.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlene Baratz, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law would "power" both parents and children.
Baratji’s daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but had a DSD called Full Androgen Insensitivity Symptoms.
As there was a defect in her androgen receptor, female characters developed in Katy.
The vagina in her body is not so but the uterus or ovarian.
Now 29-year-old Katy is married and resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to be a mother through adoption or gueststational surrogacy.
This law allows parents to make no decisions on their own in a hurry," Baratz said.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by certain tests before writing ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you live well - raise the baby, love the baby.
You have a cute baby and enjoy it.
We don’t have to rush to get a surgery that can’t be returned.
It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the infuriating anxiety because they don’t believe they are healing,” he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for their own self.
Legal Awareness Camp was organized by Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar on behalf of the committee chairman and under the chairmanship of Sub Judge Sandeep Kaur of Ramnagar, Middle School Dalher of Ramnagar.
In which the law was given information to the students and others for the right to education and for the economically backward people.
In the camp, Advocate ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch made people aware while speaking on the said subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Considering Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama’s close advisers secretly considered Hillary Clinton to replace Biden for the post of Vice President for the ticket 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is that Mark Halperin and John Helleman heavily anticipated 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that what dumping Biden could help in Obama’s falling hope of re-election to learn the president’s top advisers held “comprehensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011.”
According to the Times National Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides complete information about the efforts of the chief officers in the campaign and the White House, the head of the former White House staff for the name billed, to know what the impact of former state secretary Clinton's change from vice president on the pole.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half dozen president's close advisers – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Paloffe – knew the change was under consideration.
The "double down" claim that Daley tried to change Biden despite his personal rapport when he was finally informed that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Daley has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton’s place with Biden.
I said keeping the whole scene in eye, and one of them, it was", Dale said to the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a situation like, “Holy Christ, what else will we do?”
While Dale described research as "cautious", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign made significant investments in finding how much dividend the claim would give when the pole was in place.
Campaigns don't spend money-like voting and focusing on groups as long as they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, though, what Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley did his boss know about possible reshuffle?
While Dale said he didn't think the president knew about a possible change", the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
The "double down" isn't sure whether a political investigation took place at Obama's desk," Martin said.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was not aware of Biden dumping ticket research.
Possibly," said Martin.
Glow-in-the- Dark Ice Cream Likes?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the marine animal to develop the finest breakfast.
The idea came after reading a research paper on jellyfish and China’s convinced scientists used chemical gloss to re-polize the protein.
Ice creams, eaters that react with the tongue to raise the pH level of the protein and ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream ignites with the heat of the mouth reacting, that is, winning will lick more, the more it will ignite.
Charlie, founder of Liquemy Im Delisius Ice Cream Company, said: "This is something incredible but early days of production will get me about 2 grams of goods from £200".
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm the protein will raise the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We have been testing for the past few months and feel perfect to share it on Halloween because it gives amazing glow effect
It will probably be the most expensive ice cream I have made because the radiance of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However Iska taste is very good.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual taste, including beer, cheese, meat, and gold leaf.
But her next creation is going to prove even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is natural impossible because of ice crystals that make refraction over ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is the utility of the fluorescence properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was attributable to the customers in the Rani Bagh Market.
The recent situation was that people had to wait from 15 to 20 minutes to buy pots.
This was the case in the Central Market located at Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Prashant Vihar.
A similar view was also seen at the Sarafa shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
People here also bought gold and silver jewelry and coins fiercely.
Due to this, jams were also being installed in other markets, including the outer ring road.
However, people who left the office for the house had to spend hours in jam to reach the house.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late silent and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I have become more than a hunk
I did not even sign in to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and maybe this year will not be so.
But statistics tell me that there is a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million Halloween this time., $6.9 billion will spend on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing that I have always seen in it is the tendencies of every Halloween.
Total expenses according to NRF are $1.2 billion in style of dress expenses out of $6.9 billion
This year all is angry with sexy inanimate things.
Women don't have to prostitution; because that's sexy food like pizza, hamburgers, and carrots too.
I hope for men that a lot of zombies, and thanks to the changing space of dead will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfit will be zombies, batmans, robbers, and witches.
I guess there is no evil in being traditional.
Last year we dressed dogs and weren’t alone by surprise.
According to the NRF, American people will literally spend $330 million for pet costumes.
It is ironic that lots of hotdogs are with dogs.
We don’t look around when it comes to candy.
According to Nilsen Company, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
Hairshy bars, lollipops, milk dudes, twislers and clark bars are around 600 million pounds.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it is a good news that 41 million tricks and tricks are participating in our neighbourhood.
But in reality we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we will not use is candycorns during Halloween, but that too will be sold for about 35 million pounds.
He is the personal kernels of maize about 9 billion.
This is a mystery. Yet to solve
Nothing is more elemental than Halloween haunted haunted haunted haunted haunted haunted haunted haunted by.
They are the best name, like "the horror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "squeak-o-squeak" and "house of shock."
According to American power, there is a 1200 officially sanctioned ghost house in the United States that generates 500 million revenues, and the awesome good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments you see Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk of pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - this is something we have done since we were little.
From luck to us, there were "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" that started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not living with them.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. will spend around $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o-gently withered lantern on its front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional loans, try to carve their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin over phone Tim and Susan the mermaids in Napa, Caliph., and above.

The cracker traders’ dream of doing business in the cracker market in the transport area did not come true.
Cracker traders are stuck in the beggars after the High Court order.
Neither now they can do business in the temporary cracker market created at Ranjit Avenue, nor are they issued licenses for business in the transport area.
The commission formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary cracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
Due to lack of proper management there, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar also got a fine of Rs 10 lakh.
The High Court in its order has rebuked the administrative officers of Amritsar fiercely and said what kind of administration that could not solve even a problem of cracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided a proper place in the city.
After this, by managing proper security, crackers traders were asked to issue a license for business in the market located in Shipgarh.
After this order even though crackers traders were happy, the police turned the water on Friday over their happiness.
The team of the police realha license branch reached the cracker market and sold the farm by putting a counter there.
The conditions that were then told to them were impossible to complete in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharge of Aslah License Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma arrived at the cracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by crackers traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to crackers traders.
Deepawali has left the rest of the day.
Due to this, cracker traders are upset.
They are seeing a loss of crores of rupees.
Cracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say that if they lose crores of rupees they will claim the district administration.
Angry crackers traders took out Rosh March on Friday night from the shipguard to Ranjit Avenue.
He shouted slogans against police and district administration.
After this, the temporary cracker running at Ranjit Avenue also closed the business in the market.
In a mine, a fire team was called to save a lost puppy at the face of a distressed mountain, 50 feet above the ground.
Cocker spaniel ruby ran away after getting into a small road collision
He was seen three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock from the rope to protect the dog from death’s mouth
After the puppy somehow got stuck on the face of a distressed mountain 50 feet above the ground, the firefighter personnel were summoned to give him a fortunate life.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away on Sunday afternoon after getting into a road collision and spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet again with Denholm, Ruby, and he thanked the Western Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, after he ran away, he had discovered his lost dog like crazy, and had posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp eye dock walker saw Ruby on the mountain in the mine at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station arrived at the spot and lowered by rope to rescue Ruby and used a belly tube to bring him down from the rock.
Expert technical defense officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a critical state.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, up and down to 50 feet.
She did not do a single act during the rescue, she remained the stone.
But now that's good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
This was a very unusual call for help.
Rather, it is incredible to see a dog.
Special technical defense officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is fortunately left."
It was likely to be seriously hurt or even worse.
Ruby was taken to a vet for investigation, where she was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire said: "It was terrible to see rescue work"
At first, I didn’t even believe how she got there.
It's awesome to get her back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she got very tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire extinguisher did a great job.
What they did is really a very courageous task.
We are his unbearable, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Alderson from Kigly also said: "We were afraid she could fall, but she stayed there."
The fire extinguisher did a great job.
I don’t believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, he didn’t hit her
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and “when I was 18, he hit me.”
He said, “This thing turned out to be old, and he treats me well.”
The 70-year-old Jagger’s representative said in a statement on Thursday that he “clearly refuses to strike Katy Perry at any time.”
The representative also said: "Possibly Perry, in another person's misunderstanding, is saying about him"
Parry was one of the upcoming singers as a guest at Rolling Stone's tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Kervan: Euro Disintegration gave Scotts a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area across Europe as a condition of a membership of the EU.
The passport control on Barwick and the barbed wire on the walls of Hadrian indicate stories about the border.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the possible economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - this was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels will be inexpensive discounts for non-compliance Brussels in exchange for what it actually wants from Scotland.
So, then again, the A-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has solidified. First of all I heard the "freedom means passport control" ungrounded news about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point in retelling this interesting old story was lost.
Why should one expect independent Scotland to bid Europe anyway?
Why buy and sell London Yoke to Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Dedicated parties are strengthening to oppose the EU or close the euro as the same currency throughout the EU.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptil Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly came and received about fifty million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own lib dames) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical one.
With the stringent regulations imposed by the Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that the project Europe has gone too far due to the constraints imposed on national economies through complying with the same currency.
The euro’s crisis did not have a very high role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments — it was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system fixed the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters to its members - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a state of loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce salaries and public expenditure – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Deeper than current budgets and currency problems, European productivity is morbid.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay double for electricity and four times for gas than the United Nations - to provide a discount to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers.
This is the cost loss that we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even when all salaries in the world are frozen, European petrochemicals cannot protect the industry from being affected by cheaper U.S. shale gas.
As a result people are feeling of rebellion, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France’s top politicians saw the EU as a measure to keep Germany under control, and Paris as providing a billing equivalent to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, causing France’s economy to stagger.
Result: Marine Lee Penn’s right wing, the anti-EU National Front has conquered the recent by-election by pushing the ruling socialist to third place.
At the moment the front in France is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote - it's the time-warning for British Labour that they can't walk assuming that dissolution for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Penn doing with his new enjoyed fame among the French Europeans, working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections to be held next year to form an anti-EU, anti-Nervosa faction in the European Parliament.
If, as much as possible, the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections, then this type of faction may affect the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the confluence of the anti-EU and anti-semitural anti-currency sentiment in Europe will eliminate the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will return in some form, such as "Europe of the (Sovereign) nations", which would support General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its pertinent economies may sustain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from the project in the hope of raising closeness with the U.S.
However, the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to remain the territory (essentially) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to be separated at the right time.
I think Scotland could do better in loose European order, provided we keep our own currency.
Non-federal nations will find it easier to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic freedom while walking the route to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – has been the most successful anti-fraying political campaign in Europe, which had won an astonishing majority in 2011 on the basis of opposition to the (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour’s chancellor Alistair Darling and followed by the Tory-Lib Dam alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, as in that case it has to accept the rules of frugality imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at an early age than their older white girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreak, at a young age can be a cause of puberty
Premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheriz, a former correspondent of CNN, is an expert journalist in the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and having genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
This week at the U.S. Pediatric Academy annual conference in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz clarified that these early physiological changes are commonplace among American girls, indicating these new trends.
I spend a lot of time giving parents the trust - that generally it does not reflect the rapid progress towards full puberty," said Caplovitz.
The direct signs of growth such as sprouting of breasts, genital and underarm hair and physical odor are prematurely visible in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very minor change in the age of Rajodarshan (1st menstrual cycle).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
Caplovitz explains, who is also the author of the "Premature puberty in girls: the essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
The most accurate test of puberty development is time.
There is an argument about what the onset of puberty is, but when it increases with breast development before the age of 8, two call it "child-adult".
In most cases this procedure will slow down or stop - which pediatricians can observe closely.
An investigation by an endocrinologist may be required in case of more rapid progress so that the possibilities of serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be overcome.
Treatments for delaying premature menstruation and other consequences are: premature age-growth of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and less stature as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child’s age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of drugs but admits, “Clamping puberty can increase behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel different from their peers.”
The other big problem can be understood: Parents simply don’t want their underage daughter to have menstruation.
They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," said Caplovitz.
A woman whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10 recalls, “This was a shock.”
Although there were symptoms of this and we also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared of her school and returned upset that she first started menstruating in her girlfriends.
There are many well-known principles about the causes of untimely puberty.
Nevertheless, there is no continuing evidence that milk or other foods may be charged with hormones, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media.
Boys too - just like girls - are getting premature puberty.
Caplovitz rules determine that the main reason for this is the outbreak of obesity.
He helped in conducting studies on girls 6 to 9 years old in the year 2001, which combines body fat with puberty time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their ageing blonde girls.
There are many explanations of this.
At the global level, the pattern of premature puberty appears to be influenced by all things, from economic conditions to weather and jeans.
Other puzzles: although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a young age, the full puberty is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other practitioners attending the AAP conference supported the complexity of the topic.
Even in infants and children it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
We need to be careful about how we identify the actual start of puberty," says Dr. Laurens Silverman, pediatrician endocrinologist at Goreb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician about how to talk to their children to seek opinions.
Caplovitz advised, "It may mean having a conversation ahead of the expected time."
If you remain calm, your child will usually answer properly.
Girls developing prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely but it is part of normal life.
Temperatures registered a 3.1 °C drop on Thursday.
Rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wore sweaters to the markets and their destinations.
People have also taken out the quilt when it is the first rain of winter.
In the morning, people were seen enjoying the sun.
As the weather changed, there will also be a lot of relief from colds and disease, but after that, due to clouding throughout the day, the sun and shade continued.
Children also reached their school by wearing sweaters.
At the same time, according to the Air Force weather department, the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 °C and the minimum temperature was 13.7 °C.
While 7.8 mm of rain was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, there will be clouds on the sky even further.
At stake large orders of jet manufacturers from dispute to seat width.
This month's Dubai Airshow has set a stranglehold for fights between aircraft manufacturers leading to the breadth of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights
The dispute focuses on the width of the economy class seat in the planes of long flights, not as always given by airlines but whose allotted space efficiency is claimed to be key by the latest Jet Erbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Erbus is expected to give at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide seats in the economy cabin this week but it should be decided by the airlines, his main rival, Boeing says.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when a possible recorded order after the 17-21 event competed to sell the larger version of the twin engine of the long-range aircraft.
How has the previous department of the aircraft been built- especially if the seating is 9 or 10. Is the design of mini jumbo jets being designed keeping in mind the high capacity claims?
Boeing says it has created "777 X" which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in a unitary department.
Airbus says it will take 350 people to the 18-inch left 9 equal laid seat while competing with A350.
Aircraft giants often strike trade on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, Airbus is expected to dominate more than 100 orders at Dubai Arsho with 777 X, which is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that anything has been the beginning of the Wigian war, showing this to Finnsero, together in a restaurant, three together will you accept it?
Airbus sales head John Lehi said "Boing is also offering long-distance flight from regional turbo into narrow seats".
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the plane sits hasn’t changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health data between the 1970s when Boeing 747 defined jumbo ne modern long ki journey tha, and the ant me average of the century increased by 40 - 49-year-old American male ke weight me 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, in the 21st century, the average American male waist is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its opponent sticks to a 1950 seat concept when the average perimeter of the new name "jet set" was narrow.
Airbus says they have set up a research commission that suggests an additional inch of 53 per cent sleep quality improvement in the width of the seat.
Boeing disputed the airbus seat measurement figures, and said that it is not up to manufacturers' decision on how airlines get a balance between rent and facilities.
It also says, the research shows the width of a seat over depends on the experience of the cabin.
This actually points out what needs to be done in providing flexibility to airlines and on things they believe need to be successful," said Kent Craver, a Boeing cabin expert.
They don't want to tell us who benefits them".
They know their business better than anyone else.
This elbow room for flyers is about, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade style behind this controversy is at least $700 billion. The competition of aircraft orders is enough, in the coming decades, to tip the scales of American and European exports.
Reuters reported for the first time in July, what seat layout is actually the battle issue between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 percent of the work efficiency per seat had occurred in their new twin-engine design, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 ER of that segment.
The performance claim of Boeing depends on the comparison with the 777 design of the 10th 777 X One original 9.
The 10 equivalent with the profit in unit cost has now been using comparisons.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe’s Airbus passenger convenience says “Boing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats”.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-per-line cabin is in favor of the Danser layout of many passengers suggesting for the current 777 S, which can go with cheap rent as well.
The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of the offer 777", said the runway girl network of the cabin interior expert My Curb, Founder and Editor.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but provide a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers around the world also take careful measures to check on this layout event.
More relaxed, all builders are also offering low-cost aircraft services of jets and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus giving O a 10 equivalent A350 but says it is not sold right now.
But as of recently, Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jets for more cabin convenience needs.
Modern jets fly on a new industry standard, without the support of other manufacturers is unlikely but it can deviate from the wave of sales of 777 X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Can End Smoking Joy
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun of smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to keep rats safe from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
Further testing is needed before testing is started on man, which may take years, but Ronald Crystal, professor of Veal Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs are positive.
We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually assist millions of smokers who have attempted to quit smoking using all the methods available in the market in today’s time, but they found that their nicotine addiction is much more powerful than these existing methods.”
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been prepared to deliver genetic information for the purpose of producing anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent the nicotine from ingestion within the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccine given rats that were given nicotine later continued to perform their normal activity.
Researchers say that but the rat that was not given the vaccine was "good", it was a sign that Nicotine had reached his brain.
The experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Vaccines for earlier tobacco had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give a dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine is expected to cost a lot, as the liver will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the temptation to try cigarettes, thereby protecting them from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
They will know that if they start smoking again they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to the nicotine vaccine, which can help them to get used to.
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to be researched a lot.
Even after the post-mortem, the tigress could not get exposed due to the actual cause of death.
The Forest Department is describing the death of the first sighted tigress as natural, giving a circular reply about this.
On Thursday night, the forest personnel of Ramnagar forest division got the body of a tigress near Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve Khichdi Nale.
All the organs of the tigress body were safe as well as there were no wounds or bruises on it.
On Friday, the body of the tigress was post-mortemed by the veterinarian Bharat and Kotabagh veterinarian Hema Rathore of CTR in the presence of forest conservator Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Kahaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki.
According to sources, the tiger’s internal bodies are being told to be damaged during the post-mortem.
This did not find out the reasons for the actual death of the tigress.
On the death of the tigress, departmental officers continued to respond round-the-clock.
Yet the tiger’s internal organs have been sent to the IVRI Bareilly for a topicological investigation to confirm the poison.
Conservator of Forests Western Circle Vivek Pandey informed that the death of the tigress can only be called natural.
No symptoms of poison etc. have been found from the body of tigress.
Yet, with the surrounding area being searched for it, Bisera is sending the probe to confirm the poison.
Let's deny us being influenced by Tripodi Obide.
The former NSW labor minister Joe Tripody will be examined by the State Corruption Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody has refused to refute the policy of his political master Eddie Obide on request of former New South Wales guardian Eddie Obide, who had hidden selfishness in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) detailed the investigation on Friday whether Mr. Obide, for violating the circulars of lobbying lease policy from several state ministers, where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obide, without tenders, were renewed after his expiration in August 2005.
After the evidence given by Lin Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff on Thursday, this allegation of Mr. Tripodi knew the hidden selfishness of Mr. Obide? is now being investigated.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressured the leases to be launched for public tenders.
The lessees were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circular enterprises for the leases, from which Obide earned $2.5 million annually, were renewed from tenders without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of Public Tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obide, Mr. Tripody urged for a change in the government lease policy
In August and September 2007, Mr. Obide and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obide after the Ministry of Ports worked in a phone call.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "What was being discussed in the telephone conversation of the commercial lease policy development case,?"
No," Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Surely not between me and Mr. Obide.
Officials say Israeli fighters stormed Syria.
Israeli fighters targeted Syria’s port city Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed Fox News.
The officer did not tell what the motive was, but there was at least one motive there.
The Associated Press report states that the target Russian missile was SA-125.
Israel has already carried out air strikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice a year ago.
457 Foreign workers on visas can go through a "authentication" test
A "authentication" test for foreign employees is being considered by the government on a 457 visa, as it aims to expand a rigorous proceeding.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a criterion designed to prevent 457 used to fill in unskilled positions in Australia or to deliver to family and friends in a disguised manner.
A government discussion paper was issued today, blaspheming the government’s syllabi about foreign employees, former Labour M.P. Maxine McCuney said today that it could infuriate the neighbouring countries of Australia.
He told the US India Institute today that “foreigners are arriving at the end of the queue’ and vigorous rhetoric about “the job first of the Australians” is a very unpleasant duplication at a time when unions have demanded a safe labour market.”
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected — and if some people in the area had seen an echo of that historical evidence, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about traffickers, has executed five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authentication" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined about "whether nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee is the owner of the visa sponsoring person or the personal partner of the person who is consistent".
Businessmen may need to count the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after coming into a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s distressed nine-year-old son had come with him to Australia on a journey, and on Wednesday, after his father’s death, an adult cousin has tied up the Dhandas, who was on the same vessel.
The Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer informed that the project "will unite the UK."
By working with the UK government on this project they are very "excited", Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said.
The first phase will include the new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
Once the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd. to consider the rail capacity for Northern England and Scotland and the possibilities of further improving travel time.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for a "clear" return of Scotland to the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed rail, but this will also increase the economic load on Scotland in the entire case of high-speed rail across the UK.
That’s why we are excited to work in partnership with the British government, so that we can check options to bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create profits for everyone, and fulfil the Glasgow-Edinburg line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the ministers of the British government the following year and making decisions together on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will be effective in Australia right now
Despite the steps to soften equipment related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers must continue to turn off their tablets and smart phones while flying and landing on the plane.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left US aircraft service companies open options to change their processes, so passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during important flight phases, provided those equipment remains in the "Aeroplane" mode.
Passengers can do this during a lot of flights right now, but many people don’t like to be unable to fly and access their e-book etc. while landing on the plane.
Australian aeroplane service companies are considering this decision, according to which US aeroplane service companies will have to act a lot to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they do not have any immediate plans to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the declaration, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective in the critical stages of flight in Australia.
At present, CASA has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, "this issue comes under regulations, according to which the airlines have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
The virgin who is already negotiating with the CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is ready to follow this change, but she asked to take further action on the regulator’s instruction.
We will welcome reviews by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel it will provide customers with a better experience, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes.
Quantas said that it will follow the current rules right now.
Electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing the aircraft as per our current policy, and we have no immediate plan to change it," it said.
FAA decisions, apply to US allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travelers and we will definitely consider the decision of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio personalization from mobile devices, as well as amend their rule books, training materials, carry-on baggage programs, and brief descriptions to passengers.
He will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones at all heights after the airline verifies the tolerance of their aircraft," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing the aircraft.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment under the seat safely or in the upper compartments while flying and landing the aircraft.
Silver of ponbrokers due to difficulty being felt by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirathlinga at the Bonshop at Bendmeer Shopping Centre in Singapore is taking cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter’s school fees.
My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it," Mrs. Amirathlinga said.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also does the job, the family’s monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, parts of South-East Asia have a similar demand — where domestic debt is increasing — ValueMax became the third pounshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week where they are making their transactions.
Jewellery pledging is not the only way to get cash – 1,300 Singapore dollars in terms of Ms. Amirathlinga – but also as cheap as an almost unsecured bank loan.
Pawnbrokers in Singapore generally charge interest 17 per cent per annum, only slightly higher than 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, which is the local lender having a branch in the same shopping centre.
Pawnbrokers, however, have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of pay, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are turning to a pounshop due to the increased living expenses by households and the difficulty faced by the increase in household and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and after cheap credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to a ponshop to meet their requirements due to the slowdown in their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standard’s Age Poor’s, mainly attributed the rising domestic gains due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ indebtedness.
It said that Asia has the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia has topped the list with 80 per cent of GDP, while in 2008 it was 60 per cent.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer loans in Thailand, which have emerged light from the technology slowdown this week.
On Thursday, data has shown a steady export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
The conclusive point is that with the rising prices, those in the middle to the lower section of the [income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way," said economist Song Seng Wun at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to mortgage personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 percent of items pledging are gold in 200 pon outlets in the city-state.
People are saying, "The gold rate looks good, let's pledge the grandmother's gold chain, and will withdraw next month.
Thailand’s largest poonshop operator, Ezymoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
There is such an increase in the business of pledging that the operators of the outlet in Bendimir are planning to expand in Valuemax and Singapore like 15 others, not only in their neighbourhood, in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Ya Li Ching, Executive Director of Valuemx.
The company will finance it with 60 percent use of 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticized due to high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledging not only gets cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly increase credit.
Customers pledge items that they already have, and cashing out individual assets does not increase domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and secure financial support.
It is not that only financially weak individuals use ponbrokers.
Wealthy individuals in Singapore also use the ValueMax outlet, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches that can pay up to 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all sections of society.
These include wealthy individuals who need a short term loan for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements,” Ms. Yah says.
Sometimes they only need money in a very short time.
India’s biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani’s wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on 1 November 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very big party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend this party. On the late evening of 31 October, many big stars were seen catching Jodhpur’s flight at Mumbai airport.
These stars include Karishma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and her wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, etc.
Obviously, you can guess how big this burning will be when such big names are included in the party.
325 million dollar rescue package for the health of the Tazi
The Union government has insisted that stringent conditions are also associated with a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s becoming ill health system which will ensure that the state government cannot waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is “immediately taking action” to address the current crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the limitations of the system.
The funding decision to be made during the four years was made after consultation with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Wilkey.
The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges faced by the state.
The package of 325 million dollars also includes an optional surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will assist in resolving past collected cases.
It also includes funds for the walk-in clinic in Hobart and Lawnstation, better care after going from hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services, and personal electronic health record system in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the best ways I am told to improve Tasmania’s health system by leading physicians,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister emphasized that Tasmania government will face strict reporting and accountability governance.
The state has to maintain the current funding level in order to receive Commonwealth wealth, and report each month where additional funds are being spent.
The Commission of three members will be constituted to ensure that service is provided by the State in the effective and efficient manner as possible.
Mr. Wilki said that $325 million would not mean too much, "unless real improvements have been made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level."
Yet he praised the government for reacting to their request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May."
I hope the federal aid package will be very helpful to differentiate the state Re public health system from the crisis-hit list," Mr. Wilki said.
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will mainly undo recent cuts.
But the Federal Opposition Health Spokesperson Peter Dutton believes that today’s announcement is “band-aid solution.”
We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You cannot consider the state government to carry about half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth to pay $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plybersek should guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The novel by Dennis Diderot features details of the finest production design and time period in conversion by Guillaume Niklaux, but it has far exceeded what it should have been.
Depicting France’s time in 1760, the novel tells the tragic tale of Sujan, the young nobles that his family member sends the convent.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the arbitrary sadistic Mother Superior, and becomes the object of sensual attraction for the second.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
It also risks becoming a boring film for the audience due to the strong seriousness of narrative.

The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to build its chemical weapons
The monitoring group on Thursday said Syria has destroyed important tools to create chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while fierce conflicts emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the location where toxic agents are considered to have been kept.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that around 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Syrian Civil War that began nearly three years ago.
This announcement of the Chemical Weapons Prohibition Organization took place a day before the last date of 1 November
Which was determined by the Hague-based organization to destroy or "ineffectively" the machinery used for mixing chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and filling in war materials.
The completion of the early stage of destruction primarily is the meaningful milestone in this ambitious event that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of the Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying equipment means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, the dumps still have to destroy the weapons and collections that exist.
Syria is believed to have 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Siren.
The UK situation is reported by Syrian Observatory for Human Rights that this announcement took place on Thursday when the conflict in the city of Saphira increased, which experts believe is the same collection center as that of the chemical arms production unit.
The movement group, which details the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
She has said that it includes 61,067 common citizens, including 6,365 children.
The government stated that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of Assad’s military army, 18,678 are fighting fighters in favour of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hizbullah militants.
It also said that the dead have 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It did not update the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this struggle.
Assad’s military team continued to wage wars with rebels for several weeks at Saphira, many of whom belonged to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, Observatory said that there were casualties on both sides, but clearly nothing was said.
This war shows the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons who, in a very short timeframe, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The statement to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, said its team "is yet to be satisfied and has confirmed it - and has seen all of Syria's declared important production and mixing/filling equipment - as destroyed."
There is no further inspection activity being planned,” it also said.
Earlier this week, inspectors had said that they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 centres out of the 23 centres announced by Dumas.
Inspectors said that they were not able to visit two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, OPCW said that according to Syria, these two centers were "disbanded and... the chemical weapon product items placed there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Saphira is one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has presented plans for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of OPCW next month.
I salute the perseverance and courage you have demonstrated in completing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," said Amat Ujumku, director general of the group that supervises in the comments released by OPCW.
This civil war, which lasted for three years, is primarily a conflict between the government of Assad and its security forces, including members of the Al-Olite sect, originating from Shia Islam, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdurahman, said that the air defense center in Latakia, the coastal area of Syria, had exploded strongly on Wednesday.
He said that the reason for this explosion is not yet known.
Police have recovered photo copies of forged registry, forged seals, laptops and forged registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case on all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajeev Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Dhumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Dhumar Mandi of Dhumar.
Balbir Singh has absconded from the spot of the Registrar Office (East).
According to the police, along with the clerk and recordkeeper Balbir Singh of the registrar’s office, used to remove papers from the records of empty and old lands and after that buy new stamp papers and prepare fake registry on them.
Not only this, but after that, the original registry was disappeared and put on a forged registry record.
After this, the accused used to sell the land on forged papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these forged papers.
After this, the real owner of the land would continue to stumble over the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the forged registry used to keep a special eye on the land of the NRIG.
Because there is no one who oversees the land of the NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare and sell forged registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused in the interrogation said that they have prepared fake registries close to 150 so far.
According to the police, there are cases of fraud and theft against the gang’s gangster Rajiv earlier also.
Outrage over the sentence of the conspiring bombing in Bali
In 2002, the family and relatives of 202 people killed in a bomb blast, resent the punishment given to the conspirators of the bomb blast, saying that Umar Patek should face the firing team.
Pattek, who ran as one of South-East Asia’s most wanted persons for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in producing explosive devices used in bombings.
He can be released in 15 years if a parole is given.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded a lot.
He was also found guilty of many other allegations related to terrorism, including a series of bombings carried out in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded a life imprisonment sentence, although they could also demand that this person, called the notorious “dismantling person” as the master person who created the bomb, had a death penalty.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of the woman June Cortine who lived in Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspiracy a decade ago.
Preventing his tears, he said that the patec should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other dangerous terrorists.
He should be put in front of the firing team," Ms. Cortin told AAP.
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
Immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, the nomination of the club was wiped out after the explosion of bombs loaded in the parked van outside The All Club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddies bar just 20 seconds before the explosive material backpack was exploded by suicide bombers.
They moved into a month-long coma as a result of the incident of this bombing and had “death” three times during their stay on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Petch should have received the same punishment, which three other members of Jemmah Islamiah terror group responsible for this genocide – Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person must be given a death penalty before someone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and innumerable people have been injured, it is not enough to get a sentence of 20 years.
Pattek is the last person to be punished with Bali bomb explosives.
He avoided being caught for nearly a decade, but eventually in January 2011, Pakistan was arrested in Abattabad, where the U.S. military killed former Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent submitted evidence that the report showed that Petch was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contacts between South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
She did not surrender,” says Ms. Cortine.
Even today, he does not really suffer from mental suffering to so many people.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
There will be a lot of tears this year,” Ms. Cortin said.
Still, Petch can appeal against his penalty.
FAA: Aeroplane passengers can now use the gadget in the aircraft (but cannot call from the cell phone)
Aeroplane passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate to landing from the gate - but will not be able to talk to their cellphone - this is under the highly-predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes instantly.
Michael Huerta, administrator of the FAA at a news conference, said that how fast these changes are implemented will vary in each airline.
The airlines must show the FAA how their aircraft complete the new guidelines and how their crew members are updating their training manuals and rules for collecting the device to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
Based on the status of the plan, we can very quickly approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA said in a statement.
At the moment, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are expected not to turn them until the aircraft reaches a height of 10,000 feet and is allowed by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when the plane lands, and not turn it on until the plane is completely removed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruption may allow their passengers to fly by plane, use the device while landing the plane and at the time of taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendant, has welcomed these changes.
When the policy is implemented in a safe manner – and we will work closely with airlines to do so – it will be a win-win thing for both parties,” Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue we are bored to feel like "Hall Monitors".
But it will still be restricted to surf, exchange emails, send or receive messages, or download data by connecting the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in Airplane mode.
So there will still be no interaction with friends, a game like Online Scrabble, the famous phenomenon associated with which is that when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while staying at the plane park at the gate in 2011, and when he refused to turn off the device, American airlines took him off the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be stored because their bouncing will cause injuries to the other person in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory authority relating to phone calls is vested with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
F.A.A. may remove restrictions on some electronic devices during flight and landing of the aircraft.
Last month mark Rozenkan of the National Transport Security Board, which is a National Transport Security Expert of CBS News, said that the cell phone is still considered a risk.
Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but also because they can interfere with cell phone towers when in the air.
To examine the issue, the Industry Advisory Committee formed by the FAA has last month recommended that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce restrictions from their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskillak, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for the prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult to enforce because the device is ubiquitous to use.
Some studies also indicate that about thirds of passengers forget or ignore instructions on turning off their device.
FAA started restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports of disruption in navigation and communication devices were received by passengers due to FM radio and carrying high-technology gadgets of that time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by FAA to be resistance to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi access at cruising height for travelers for many years.
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Most airlines must meet the eligibility criteria for more use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huarta said.
Today's electronic devices emit a much lower power radio transmission than previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have a fairly nominal transmission during page reversal.
But transmissions prevail when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of the pioneers of reducing the restrictions on device usage by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s officers loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in the airlines and blew them up to test the problems but found no such problem.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks arising from the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aeroplane Passenger Union said that he believes that the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, the aircraft system has only reports described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device at the time the aircraft was unloaded in low visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and has called them a general knowledge facility of people traveling in the latest rounds of technology.
Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, said that we are happy that the FAA has recognized that traveling with joy is not inconsistent with passenger, rescue and security.
Learning from the serial bomb blasts that took place in Patna, the UT Police has geared up for quick reaction during the celebration of Diwali in the wake of security and during that time of emergency circumstances.
A total of 1800 soldiers will be patrolling and patrolling all the main places in the city, including vehicles in crowded markets and other places to keep the traffic system running smoothly, prevention of puzzling incidents, teaching lessons to the mind.

The police station has directed the SHO to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) for the consideration of cases.
Also, DSP has been entrusted with the task of investigating markets, malls and elsewhere, including VIP sectors of the city.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the high officials have also set the duty of additional policemen in the police control in view of the convenience of the people.
Apart from Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH management, including the Director, Principal Director and DHS of Fire Department and PGI, the police asked the staff of other dispensaries to keep high alerts in emergency time.

Bird left back in the forest by air transport for protection from North Sea Rig
The resulting bird on the North Sea oil rig has been left back to the forest from the coast by air transport.
The bird called this water rail was sent to Aberdeen by the helicopter before the Scottish SPCA recovered back to their Eloa-based rescue center.
This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, hit by strong winds over the North Sea," said Center Manager Colin Seden.
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further said: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
The water rail had become healthy and healthy before being released.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with the UK?
The Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring the business together and determine what changes we would like to see in our relationship with the UK’s Employment and Prosperity Maker EU.
For that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they thought about the UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK’s business size, regions and places.
Conclusions of this survey can be amazing for many people.
We found that a large part of businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member countries are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritise new business relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to engage in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the mysterious entities of the EU.
Most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster when asking their views about specific policy areas like monopoly regulation to product law.
The common dissatisfaction over a single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of the regulation of Brussels is far greater than the benefits of being part of Europe's trading sector - even 40 percent of the huge businessmen who traditionally favored European companies agreed on this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants the UK to move on the path of business-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating towards a "meaning change" that would give back its lost power to the UK.
It has a very high price – the issue of treaty changes for the UK and getting a better deal, changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of holding on to the EU, in the collection of votes.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: this survey suggests that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate the UK’s terms of membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect a meaningful change to make the current power balance in favour of the U.K. while reconversing.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly mandatory, as the Eurozone is stepping forward in the direction of the committed economy and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings suggest for businessmen it means a new focus on business and fundamental changes in the regulation methodology of Brussels.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline as the beginning of a new round in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the beginning of the South Stream gas pipeline construction in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe’s largest energy projects.
There has been a historic event today: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe," said Alexei Miller, president of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a core element of energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will provide diversity in Russia’s export routes in Europe.
Officials said that a dispute between Gazprom's counterparty and Gazprom in Ukraine, where Russia's gas is the most part of Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, the "ever-ending" end of gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
After the operation of this entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas at the discounted rates from South Stream.
Construction in other downstream countries should start by the end of the year, Gazprom said.
This pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees accused of sexual crimes before allegations against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission heard
Before being charged against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, two YMCA NSW employees have been subjected to the crime of child sexual crimes.
But in its statement before the commission, it said that it “never revealed a case of child sexual harassment within its organization”, the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which the YMCA Caringbah Jim Instructor was accused of child sexual crimes against the children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare from the Commission-assisted advocate Gail Furnace said he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA’s statement before the Commission that “the YMCA has been externally investigated and found the YMCA to be at the forefront of child protection” is also not accurate.
It is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it obtained the 2nd lowest rating in the four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that management “including me” had failed due to appointing Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of his obligations to report child safety policy violations.
Lord was convicted for sexual crimes with 12 children during a two-year term at the YMCA earlier this year.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare refused the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which employees did not report a child safety violation by Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw about the violation that Lord alone spent time with children, having them personally Babysitting, putting them in their laps, telling them that He loves them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord’s supervision and asked for child protection training because he was worried about his behavior, testified that the YMCA Carringbah child service manager, who supervised Lord, was "very bully and hard to meet Jayby Barnat most of the time."
The CEO said that it did not acknowledge the evidence of employees that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
He said that, rather, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to inform about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW division that, from the "Jonathan Lord event", the text for the organization was "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said that soon after the allegations came out, the decision to get the privacy agreement signed by the employees was made by YMCA’s child service manager Liam Whiteley.
He said that its purpose was to avoid blending of evidence, but it was not “excited” and executed properly.
Children’s sexual abuse special Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during the course of Jonathan Lord’s work between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "severe problems" in the appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed till December 20.
Blair says they want UK comeback
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to become Britain’s Prime Minister again – but they believe there is no possibility of a comeback.
In the interview taken at night on the occasion of his fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister’s Office, Blair, 59, expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr. Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to his role as representative of foreign affairs and peacemakers of the Middle East group.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s post, Mr. Blair was presented by the evening standard newspaper in London saying: “Yes, sure, but this is unlikely to happen, so...”
He urged the leaders not to ignore the merchant community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of experts performing horses for the best horse of the year gathered in Cardiff, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even yet went to school and just a few months away from taking his first step, this little child and his pet Shetland pony Tafyi easily completed three stages and got the top prize - he surpassed his 30 adult rivals.
In the annual competition organized by Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff, the undisputable pair – which is just lengthy – was highly praised for the appearance, behavior, and style of the same.
In front of men and women wearing a beautiful baller hat, she slanted her flat hat at a low angle and made her two-year-old toffee ring dizzy.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural skills to control who is far ahead of his age.
And Toffee got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given to Toffee as a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has since practised with this pony from Shetland daily.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Feton and Toffee are fabulous pairs."
They had faced the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This second opportunity was only when he participated in a competition with Toffee, and we all have great joy in his victory.
Different in this amphitheatre, he all felt so wonderful that he wanted to photograph with him.
This little child from the village of Antiglo, near Ab Well, South Wales, has been walking on the footprints of his aunt Sharon Howells who have been performing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said: "The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was celebrating and clapping."
He was running on sand all over the amphitheatre, and despite looking so small he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is crazy for animals - she loves horses, tractors, and fields, and she has two chickens she takes care of.
The kind of start he has made will be at the best horse exhibition of the very first year – and I trust that he will perform very well.
The annual horse exhibition spokesman said: "Feton is only three years old, but comes to control his pony."
They are a very good pair.
The decision-makers gave points given to Fenton and Toffee's performance patterns and their performance patterns in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Pony and her rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m pretty sure that Fenton’s furry clothes helped her, she really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will have a "revitalization"
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal to the homepage to leave a reporter guilty of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou newspaper New Express had given a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had taken bribes to write the concocted news about the state’s partially owned company.
The regulator said that now New Express has to undergo a "complete improvement".
The order of "correction" came from the Guangdong Press and publishing, radio, film and television administration.
A primary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of false news reports about the listed company Zoomlion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "New Express's editorial management was chaotic."
It said that it had decided to impose an administrative penalty by canceling Chen Yongzhou’s reporter’s license.
It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express and immediately modify the leadership team of the New Express."
Mr. Chen wrote in New Express a number of articles blaming financial irregularities in a construction-tool company called Zoomlion.
After being barred, his newspaper published two homepage appeals for his release, and said he supported Mr. Chen’s journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came to the state television and accepted writing and publishing false stories for money.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV that “In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as its ability to win the entire news industry and the trust of the people.”
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen’s apology, New Express released a homepage apology, stating that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have made a flaw-acceptance broadcast TV.
Experts say that from time to time convictions are made, despite a law in the latter part of this year prohibiting authorities from binding themselves to blame themselves.

He praised the effort of Shri Hindu Nyay Peeth to connect children to Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to give religious education including worldly education to children.
Own railway found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities have described a four-feet-fold three-feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to the crooked length of about six football pitches, which connect the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with warehouses alike, which makes it easy to hide the truck being filled with drugs.
It was already closed before a drug was passed through the tunnel, officials said.
According to the records of the court, officials have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in relation to the search for tunnel.
Three persons, who were told by officials that they were acting as drivers, were accused of keeping marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of delivering.
If they are convicted, they can be punished for 10 years from imprisonment to life imprisonment.

British Police sends extradition notice to Assange
The British police today sent an extradition notice to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge in the embassy of Ecuador in London and requested for shelter.
Scotland Yard said he has sent a " surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he will have to attend the police station, as well as that he himself would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition in Sweden due to sexual crimes charges, as well as his options under British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm will hand them over to the U.S., fearing that he had requested asylum at the embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, telling the South American country for political shelters.
A spokesman said that Scotland Yard has sent a surrender notice to "assange, 40, who required him to appear at the police station on the date and time we chose."
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice being given.
Assange fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face potential espionage charges.
A fine of 1000 pounds (£1,000) to a car-run at a speed of 130 mph with hot drinks between the legs
On the driver, a fine of 1,000 pounds (£1,000) has been fined for driving a car at a speed of 130 mph (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Tiptree, Essex’s 35-year-old Andrew Howie, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a drink on their feet.
Howie has admitted the indictment of driving a car carelessly in the Colchester Magistrate Court.
Seven points were added to their license, as a result of which they have been banned from driving a car for six months.
Hovie was also ordered to pay a fee of 90 pounds (£90) and a suffering surcharge of 100 pounds (£100).
Tax on foreign property owners, will end London’s artificial state
The Finance Department has promulgated the CGT measures, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million pounds in the 2012 budget, and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than a segregated individual.
In 2012/13, the stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was 708 million pounds, already greater than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and Northai East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in stamp duty of high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is less than reasonable tax on a high-value property, which has nothing to do with the effect of the old council tax system.
He added that "but this move was silenced by some foreign investors buying property in London and could make it reluctant to sell to current owners".
The top 5 to 10 percent of the housing market, spread from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8 percent last year, according to the price in the prime property, Dhanadhya South-West London.
According to Savill's research, the prices of central London continued to rise by 5.6 percent each year, but seemed to be slightly lower than the "domestic market", as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) are seen to bounce.
Scientists have further highlighted the relationship between dog tail movements and its mood.
Past researches have shown that happy dogs move their tails more in the right (from dog’s point of view), while restless dogs move their tails more mainly in the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and express their reaction on it.
This study has been published in Journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Georgia Wellertigara from the University of Trento reported: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions in different ways.”
Here we have also tried to see it in other species.
He pointed out that even in dogs like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to one-way swings by other dogs, researchers tracked animals watching other dogs’ movies.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We may not take much time to understand why their enemies sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Prof. Vellertigra explained: "We introduced dogs with dog films - in the shadows to deal with other issues in the realistic version or engaging, and we could see the movement of the tail and present the tail more left or right."
When animals saw an emotionless dog moving their tails to the right (from dog’s point of view), they stayed completely relaxed.
But when he saw the tail changing direction mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view) his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellertigra, they do not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these antics.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience on what they should be concerned about and not on what.
He said: “If you have met other dogs many times, and if they constantly shake their tails aside it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience.”
Researchers say these findings can provide better information about animal sentiments to owners, veterinarians, and trainers.
John Bradshaw, a doctor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences’s Guest Fellow, spoke about whether the left or right part is important for dogs to check if this is the first study.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he explained: "Unlike the Italian study - when the tail of the robot dog was shaken to the left rather than the right, dogs were more likely to get closer to it than to be restless."
He said that the difference was because dogs in various studies were not considering dogs as fully dogs in films.
He clarified that it can help to study how dogs react to real dogs.
While there have been considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be received - and dogs in this case are not exceptions," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we probably won’t take much time to understand why their enemies sometimes shake on one side and sometimes on the other side.
Arctic Monkeys postpones Glasgow Gig due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock bank named Arctic Monkeys has postponed Gig in Glasgow after his lead singer suffered from lynchitis.
On Friday, the program of the Sheffield Group was scheduled to perform at the hydro site in the city.
But his lead singer Alex Turner’s illness forced him to re-determine the date of the show.
The band's announcement came when they were obliged to postpone Gig in the LG Arena in Birmingham in a similar way on Thursday.
In the statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: After the decision to postpone the show at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight after seeking medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 1, Friday.
In the investigation, Alex Turner was found to have been mumped, and he is not sadly able to perform."
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show at Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.

Pope Francis to announce the first cardinal name in February
Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create the new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-class pastors in the Catholic Church, their position is only below the Pope, and these are the people who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will ultimately assist in choosing his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals right now.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the Pope - it falls into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lombardy said that before the ceremony of promoting new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope-Sabha.
Pope Francis has decided to explain his decision to hold the February papal council in advance, so that planning other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world is simplified," Lombardy said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease.
In general, the number of cardinal electors is less than 120, as many cardinals as they are, and declare the name of cardinals over 80 years of age as they wish, he said.
The following year’s gathering will be important, Valero said, as it will be the first gathering after Francis was elected in March this year.
There is currently a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
It would be interesting to see if new popes, from the rest of the world, also nominated cardinals, to restore balance.
There are forty percent of Roman Catholics in South America, but their number in the Cardinals is very low.
Cardinals Council by Francis - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to find ways of reforming the church, will also be the first cardinals to be chosen after being formed.
Before this, the Pope used to decide all things on his own.
Just now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him," Valero said.
He said it is "possible" to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we haven't been in this situation before - it's brand new.
The Pope generally gives the term of Cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis was "completely surprised - so we don't know whose name they would declare."
GM recalls pickup trucks in the U.S. to correct seatbacks
On Friday, General Motors Company called back about 19,000 trucks to correct a lack of hand-rotating seatbacks in its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Seira Pickup trucks, according to an information from U.S. auto safety regulators.
Some trucks may have a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with auto-security standards regarding seatbacks, head restrants.
According to a notification posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head restrant could not protect the driver in a proper way, which will increase the risk of injury".
The recall model was created between August 1 and September 10.
GM’s trucks began to be shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, this is the most important vehicle launch for the top U.S. automaker.
G.M. had told the truck owners about this defect in late October.
The NSTMA could not review the official 16-day detainee, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October, due to the owner’s notification letter.
The GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Seera trucks that were redesigned for the year 2014 model year were up by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM sold 42,660 silverado and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
GM’s share on the New York Stock Exchange jumped 1.4 per cent on Friday afternoon.
The Humiliation of Obama's Voters
I voted to Obama twice in anticipation of the change
Obama’s great efforts have been disrupted due to GOP’s barrier policy, he says.
Obamacare Website Troubles Can't Excuse Drone Attacks
The 2008 campaign memoir of Obama reminds of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book I think this second year will add to my excitement during the depression of medical school and a ray of hope in me.
It is named “the courage to win”, and it is Barack Obama’s confederation of the 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I am able to hang out at night with my patients and go to bed, this book takes me to a period in which politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
Elections proved to be one side, and news speakers took a break to reflect the historical importance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newsletter they received.
A team of young visionaries was going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an 82 percent approval rating while Obama became President in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, as if returning from the world of dreams.
Those days of hope are hard to remember - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
I actually changed after the first time I voted.
To put it simply, none of it could have imagined.
I credit Obama with a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, to the end of “Don’t Ask” Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposing bias has prevented a lot of efforts to advance our country: including immigrant reform, public option for healthcare, closure of haunt on Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But in the innumerable times in which I myself side with the Obama administration in front of colleagues and peers to end the answer I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disappointment.
Republicans’ opposition policy is not the answer to foreign leaders’ espionage, nor the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency’s collection of data about the personal lives of ordinary U.S. citizens, nor can it respond to prosecutions against those who expose the wrong doings of the government.
It cannot explain the reason for the murder of Anwar El Avalaki, a U.S. citizen without any trial, nor the diminishing public funds and expenditure limits during the President’s Campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that attempts by the White House to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration until now."
And most recently, it cannot give an excuse for the failure to design a simple website even after three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don’t know if I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the governance system could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
The direct is that the elected office is not a predictable route, as the opposing political party and random events such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public discussion.
Yet the number of examples I have given above seem mostly to have been chosen by the administration.
This is the most disturbing thing to you.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidacy.
Mitt Romani presented a confusing and uncertain option, which seemed not like determining their policies or their position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hopes we have been listening to for a long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama’s approval rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return to the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I miss his disappeared promises.
A part of the book was reading this week, which described how Clinton suffered a huge loss due to Obama in Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they need to return to the track, and remain honest on their objectives.
He said "I want to get my mojo back".
We should remember who we are.”
Today, after five years, I cannot agree with you even more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that PM Tony Abbott's interest in parental leave planning is conflict
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in parental leave planning is conflict as his daughters can become pregnant, and take advantage of it.
The Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in controversy over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, claimed while attempting to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be crucial in determining how carbon and mining taxes are reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and that Mr. Abbott’s daughters can personally benefit from policies.
He may have an important interest conflict in the case of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest in whether they get discharged or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner of Fairfax’s Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after the fall again.
Mr. Palmer sought the revival of election counting to advance the process at a faster pace.
Tony Aaut's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should the outcome of the election come two months after we voted?
We should have a better system,” he said.
Why it may not be that we have a system in which we fill in our details on the computer, vote instantly and in the evening we have the result at 6:30.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
This is because if a person does not like it, they can erase it.
In today’s era, it seems absolutely absurd to use pencils.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently released a Joint Discussion Paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included being built an international airport for Sunshine Coast, and they took their new work "very seriously".
Public post is for public service.
We need no other awards but history awards that we can serve the community at this crucial time," he added.
Due to which the plaintiffs had to suffer.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed intense resentment over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said, the rapidly growing attacks on advocates and their families prove that criminals have become unconscious.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents that took place in different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the security of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, the case that the science received this information from two people, it is another sign that global investigations by regulators in the suspicious manipulation of the currency market are moving forward at a fast pace.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators in an investigation into the world’s largest financial market in which $5.3 trillion is exchanged each day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, suspended with further investigations into the seemingly recurring case of the LIBOR interbank debt manipulation scandal.
The bank has refused to comment on suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, “Our investigation into this matter continues, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators.”
Last month, experts from the case had said that RBS has sent records of emails and instant messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, named Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from its current position as the European head of forex spot trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in the city, went on holiday last week, while former senior currency traders in Barclays and UBS were suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Experts from the case pointed out that Mr. Usher’s instant messaging group included Barclay and Citigroup’s bankers.
UBS said that, after the Swiss regulator, Finma pointed out that she was investigating suspicious manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a lot of Swiss banks, this week she has taken action against some of her employees.
At least six authorities globally – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s Competition Authority VECO, the Department of Justice in the FCA, the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations of bankers being made abusing their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
People familiar with the matter reported that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information on behalf of regulators.
Banks are closely examining instant messages and emails equivalent to several years looking for clues to a wrong activity.
The news about the investigation has created a panic among traders in the region who have been among the most profitable individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as opportunities for bettors have come down due to low fluctuations in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the enormous volume of foreign exchange buying and selling, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increased use of its own platform by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
This news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that the trader should be serviced this week from his Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London, which had made a loss of about $6 million at the end of the previous year.
The bank immediately notified coherent authorities and is collaborating with its regulators.
We believe that the trader worked alone, and that he has been controlled," Credit Suisse said.
Students studying other courses including campus technical and management will be able to use their franchise this time.
The University Vice Chancellor has written a letter to the Governor for permission to hold elections.
With the commencement of the admission process at the university, there was a demand for the students’ union to conduct elections.
He also conducted a signature campaign regarding the selection of his representative to give his voice to the university administration and college management.
Students pursuing nearly two dozen courses, including campus-run BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, will be able to choose their representative this year.
More than six thousand students studying here will get a chance to use the franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Prof. Ashok Kumar informed that permission has been sought from the Governor to hold elections at the university.
The election date will be declared as soon as the permission is received.
It is the responsibility of college management to conduct elections in other colleges, he said.
Many college management don’t want students’ union elections to be held on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity in the students, elections are also not being made.
The council had launched a signature campaign for elections.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Convener ABVP
After Deepawali, the district administration will be asked for permission to hold elections in colleges.
There are also problems with the lack of clearing the view of colleges regarding the student association elections.
People have made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from utensils in the capital on Dhanteras.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the previous year.
In Shimla, the shops of jewellery were busy with people.
A lot of crowd was also seen in the utensils shops that decorated from the lower market to Mal Road.
Although inflation was gaining on such items this year, people still did not show confusion in shopping at the auspicious time.
On Friday, the auspicious Muhurta remained for purchase from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and from 1:56 to 3:37 am and from 6:17 am to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the said three Muhurtas, more crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla gathered for more shopping.
In the Shimla Lower market, people did not find a place to sit.
In this way, crowds were also engaged in every small and big shop.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras celebrated as Dhantrayodashi, the Trayodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, there are signs of auspicious Diwali.
Supreme Court upholds Obama Health Service Law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges decided that it was constitutional under the power of the government to levy tax, in favour of separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act – under which citizens would need to buy or punish health insurance before 2014.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other judges Scalia, Thos, Elito, and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court has also supported the remaining paragraphs of this law containing 2700 pages, and stated that the condition of the healthcare law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or that they will lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally oppressive.
The petition was brought by 26 states, and the National Independent Business Federation to prevent this law.
During the early 2012 session this law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including the hypothetical nominee Mit Romney.
It is right that without money, our work cannot be done.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to assume it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshiped as Kubera, the god of wealth and Yamraj, the death god.
Wealth is an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
It is very bad and we have a feeling of money.
There cannot be anything more valuable than what is used for the welfare of humanity, but the wealth that causes arrogance has no meaning.
We earn money for the holy purpose and spend it for the holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Some part of this should also have a feeling of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collection or yen-ken-type money destroys our conscience, personality.
The spirit of charity should always remain in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also become the basis of one’s living.
Many people in society are living in a terrible absence for them, we all should think.
In fact, meaning, religion, work, and salvation have been given equal importance in the purushathras of life.
All people wish for wealth and fame, and according to their efforts, they also receive wealth and fame.
The same wealth is durable with which respect is associated.
No matter how wealthy a criminal may become, he can neither consume it properly nor come to the aid of anyone else.
If someone else has money, don’t be jealous of him.
The true rich man is the one who makes a way to flow into the myriad hands of wealth.
There can be no more good use of money than the creation of employment for others.
One more thing, money is not only as a currency.
It also happens as a love for your health, character, and others.
Try to be the master of this wealth.

Departmental officials say that it’s been a year for students entering 2012, that’s why it’s important to seek legal advice in this matter.
The officials of the Medical Education Department are not in a position to say anything due to the fact that the matter is currently confined to the investigation of STF.
Tarun Pithorae, the Vyapaman operator, says that if the STF assigns a list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be immediately revoked.
On the other hand, Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava, Director Medical Education, informed that students have not even refused to cancel their admissions if found to be fake admissions.
According to the STF officials, fake students included in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of questionable students will be assigned to Vyapam.
It is noteworthy that Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students involved in the PMT exam held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the Department of Medical Education has so far revoked 84 admissions.
Aijaz Jaan, MLA from Poonch assembly constituency, inaugurated the water cooler at Gurudwara campus.

After the general election, if the new government continued its policy of discontinuing the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states, kerosene will not be available at these shops.
States where kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, in some states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Northeast, there is also a preparation to discontinue the sale of kerosene.
According to sources of the Petroleum Ministry, it will be decided to discontinue the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states on two basis.
First base, lightning connection is being built in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, in the states where most of the rural households have been given LPG connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum has prepared a lot about this.
PDS Kerosene sales in Delhi have already closed since October 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota has been reduced significantly to Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand.
Punjab’s quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo litres to one lakh kilo litres.
In the allocation of Uttarakhand, 70 percent of the kerosene quota of Haryana was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, there has not been news of the shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel at this time has a difference of Rs 37.
This promotes adulterers.
Oil companies will sell kerosene at full cost in the open market in the states where sales will be closed through PDS.
At this time, oil companies are suffering losses of more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
In the year 2013-14, the burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crores.
The accused used to forgery in the name of buying and selling shares by opening an account of investors by referring to the trading firm.
Perhaps the first such revelation in the state has revealed the fraud of crores of rupees.
At present, the police have not been able to reach him, but seven people, including the accused who saw his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
This gang operated a fake commodity market called Metatrader-5.
The company’s borrowers used to make fake IDs on a fake software by taking cash from investors.
This used to show investors’ bought shares of the accused when they traded.
It even knew at what price the stock was bought.
In fact, no shares were bought and there was no transaction for this, because no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown falsely on this fake software.
The police are guessing that hundreds of people have come in the guise of this gang.
Every investor was made to invest two to five lakh rupees in the name of giving profits.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while six of her other companions have been caught from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dual, it is important to connect any stock trading company with the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company get investors share trading through it.
Then the investor’s demat account is opened, so that shares can be bought and sold for it, but this company named Metatrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did stock trading.
This company purchased the server for itself by referring to trading in the name of Wintrade on September 24, 2012.
Since then, people have been bluffed at the name of investing through this company.
Eight traders from Indore have been reported for the time being complaining in the cyber cell.
Even after selling their purchased shares in profits, their money did not transfer to the account.
On this, he started asking for the amount of profit from the company’s workers.
Investors are even saying that the price of their purchased shares was always shown lower on the fake ID given to them.
This price accused used to decide on their level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agent in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
The agents advised people to connect with this company by greeding for more profits.
After this, two lakhs were deposited from someone to someone up to five lakh rupees.

Narendra Modi, the prime ministerial candidate of the BJP who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar hospital, on Friday launched intense attacks on the Congress while addressing an election meeting.
Modi said on the occasion, "There was a coalition government in many states and centres in the country, sometimes the Congress government, sometimes the government of the communists and sometimes the BJP government.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What did the party do?
If this results in a comparative outcome, then the question will not come to the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
When the BJP government has been formed, there has been an effort to fulfil the people’s aspirations.
This country is witness to Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai’s inflation was low in the government.
The poor man used to get food for two times.
But when a government with Congress or its support was formed, the poor man was not able to eat a lot.
Not a single Congress leader is responding to what even a single UPA leader did in nine and a half years.
Even those of the media of our country are not able to reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They also do not respond to media persons.
The elections are from the Lok Sabha, you reply to the public.
In 2014, when the people bless the BJP, every year they will submit their work account to the public," Modi said.
In democracy, no ruler or servant should sit in Delhi.
There cannot be any Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves there.
Congressmen continue to leave balloons on the day they arrive.
We have already given the exam for 10 months.
In democracy, the public takes the test.
In the case of Nortel Patent, the economic lawsuit is filed on Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, owned by thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed several patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, which it had overtaken in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The association called Rockstar that bought Nortel Patents for 4.5 billion has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawai, and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said that these patents also include technology that matches the terms searched on the Internet with consistent advertising, which is the core part of Google’s search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted instantly.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is closely related to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel Patents.
Google finally proposed $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel Patents, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons Motorola had to have a long list of patents.
Despite losing in an attempt to acquire a patent-in-suit in the auction, Google has violated, and is constantly infringing," the indictment said.
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it claims that patent infringement by Google is a misrepresentation.
Believed in the first President chosen independently in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has taken oath of his office, but his victory day hardly ended the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammad Morsi, who replaced Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago, promised "new Egypt" when he took oath of office as the first independently elected president of the country.
On his formal inductance before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab has become the first Islamist president of the world independently elected, and the fifth president of Egypt after the monarchy was removed about 60 years ago.
He took oath on his chair on the side of the Nile River in front of the 18 judges who had black robes of the court, which resembled the ancient Egyptian temple.
During the ceremonial ceremony shown in live broadcasts on national television, Morsi said that "we are aspiring for a better future, new Egypt and another republic."
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, who has spent 84 years as an unlawfully declared organization since its inception, and who has been on the target of previous governments, the party’s engineer 60-year-old Morsi, trained in the U.S., said that “Today the Egyptians have laid the foundation for new life – complete independence, true democracy and stability.”
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building and came to Morsi in the small convoy of cars after 11 a.m. local time.
From the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to give Mubarakabad to the new president apart from the President’s pomp, the traffic was also stopped for a while, so that his motor convoy would normally leave the busy road connecting the city centre to its south suburbs.
Morsi’s personal reputation as a non-charismatic “empty tire” of Brotherhood rose greatly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him not only to Islamist but as a candidate of all who wish to complete the task of the 2011 Revolution against dictatorship Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that Morsi moved to Cairo University, where he had to give his opening speech.
They were officially welcomed by the military band by playing national melodies, while they stood in the currency of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan “Army and people are a hand”.
Established in the year 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became the bastion of Islamist student groups in the years 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took the symbolic oath in Tahrir Squire, the cradle of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s dictatorship last year, and took the oath to withdraw the presidential powers taken from his post by the military council from the leader removed last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court rather than customarily taking the competent oath of Parliament, they bowed before the will of the military, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech at Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

External Affairs Minister John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases U.S. espionage has surpassed the extent.
At the same time, he claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance program.
This acceptance by Kerry came out while addressing the Open Government Partnership’s annual summit held in London through video links.
Kerry said that I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to gain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill limiting the monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
Its purpose is to make the surveillance more transparent and restore the trust in people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tape.
The Senate move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also put a dent in the data centres of these companies.
The Senate’s Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Monitoring Reforms Bill [FISA], which clipped over the NSA, by 4 votes, against 11.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including banning one-time phone tape under the U.S. Patriot Act.
By knowingly collecting data unauthorizedly under the FISA, its use will be considered a crime and a provision has been made for ten years of prison punishment.
This bill will become a law after the two Houses of Congress are passed in the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Chairman and Senator Diane Festin said the NSA phone recording program is under law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the country’s security.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in.
At the same time, the protection of the privacy of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL, and Facebook have supported this bill, annoyed by the NSA’s internet monitoring program being disclosed.
In the letter to senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs who curb the large-scale phone recording of NSA.
It is worth mentioning that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the NSA’s deeds.
There is a significant displeasure in the international community after the NSA revealed a telephonic surveillance of heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

Managing Director Graham Turner said that Flight Centre has made an 8 per cent profit in the first half, and started well in its second half, especially in Australia and the UK in non-commercial travel.

A recent media report said the NSA flew information from Yahoo and Google’s data centers for spying.
Washington Post has revealed this based on documents raised from former NSA Contractor Edward Snowdon.
According to the report, the NSA’s program was named-muscular, which it teamed up with its British counter part-GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data passing through the vast fiber optic cable networks laid by Yahoo and Google.
Washington Post, quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, saying that more than 18 crore documents were raised in just three days after the programme was launched.
These also include email, text, audio, and video messages.
According to the Washington Post-the program was run out of the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA access to this information.
Running this program outside the US was easier for the NSA, as such campaigns in the US must have court orders, according to the newspaper.
The NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington – as far as my information is concerned, it never happened.
The NSA has always mobilized all the information within the purview of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted at spying the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said Wednesday that the U.S. administration has assured that its communication system is not monitored.

Schools urged to focus more on Mathematics, Spelling and Grammar
In English literature, students must read at least a Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen text" to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and there will be a lot of induction to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release the new syllabus for English and Mathematics tomorrow – both of these will be the first subjects in which there will be a revolutionary change.
It will also change the second main topics in the following year.
In a separate step, the examination will demonstrate the changes in the composition of GCSE with regulatory off-compliant, new grading system, and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Secretary of Education Michael Gov said that “there was a lot of consensus about this that, in order to restore the trust of the people we need to improve our examination system” He said that “GCSE will be “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours a week less during the session than in most countries.
Australian schools offer students an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal need to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that extensive mathematics was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools from being combined with topics in the GCSE - League table for overweight.
This course will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.

At the rail gate, surrounded by opposition’s questions, Pawan Bansal put the opposition in one place by saying that he did not look at anyone’s woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the matter of the woman came from in the middle.
Perhaps Bansal’s gesture was on the side of a big BJP leader and a councilor’s domestic relations.
After this, while turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had plotted to complain to a woman who could not succeed during the last parliamentary election by putting a woman behind her.
In a conversation with journalists, Bansal said that CBI has questioned them in a rail bribe.
Will they be made only after thorough investigation if they were made witnesses in the case?
Bansal said that he had written a letter only for a needy person in the booth scam that he was talking about.
If this is their sin, then they will always commit such sin.

He said that as far as the development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.

It may be recalled that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to honour the workers in the Chintan camp and protect them from alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he was also speaking that he was ready to dismiss from the cabinet to keep his point.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the Chintan camp, there is a possibility of renewed thought in terms of sitting workers in government posts.
In the camp, JD(U) President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers will be announced soon in 20-point committees.
Their indication was also that the list was almost ready.
The news is coming that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will check the list from his own level.
They will also examine whether the MLAs-MPs have been taken into account in making the list.
If the need arises, the list will be extensively shuffled to give place to old and committed workers.
The general allegation of MLAs and MPs is that they were not taken to make a list of nominations.
The names of people from other parties too later have been recorded in the list while many important activists active since the days of Samata Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such name also comes from self-Dhirubhai Ambani.
Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani’s third son, Dhirubhai Ambani, a teacher in a small village in Gujarat at a school in Chorwad, was born on 28 December 1932.
Of the five siblings, Dhirubhai was third in number.
The family’s five children include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochan and Jasumathi.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to quit studying only after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house financially in his childhood.
At this time they used to put a shop of Bhajiya near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited on the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai’s first job, he arrived in Eden, Yemen, in 1949, at the age of 17, by a ship called Cabota.
Here, his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in the mind of Dhirubhai.
So in 1954 they returned to the homeland.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try his luck by keeping 500 rupees in his pocket.
And that’s where their business journey started.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani departed the world on 6 July 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
At present, his son Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his Sultanate.
Like the father, today the name of these two brothers is also among the international level businessmen.
Who doesn’t know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquid used to kill mosquitoes.
The tax-enhancing proposal will soon be placed before the cabinet.
The government battling the financial crisis is looking for every possible way to increase earnings these days.
It is worth mentioning that the resource committee under the chairmanship of Minister of Urban Development Mohammad Azam Khan remains to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, out of the many tax-enhancing proposals at the recently held resource committee meeting, the committee rejected those who had a direct impact on the implementation.
However, the committee has given a green signal to the proposal to increase tax on mosquito-killing repellents, quails, mats and liquid.
It is proposed to triple the tax on these.
At present, four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax on these.

Similarly, the committee has not given a green signal to increase tax on transmission wire etc. electrical goods at the moment that it can affect the general public to make electricity expensive.
The committee has also not considered a proposal to levy green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

The security of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who joined the Congress from the People’s Democratic Party, has been allegedly removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for saying that their security had been removed for political reasons.
It may be recalled that Ghulam Hasan Khan Mufti Mufti Muhammad Saeed, who won the elections in the year 2002 on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was included in his cabinet.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have got a protective shield since 1996.
I live in shopies called strongholds of terrorists.
A security squad of CRPF at my home was deployed under the leadership of Sub Inspector.
There are bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security shaft was going from my home I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and District SP.
But instead of restoring the security, he just said he would investigate the matter.
However, in this context, when IGP Abdul Ghani Mir of Kashmir was contacted, he denied the information about the matter, saying that this is a sensitive matter.
I myself will examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Souz told me that there is nothing like this in my information.
This is a very serious thing if Hassan Khan’s security has been compromised.
I am in Jammu at this time coming to Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Instead of Modi’s claims, no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002) during Atal Vihari Bajpai’s PM’s reign (between 1999 and 2004).
Keeping the cornerstone of Sardar Patel’s 182m tall ‘Statue of Unity’ statue in Kevadiya, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, “There was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel’s birth anniversary before this.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel’s advertisements.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari was asked about Modi’s claims, he said that BJP’s PM candidates do not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA did not bring any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel’s advertisements is significantly less than the amount spent on the birth anniversarys and death dates of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
The DAVP spent 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary and death anniversary, 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print advertisements.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about this difference, he said, “It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.
Because the price of the ad depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it reveals our dedication, people who are opposed to trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today he will meet families of those killed in Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the bang, hard security has been arrested on all sides in view of Narendra Modi’s visit to Patna again.

Modi’s security circle will be further tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also started on BJP’s Bone Urn Yatra, which has been taken over by people killed in Patna blasts.
Chief Minister of the state Nitish Kumar alleges that BJP is engaged in disturbing the atmosphere.
Free Proceed through the soil, rivers and forest to provide medical service
Dr. Georges Welle is delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team sees hundreds of patients on almost every weekend
West African countries do not have too many doctors; there is only one doctor for 5000 people.
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Vell is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in the other top 10 to make CNN a hero of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue their exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his sick father come to consciousness and fainting, going to the hospital, who were not properly facilitated to help him.
Jammel Well was injured in a car accident near the capital of Cameroon, Yoonde, in the year 1981.
Initially, they had only broken their hands, but an infection increased that spread to their brains, and they produced a bloody build that affected the rest of their lives.
There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon,” says Georges Well.
If we had money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well kept circling highly crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and receiving whatever treatment he could have.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. hoping that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but this does not happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can get into the mouth of death while waiting.
The situation did not change much since the death of Well’s father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician for every 5000 persons.
If compared, there is one doctor for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two thirds of the expenditure incurred in healthcare in the country is of the private sector.
Their only problem is poverty,” says Well.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well resolved to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have done 700 free surgery last year.
He himself became a physician, and began working as a Vascular Surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yonda.
And he launched the non-profit organization Esquoim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the terrace and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not with them either.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
The free medical service in these villages is really the reason to celebrate, and Well – with its big smile and endless energy – includes joyously.
The next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
We are meeting 500 people on each journey," said Well.
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses, or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
The operations are usually done at the school building, town hall, or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery place, and makes room for the next person.
The group’s generator publishes in-room and sanitizing devices with operations, and Vell and his volunteer Sundays wake up early in the morning.
It’s waist-breaking speed, but the village’s musicians usually assist in keeping the crew motivated.
They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work,” Well said.
On Sunday their crew returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group – including Cameron’s physician and foreign medical students – has done 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their assistance can change the world of people they help.
A person told that he will be able to go to work again due to the receipt of free hernia surgery.
The man said, “This will change the future of me and my family.”
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Well also works at a private medical clinic around Yonda at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
I don't know when they sleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in the group of Well.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep on running these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the campaign of Well have this practical opportunity, which they can never get into their country.
We have been able to gain hands-on experience in the surgery we assist in holding tools for Dr. Well or clearing blood stains," said O'Malley.
You will never have the opportunity to do so as a second-year medical student in the US.
Volunteer students typically spend from their near to arrive in Cameroon, and they often come with medical supplies of donations.
But after reaching the tour, they take care of their living and going, and the expenditure of instructions is well.
No doubt they are heroes,” says O’Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, there is almost the same workload, not difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
I am very happy when doing this work,” says Well.
And I think about my father.
I hope they are seeing what I am doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.
Check the website of Esquoim and find out how to help.
You won't be sure it's true.
Not only this, the name of Mission Road has been named after Nagar Parishad President Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named it to express its displeasure over some of the city’s bad roads.
The event was led by the Union Secretary of JMM, Sachchidanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, “You look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they don’t talk about what they have done.”
The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not respond to media questions," he said.
Manmohan Singh is Prime Minister and his government is there, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to respond to the public.
Clearly, Modi was replying to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wanted to have an atmosphere of control where he gave his speech and did not speak to him to avoid questions from journalists.
Sibal also challenged Modi to argue face to face.
I promise to the people of the country that when the BJP government is formed in 2014, we will present the report to the people each year," Modi said.
Congress has again given tickets to all the old MLAs.

Obama's healthcare proposal was withdrawn
In the midst of a barrage of criticism, President Obama withdrew his often repeated misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue to like your health plan if you like it."
With millions receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent times.
Tomorrow Obama made changes to his true message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance and are useful can continue it."
Addressing what he called the "slat of news" about the cancellation, Obama has graciously urged U.S. citizens receiving these information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, the same amount of money or a comprehensive healthcare plan cheaply from the proposed one.
You will get a better deal," he said.
The administration has said that there should be no wonder that 5 percent of the population that buys insurance with their own money may be obliged to change their plans as their coverage does not conform to the standards desired under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said that "I tell these U.S. citizens directly" you deserve better.
Sebelius, who has been taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market has been "unfortunately" since October.
He said that “I am as disappointed and angry as other people.”
I want to gain your faith again.
After a tussle with the Republicans, a fellow sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday, said this sentence in anger, caught by a Mike. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act, has not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.

Since the Election Code of Conduct came into force on October 4, 313 cases were registered against various political parties till October 21.
At the same time, only 31 cases have been registered from October 22 to 27.
Along with the implementation of the election code of conduct, cases of its violation also started coming.
There was more complaints coming in the early days, but gradually it has started to decrease.
It is being told that more complaints were coming against political parties due to lack of complete information about the code of conduct in the early days.
There are now fewer complaints coming from the Election Commission for making political parties aware and taking lessons from the registered matter.

Political parties are following the election code of conduct with information on it.
This is also reducing cases of its violation.
In this regard, a proposal has been sent to the government from the ADA, which is going to be stamped soon.

In unintended confession John Kerry said that U.S. espionage has "unsuitablely gone too far ahead"
John Carey, by unexpectedly acknowledging that the U.S.’s protective attitude on his surveillance program, has hinted to softening that sometimes its spying goes "unsuitable too far forward."
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is also guilty with Barack Obama in the case of being on “automated pilot” as an insurgent disclosure towards the informer Edward Snowden about NSA’s espionage activities unfolding.
This mystification has brought diplomatic groundwork to the U.S. government in connection with its allies.
Speaking through the video link at the free government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, I, and others in the government were really aware of a few things to happen with the automatic pilot, because back then the World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, had its potential in 9/11.
They have become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to acknowledge that U.S. espionage has overridden its limits, but insisted that no one’s rights were misused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone far ahead inappropriately.”
And the president is determined to try to make this clear for the people and is doing thorough reviews right now so that no person has a sense of abuse.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that, however, the NSA was striving for good purpose, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up," he added.
In the world there is radical extremism, which is committed to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
So what if you are able to prevent it before it happens?
We’ve actually saved the plane from falling, demolishing buildings, and killing people because we’ve been able to learn about others’ plans in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the president of the Senate Subcommittee of European Affairs said that the U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help address the concern abroad about the so-called U.S. espionage, and try to explain the need for European countries to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said he spoke to European Parliament members and others this week and was concerned about the threats of his involvement in counter-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
It is really important for U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our counterterrorism efforts," said Murphy, first elected by the Democrats party and president of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee of European Affairs, Washington.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
News of NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe has brought bitterness in connection with some of the U.S. allies, although the agency’s head said that these news are not entirely correct, and shows the misunderstanding of metadata that NATO associate nations share with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that NSA has monitored cellphones from 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkle.
National intelligence director James Clapper defended the spying incident on allies and called it necessary and said that it is common for both parties to do so.
In the middle of the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress visit which is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said that the itinerary is still being worked on.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relationships, he said that some "impractical relationships" would also have to be discarded.
He said that European leaders would have to be honest with their people, even with their spy programs used for years.
Although we can modify our monitoring program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this weekend, Mr. Carey has a program to go to Middle East and Poland, where he will solve hesitancy from the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt, and Iran to U.S. surveillance activities.
New politics of board change has started in municipalities.
Recently, Trinamool was converted to the board due to the change of the board councillors of Congress leadership in the Santhiya municipality of Veerbhum district.
This change took place due to the involvement of most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, in the TMC.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of CPI, CPI and FORWARD BLOCK have also held the repression of TMC here.
Trinamool Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai considers it an auspicious sign for the party.
He says that Virendra Parikh, chairman of the Santhiya municipality, and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Congress’ 10 councilors’ trinamool.
Some of the Left councillors, including the CPI, have also held the Trinamool flag.
Everyone has written to the district magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the TMC and according to the number force, the Santhiya municipal board has also come under the control of TMC.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint for Bengal’s development under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders from other parties including Congress, CPI(M), CPI(M), and Forward Block are moving forward to join Trinamool Congress.
The worthy leaders of any party are welcome in the TMC.
Trinamool’s capture of the Palika Board is considered important in political circles due to the change of the party of Congress councillors in the Santhiya municipality before the election of five municipalities to be held on November 22.
Earlier, the Left Front-ruled Haldia and the River are also examples of Trinamool’s capture of the Congress-ruled Palika Board.
When the trinamool is occupied by the party due to the change of party on the municipal board in the districts, the party who joins the trinamool building in Kolkata has a grand welcome.
Trinamool Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai is excited about breaking down from other parties and joining the TMC leaders.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claims that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, which is the result that people want to join the TMC.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) says lower-level leaders of other parties are being threatened.
People are joining him by fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is regarded as a shock on the CPI-M democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its mass base but it is necessary to question the justification of changing the vote in the item of power.
Australian woman appeals against the Thai confinement period
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket to falsely accuse a taxi driver, she has appealed against this decision and has got bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Steve Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations over the Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver had tried to stop him in the morning of Sunday June 10 along with two other persons.
But later CCTV footage showed that she had safely returned to the hotel after being separated from her Australian boy friend.
Phuket accepted to fabricate the story when police questioned Bamfort for two days.
He was placed in the local police cell before hearing in the court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment at a low-security detention center in the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women prison.
He is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunx, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunx told the Sunday telegraph of Sydney that the whole family is “highly concerned” about their daughter’s care and that they want to call her back to Australia.
Of course it has been a worrisome time for us, but we hope it will be back at home as soon as possible," Tuns said.
BAMFOOD has appealed against the penalty order, and got bail on 50,000 beh.
During this time, the report in Australia said that it was celebrating holidays at the Krabi holiday place in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said that Bamford's case was being fought by a local advocate in Phuket, but warned that the Court could increase his penal order to two years as a result of the appeal and force him to stay in adult prison.
By the way, after the assassination of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket recently, Thailand can also give defection in an effort to improve its poor tourist image.
