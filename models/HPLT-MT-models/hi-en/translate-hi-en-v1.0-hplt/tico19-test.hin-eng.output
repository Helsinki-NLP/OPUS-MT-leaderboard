The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing the same trend in EU/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries at various stages depending on the country.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for rapid growth in patients with COVID-19 who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases with unknown pathology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China informed Novel Coronavirus, now referred to as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, evidence is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, that is, respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these are cured.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops as a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% cases there is an overview of critical illness requiring serious care.
The death rate of patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it with its Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK to Italy during January 31, 15 March 2020.
EU/EEA countries and UK COVID-19 cases
After China, the further geographical expansion of COVID-19 took place and currently the COVID-19 pandemic’s activity in the rest of the world went beyond this country.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 edition of Eurosurvalence 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France in those returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, on 24 Jan 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, all 30 cases of COVID-19 were found in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases only from Italy and 1,441 deaths with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and that date.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, the National and Regional Health Authority, and the number of COVID-19 cases reported from each country of the world received from WHO are updated at 8:00 a.m. every day.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease that occurred in Italy.
As representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we thus calculated a brief cumulative prevalence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural process of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period January 1 – March 15, 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country from 15 March 2020 until 8:00 AM as compared to Italy in the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
The trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14-day brief cumulative prevalence trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Fig. 1).
Throughout the EU/EEA and the UK, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 began to grow around February 21st and grew rapidly around February 28th 2020 (supplementary content).
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK witnessed a similar growing trend (supplementary content).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases compared to the EU/EEA countries and Italy in the UK during the period 31 January – 15 March 2020.
This specifically shows that by 15 March 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported the total number of comparable cases from Italy cases only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trend seen in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing with comparative momentum across countries.
This is despite the various phases of the countries, variations in national public health responses, and possible different case definitions in countries and different protocols for patients to choose from, which must be necessarily examined for confirmation of COVID-19, including having a hold-check.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy reported a condition in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources informed that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 cases being admitted to the hospital and/or intensive care unit are currently only available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (stats not shown).
They must however be collected in a methodical manner to supplement current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
The study in 2010-11 saw a huge difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
• The prevalence of 90% risk-related hospitalization COVID-19 cases is provided in the sixth update of ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19 impersonation of conditions related to health care capacity saturation with estimates for every EU/EEA country and the UK.
Since cases so far remain in flocks in certain EU/EEA countries and UK regions and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve the defined regional public, information about cases and intensive care beds should primarily be made available at the Nomenclature of Territorial Unit for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience gained from Italy and the current trend in other countries shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need continuous community transmission status of SARS-CoV-2 and health care, especially intensive care as it is taking place in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, with the mitigation outlook changing, slowing down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires a sharp, forward-looking and comprehensive approach, as if not implemented in time, the number of cases may not provide the anticipated rapid growth decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt to their response accordingly.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have very few opportunities to further increase their control efforts and reduce pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is highly likely that other EU/EEA countries’ health care arrangements face rapid growth in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
More than 3,000 people have died so far due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 and more than 80,000 other people in China and the world have been infected, resulting in disaster for humans.
Like its homogeneous virus SARS-CoV, which led to SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and produces similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, there is a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS in COVID-19, but is much more transmissive and affects men than elderly people and women than young people.
In response to the number of rapidly growing publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide topical and comprehensive reviews on the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics on Epidemiology, For-Science, Virology, Diagnosis, Treatment, Forecasting and Prevention of Disease.
Although there are still a lot of questions to find answers, we hope that this review will help understand and eradicate fatal disease.
The spring festival on January 25, 2020, due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, has become an unexpected and forgetful memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay at home for the whole holiday and many weeks thereafter.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of ultra-intense respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started from Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to almost 50 other countries across the country and the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported with a discharge from the hospital of more than 40,000 patients and death of more than 3,000 patients due to the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is “the enemy number 1 of the public” and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, for-science, diagnosis, and treatment, set a sequence of viruses separated from many patients.
This review seeks to summarize research progress on the new and rapidly evolving subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding disease prevention and forecasting as well as some of the other essential questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens for humans with around 15% of the common cold 4 producing colds.
However, in this century we have faced highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible unfaithfulness and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in the figure 1,1, a bunch of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first informed to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The sequence of CoV was released seven days later.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 Jan 2020.
During this time, the pandemic rapidly spread to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, an infection was reported in health care providers, which indicated that human transmission from human beings was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was lockdowned with all its public traffic closed.
On January 24, the first clinical study on disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to about 50 other countries across China and the world (Figure 2).2).
Since the situation is growing rapidly, the final prevalence and intensity of the outbreak are yet to be determined.
The multi-central study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, on 11 Feb 2020 featured a more up-to-date epidemiology (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons were more than 50 years of age, much less than 20 years and only 14 infected persons were less than 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 mainly spread over flocks in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to extensive traffic before the spring festival in China.
Patients with confirmed cases had a mortality rate of 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and all patients had an adjusted mortality rate of 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors of COVID-19 were gender (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs is a subfamily of RNA’s single-fighting large and enveloping viruses.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoV are known as infecting human beings.
Casing nozzle (S) connects with its cell propagating angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) respectively in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and then merges the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the casing forms RNA virion vesicles with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are later merged into the plasma membrane for the discharge of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV, with over 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 indexed samples collected from Wuhan’s Huanan seafood market, the original location of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the extremely fine segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2, along with SARS-CoV-2, was found to be achievable for SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 connects to human ACE2 with a greater weakness than SARS-CoV which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2, in patients, produces less serious infections than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2, coded by orf3b, can also make novel short proteins and secreted proteins coded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 can play a role in orf3b viral pathology and block the expression of IFNβ; however orf8 does not have any known functional domains or motifs.
On 18 Feb 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in a mixture with amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could add two S proteins that provide evidence for the identification and infection of the CoV.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic goal for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and Intermediate Nutrients
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by the civet cat and camel, respectively.
By the genetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, Bats were considered to be the basic nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrients helped in infecting the human by crossing the virus species barrier is unknown and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans that included the same recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolin - often long muzzle used in traditional Chinese medicine, ant-eating mammals SARS-CoV-2 and CoV found in Pangolin have potential intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity.
However, the spread of the difference of 1% across both genomes is still a big difference; therefore, there is a waiting for decisive results for concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not primarily known yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live for up to 48 hours in artificial ambient dry environments and less than 20°C and up to 40%-50% at humidity 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, for 30 minutes at 56°C and is sensitive to ultraviolet rays; Ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively deactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks resistivity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to novel viruses.
At present no detailed study has been reported regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Generally, after the virus enters the nutrient, it is first identified by the endogenous immune system of the nutrient, including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
By different routes, the manifestation of virus flow factors induces the synthesis of maturity and type I interferon (IFNs) of dendritic cells which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates mecrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV’s N protein can assist the virus in avoiding immune reactions.
Soon, the optimized immune response gets involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific immunitys and CD8+ T cells kill virus-infected cells directly.
T auxiliary cells produce pro-flux cytokine to assist protecting cells.
However, CoVs can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Tricolon resistivity, including supplements and immunitys such as C3a and C5a, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, the immunity isolated from the cured patient deactivated the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive response to the immune system generates a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and also multi-organ failure and death in the worst conditions.
The herd is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women with the coherentity of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by the onset.
It is common that people who come in contact with a higher number of viruses or who have repulsive functions are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, the 1,099 cases study saw that the incubation period was on average 3 days and was ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, the recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases saw that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus prevent infected but symptomless people from transmitting viruses to other people.
As a general practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus usually require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the warranty time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the dominant and early symptom of COVID-19 with which there can be no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, sore throat, narcissism, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced breathing pain and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly increased the growth of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity and cogulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and with acute fever without pulmonary abnormalities should be examined for premature diagnosis.
Demographics study at the end of December 2019 saw that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for respiratory distress, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of the herd produced by transmission from the family herd and the symptomless person.
Comparatively, the 2012 demographic study saw that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and breathing troubles (55%), as the main symptoms.
However, much more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them needed ventilation support in patients and this is consistent with MERS’ greater lethality than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
SARS patients have observed that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), respiratory distress (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and around 14%-20% of patients needed ventilation support.
The COVID-19 fatality rate was 2% as of February 14, when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Comparatively, SARS’s mortality rate was at 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on the demographic study of June 2012.
The earlier study informed that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in table 1.1.
The above figures indicate that the spread potential of SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both the latter.
Therefore, controlling the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The herd often begins with a single family or a single mass or vehicle such as a cruise vessel.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence or contact with infected persons or patients in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the beginning.
However, it has been reported that people can convection the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recoveries discharged from the hospital can re-convuls the virus, which warns to increase the time of quarantine.
In the early stage patients have normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymph cells).
For example, lymph cell count &lt; white blood cell count including 1×109/L &lt; lymphopenia with 4×109/L and enlarged aspartate aminotransfer levels and virality were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin increased in the blood of some patients and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, a product of fibrin collapse present in the blood, the level of de-dimer, was increased and lymph cell count continued to decrease.
Abnormalities are found in chest radiography in most COVID-19 patients and are represented by bilateral speckled images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is seriously compromised due to uncontrolled flow, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis.
The dysfunction of the type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension and thus reduces lung bloating capacity and increases the risk of lung stop functioning.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often remain parallel with the most severe condition of the disease.
The first pathological analysis on COVID-19 on 18 Feb 2020 saw the emergence of pneumocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, the formation of hyalin membranes and porous leaks of lymphatic cells, and the multimetallic multicentric cells that corresponded to the pathology and ARDS of viral infection and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by Reverse-Transcryptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high erroneous-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used to diagnose in China on 13 Feb 2020 (which was no longer dependent only on RT-PCR).
The same situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical expressions, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 Feb 2020 Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which, using dipstick, detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA blocks at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input).
If verified in clinical samples, hope new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients with other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and try out various therapies previously used or proposed to treat other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapies include antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, plasma from cured patients, current and potential treatments with Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from cured patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are vying to develop virus-resistant and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks the lungs primarily at the beginning and possibly also on other organs in the lower range, which express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain a major threat to patients and are the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is important for relieving symptoms and saving lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-entrance ventilation, and ingress mechanical ventilation based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified heart-pulmonary byway technique used in the treatment of a life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
Also, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting the function of vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine storm results from excessive response of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine Storm is the type of systemic conductive reaction characterized by the discharge of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokine provoke immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are major causes of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, IL6-resistant monoclonal immunity, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include changes in T cell-guided immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK interception; Blinatumomab; repressive of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids as immune suppressants were widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of migratory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, dramatically affecting disease-diagnosis, especially non-vascular oscillating.
Nevertheless, it is recommended to carefully use the short-term procedures of corticosteroids in critically ill COVID-19 patients at low to medium doses.
By the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog given to the vein has been found to be effective in an American patient of COVID-19.
Remdesivir is initially a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also showed a possible interception of other monologic RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made available the compounds to China to carry out two tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are quite expected.
Also, Baricitinib, Interferon-α, Iopinavir/Ritonavir, and Ribavirin are suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions may occur after joint therapy with Iopinavir/Ritonavir.
These treatments should be carefully monitored for interactions with other drugs used in patients.
Plasma and immune production from cured patients
There has been a long history of blood aggregation from cured patients with an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from being disease-ridden.
In fact, cured patients have a high level of immunity relative to pathogens in the blood.
Immunitys produced by B lymph cells to fight pathogenic and other external substances are immunoglobulins (Ig) and they identify unique molecules in pathogenic and deactivate them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with low flow and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, unless specific therapies are developed, verification and clarification are necessary to propose to use the method at a larger level.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, certain disadvantages related to plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate immune response and cause cytokine discharge syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentrations of immunity in the blood are generally low, and plasma is high in demand for treating critically ill patients.
It is hard to develop and produce specific immunitys so fast to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that code effective immunitys or examine effective immunity to essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can rapidly increase the production of immunity.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend primarily on the combination of different components in a different formula based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are yet unknown or redundant because it is hard to remove and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stages due to a lack of effective and specialized therapy for COVID-19.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), saw the highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 in many provinces of China, while Hubei Province where TCM was used only in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, the recovery rate was minimum (13%).
However, this is quite a thick comparison as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 Feb 2020, Bid Zheng and colleagues published studies to compare only Western Drug (WM) treatment and joint treatment of WM and TCM.
He found that the body temperature in the WM+TCM group was remarkably less than normal, the time required for symptoms to be known and hospitalized only.
The most impressive was the WM+TCM group's symptomatic worsening rate (lightly severe) significantly lower than the WM group alone (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the death rate was only lower in the WM+TCM group than the WM group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM is still awaiting more well-controlled tests at more centers on a larger scale.
It will also be interesting to mark the system of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a lot of fear from highly contagious and deadly disease and even those who are quarantined experience dullness, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, low-oxidation and cough as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia generated by corticosteroids, can cause more discomfort and mental agony.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, several psychological diseases, including constant stress, restlessness, panic attacks, Psychiatric euphoria, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide, were reported.
Find mandatory contact as part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak and quarantine; make people more restless and deflated about the effects of fingering, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspected individuals, and persons exposed to them, as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health parties, the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid continuous and accurate updates about SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans and close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to interfere with the link of transmission from animal funds and infected humans to sensitive nutrients and are often supplemented by antiviral treatment under the control of the pandemic due to rising viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and powerful inactivated immunity to SARS-CoV.
Live-derived vaccines have been evaluated in SARS's organismic paradigms.
However, their protection towards these vivo efficacy and zoonotic virus infection of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and deadly challenging patterns are still to be determined before the onset of any clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS slowly ended 17 years ago and no new case has been reported ever since.
Conversely, the sporadic cases and herds of MERS continue to originate in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the areas of the pandemic.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed and some have been evaluated in animal clones using passive viruses, DNA placids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of recombinant proteins.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is an essential and important task for non-resistive persons to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome difficulty due to the long-term need in vaccine development (on average 18 months) and dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to reveal its entire clinical procedure in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients may recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to create disease-diagnosis patterns to determine the priority of their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies yet reported, the following factors may affect or relate to the pathological diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS diagnosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases COVID-19 mainly occurred at the age of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of the patients were over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients who need intensive care were more likely to have underlying operatives and complications and did not have such needs. They were significantly older than they were (at 51 vs. 66 of the median age), which indicates age as a forecast factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been informed that SARS-CoV-2 can also connect with ACE2-positive cholangiocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have deep correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood shows the severity of the flow or tissue damage and is proposed as a potential predictive factor of disease, response to therapy, and finally recovery.
Correspondence of CRP level with the severity of COVID-19 and diagnosis has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransfers (AST), elenain aminotransfers (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can help predict the result.
These enzymes are widely manifested in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are freed during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major Clinical Symptoms: The topical progression of chest radiography and clinical symptoms along with other problems should be considered for forecasting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressors commonly used as conjugate therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of migratory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from life-long disability and non-vascular ligaments with poor life quality.
Therefore, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and COVID-19 patients for the short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress during the outbreak of COVID-19, as they often endured the long-term and extreme uncertainty of quarantine and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and long-term support to help these people get out of stress and get back to normal life.
According to demographic studies yet, COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
Along with replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produces mild or no symptoms at the initial stage of infection like other CoVs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stage or incubation period with causing too much difficulty in the control of the pandemic.
However, SARS-CoV was believed to have been transmitted when patients were too sick, while most transmissions were not during the initial phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, huge efforts are currently on in China, including the lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of almost the entire public.
Although these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, which indicates the pandemic’s ups and downs.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the unloading phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19 that appears to be more contagious than SARS would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established the pattern to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had recovered and had been identified in both mid-turbines and throat fahs of patients who had been hospitalised 2 weeks ago, indicating that the identified new virus could become a recurring case like influenza.
However, there have been promising signals from China based on the decreasing number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Initially, one million cases were forecast to occur with half a million deaths of Ebola.
However, by stringent quarantine and segregation, the disease has finally been controlled.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 would become weak in infectiousness and end up ending in the end or becoming a less pathogenic virus coexistence with human.
The comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic from SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible from coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in feces, which also generates new chances of oral transmission from feces.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health care providers, were possibly caused by medical infections.
Therefore, a lot of caution should also be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and people next to them or infected people in contact with patients.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 Respiratory Masks (Series #1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets from potentially infected person from going to the air or sticking to the surface of things from where they can go to others.
However, only N95 (Series # 1860s) masks can prevent as small as 10 to 80 nm from inhaling the virion with only 5% of the virion being completely exceeded; SARS-CoV-2 in size is the same as SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particulates can also surpass five surgical masks placed one on top of one, health care providers with direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series #1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, health care providers should wear isolation gowns that fit to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person with eyes.
A physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2 on January 22, 2020, although he was wearing N95 masks; the virus may have entered the body with its smelter eye.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent facial armor or glasses while working with patients.
In the affected or potentially affected areas, the general public is highly suggested to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and possibly limit contact with infected persons.
For people, three feet are considered proper distance to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as the new virus for the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, due to excessive similarity with SARS-CoV it would have made China highly careful based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan’s Centers for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has less human-to-human infection and limited fertility and has no problem preventing and limiting disease.
This message freed the public a lot of fear, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Vasant Mahotsav and the delicate time left to limit the disease to the minimum level in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China can learn from it a big deal and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be quite careful when making (1) public announcements because every word counts for citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) instead of waiting for formal information from physicians or authorities should be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from clinics; (3) should be more restrictive to limit the potential pandemic to an early stage rather than an effort to console the public; and (4) issue often targeted and effective practices to raise public awareness of the pandemic and periodically examine the society’s response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread to nearly 50 other countries across China and the world by the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused SARS to be repeated.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for limiting the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects men more than older people and women than young people, and severity and mortality in the elderly is also higher than in the youth.
SARS’s mortality rate is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients broadcast the virus even if they are symptomless while SARS patients often do it when they are seriously ill, which creates a lot of difficulty limiting the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
It partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads with more speed and prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can be re-positive for the virus.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, many serious cases are yet to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bats SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
The basic nutrient, let’s say which animal was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bat to human?
Without finding out the answer to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop broadcasting and the outbreak can never be recurred.
Although molecular cloning and biochemical tests have observed that SARS-CoV-2 connects with ACE2, how does the virus properly enter air pathway cells and then make pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-manifested cells to other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot get fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during transmission into human?
Will it become a global pandemic, gradually ending like SARS or will it continue to happen periodically like the flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above-mentioned and many other questions.
However, whatever the price we have to pay, we have no choice but to quickly stop the pandemic and bring our lives to normalcy.
Animal Origin of Human Corona Virus
Mutations and adaptations have led to simultaneous development of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their nutrients (including humans) over a period of thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coVs (HCoVs) that produced a mild disease like colds were aware of.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the destructive and deadly nature of the infection of the HCV.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has brought CoVs to light again and shocked us by the more contagious potential but decreased pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a bacterial disease and it will be useful for us to understand the animal origin of HCoVs.
Most HCovs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
There is also information about the intermediate corpus nutrients of some HCovs.
The identification of animal nutrients in the prevention of human diseases has direct implications.
Checking the interactions of cov-nutrients in animals can also have important insights on the pathogenicity of cov in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the history of discovery as well as current information about seven HCovs, focusing on animal-borne origin and interracial transmission.
Importantly, we see the gradual growth of viruses and the variation of different HCovs from the perspective of gene recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need to successfully change the nutrients and the implications of gradual development of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Corona viruses (CoVs) are from the coronaviridae family including groups of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses sheltering the largest genomes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses were named “CoVs” due to crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs contain unbroken genomes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genomes have two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which transform into pp1a and pp1ab replicated polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of ORF for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many pedigree-specific ancillary proteins are also coded by different pedigrees of CoVs.
Depending on the variation in protein sequences, COV is divided into four generations (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV, and Delta-CoV), of which beta-CoV is mostly HCVs in generation and is sub-divided into four genealogy (A, B, C, and D).
Ethnic evidence shows that bats and mice are mostly the gene sources of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major shells of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently overcome species barriers and emerged as some of the important human pathogens.
To date, seven Human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-299E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCov-299E, HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1 and HCov-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms like colds and/or diarrhea.
Conversely, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, with a greater chance of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperfluous manifestations, generating severe lower respiratory pathway infections in relatively more patients.
The first HCoV-299E breed, B814, was separated from the runny nose of cold patients in the mid 1960s.
Since then, further information was collected by a detailed study about the HCoV-729E and the HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak that the infection of the HCoVs is generally harmless.
SARS outbreak in 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, infecting more than 8000 people with a mortality rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak produced a persistent pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
2019 Novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which is later named SARS-CoV-2, is the ongoing epidemic factor agent of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to which 3,120 people have lost their lives by March 3, 2020 and more than 91,000 people have been infected.
The warning bell is ringing and the world is to be prepared for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCovs have animal origins from bats, rats or domestic animals.
Many evidences support gradual development from all HCVs bats, including viruses that are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show highly genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge therapeutic, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detection of animal source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and binding factors of the species crossing.
It can guide or make accessible SARS-CoV-2 cells, intermediates, and boosting animals in search of nutrients with a significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the animal-borne origin, interracial transmission and pathogenicity of the HCovs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common topic that the native viruses of the HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural cell nutrients, but become pathogenic after interethnic transmission into new nutrients.
We will also review the trend of gradual development of the HCV in which the increase in infectiousness is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this perspective.
Animal CoVs information dates back to the late 1930s.
Before the first isolated HCV-299E breed from the nasal flow of patients with infected common cold, different CoVs were isolated from many infected animals, including turkey, rat, cow, boar, cat and dog.
Seven HCVs have been identified over the past decades.
A brief summary (Table 1) of the course of the history of the discovery of the HCV will be informative and instructive.
The first breed of HCV-299E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, which later adapted to grow in the cells lines of the WI-38 lung.
In patients with HCoV-299E, 10~20% of cases saw symptoms of colds including headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, the HCV-OC43 was separated from the gradual passage into the brain of the milky rat and from organ enrichment.
Clinical characteristics of the HCV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of infection produced by the HCV-229E that are figuratively indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathway pathogens such as Influenza A virus and Rhinovirus.
Both the HCoV-292E and the HCoV-OC43 are spread around the globe and are likely to transmit majorly during the winter with temperate climates.
Usually, the period of gradual development of these two viruses is less than a week, after which about a 2-week disease occurs.
According to a study by human volunteers, mild colds developed among healthy individuals infected with HCoV-729E.
Only a few patients with immunity disabilities see a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “Atypical Pneumonia,” was the first well-documented epidemic caused by the first well-documented HCV in human history and the factor for it, the third discovered HCV, is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be marked at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
With SARS epidemic spreading to many countries and continents, there were 8,096 cases recorded with 774 deaths.
In addition to the most spreaders, it was estimated that with a 4 to 7 day gradual development period and the maximum viral bearing visible on the 10th day of the disease, almost two secondary cases could increase due to every case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have symptoms such as muscle pain, headaches, fever, malaise, and chills, after which breathing pain, cough, and respiratory crises appear as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, neurotic hepatic work checks and increased creatine are common abnormalities related to the laboratory of Kinease SARS.
The spread of alveolar damage, epithelium cell proliferation, and macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require later intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, usually gastrointestinal tract with cytokine storms, many organs including liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be fatal especially for patients with immunity disabilities.
The virus was first separated from the lung open biopsy from the patient's relative to the indicator that traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a lot of efforts have been made in the research of HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child at the end of 2004 in the Netherlands.
Early on, it was found to be spread to young children, the elderly, and patients with respiratory diseases who were disabled in immunity.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
In the second independent study, it described the separation of the same virus from the nose sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands but in fact it is spread across the globe.
It is estimated that around 4.7% of common respiratory diseases occur due to HCoV-NL63 and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to anti-inflammatory larynx, also known as croup.
In the same year, the HCV-HKU1 was separated from the 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis from the community, it was also reported to be related to severe asthma outbreaks of HCoV-HKU1.
Like the HCoV-NL63, HCoV-299E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found all around the world while causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these HCoVs met from the community have been well adapted in humans and are generally less likely to mutated to produce highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more toxic sub-type of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Usually, they also become less toxic or pathogenic when these HCovs earn the ability to transmit efficiently and sustain themselves in humans.
MERS-CoV was first separated from the patient’s lungs aged 60 in Saudi Arabia in 2012, developing acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, near-relations occasionally reported imported cases with secondary proliferation in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea.
Clinical manifestations of MERS featuring progressive severe pneumonia match SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute kidney failure, which has been observed only in MERS so far in diseases caused by HCov.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory confirmed cases with a high death rate of 34.4% were reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December 2019 to the end, flocks of pneumonia patients belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 infection were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, all over the world.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as an international concern public health emergency and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the death rate of cases in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it it it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that appear as fever, cough, and respiratory distress.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly increase as acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of the racist descent.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic, but more transmissible, than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptomsless patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and can contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCovs and seeing asymmetry has shown very interesting similarities and variations.
First, the pathogenesis period and the duration of the procedure of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCovs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to those of SARS-CoV and the HCoVs acquired from the four community (i.e. HCov-292E, HCov-OC43, HCov-HKU1 and HCov-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows features that are usually observed during the infection of HCVs acquired from the community, including non-specific, mild, or without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also sees patterns featuring both the HCoVs and SARS-CoV acquired from the community.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the infectivity of HCVs acquired from the least community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after advancing in humans like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCovs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces samples.
Does the rectum-mouth transmission of SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV, yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see if the SARS-CoV-2 acquired from the community can behave seasonally like the cases of the HCoVs.
Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2’s characteristics, including infectiousness, pathogenicity, and persisting proliferation, will be effective on the final outcome of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
The HCoVs, derived from all four communities that produce mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans have become well adapted to these four HCovs.
In other words, both can survive the ancient HCoV epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that develop serious HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To do this, the accumulation of optimized mutations that prevent nutrient restriction factors will have to replicate HCovs in humans in sufficient limits.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to be fully adapted into humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission in humans will be difficult to prevent from quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the CoVs acquired from the four community have been transmitting to the human population while causing colds in patients with immunity disabilities.
These viruses do not require animal shells.
Conversely, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to remain and spread in their animal-borne shells and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediates and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the HCoVs derived from the four community.
At least in the present time it is very contagious like the HCoVs acquired from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs acquired from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and transmitted to humans without any shell or intermediate animal nutrients.
Before discussing the animal values of HCovs, it will be very useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of successive growth, natural, enshrined, intermediate and enhancing nutrients of HCovs.
An animal is a hierarchical growth nutrient of the HCV, if it shelters a very close ancestor with sharing high parity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this nutrient.
In the same way, the Kosh nutritives give shelter to the HCV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the nutrition is naturally infected and the natural nutrients of the HCoV or its ancestral virus are.
Conversely, if the HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around human entry, it is not well adapted to new nutrients and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can serve as an animal-borne source of human infection and then play the role of nutrient-enhancing by transmitting it to humans by temporarily replicating the virus and then increasing the level of human infection.
An HCV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate nutrient.
On the other hand, HCovs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this condition, intermediate nutritive becomes natural nutritive.
The epidemiological data retrospectively observed that the SARS indicator case had a history of contact with game-played animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that there was a greater prevalence of SARS-CoV anti-IgG among animal traders than the general public.
The masked palm civet (Paguma Larvata) and rook dog in the living animal markets were recognized as convulsants of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was backed indirectly by the fact that no SARS was further reported after all of the markets were killed by the Seaweight.
However, it has been reported that most of the Masked Palm Sevettes in wild or farms that did not come into contact with live animal markets had SARS-CoV negative, which indicates that Masked Pal Sevettes can only be as serious as mid-enhancing nutrients and not as natural shells of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou’s markets have SARS-CoV-resistant immunity, these possibilities cannot be refuted that many species of small mammals can also be intermediate boosting nutrients of SARS-CoV.
All of these seem to be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV.
The follow-up discovery of SARS-CoV natural animal nutrients revealed a very close bat CoV named SARS-related rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARsr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV-antifungal immunity and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bats share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with CoVs, SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation stone for the new concept that bats are the nutrients of the emerging human pathogens.
Many SARS like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none other than WIV1 have been isolated as a live virus.
Human Angiotensin changer enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from the feces samples of bats were demonstrated to use Bat, Sevette, and Human ACE2 as a receptor for cellular penetration.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients who were healthy was able to deactivate WIV1.
As of now, WIV1 is the nearest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite more similarity in both these viruses, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not the nearest parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not SARS-CoV's closest nutritional shells.
The ethnologic analysis groups MERS-CoV into groups similar to bats cov-hku4 and bats cov-hku5.
Bats use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptide peptides 4 (DPP4) for the CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV virus penetration.
MERS-CoV’s RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences are ethnically close to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
As of now, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bats CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, the closest shells of bat MERS-CoV may not be nutritional either.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have seen that humped camels in many African countries like the Camels of Middle East origin are seropositive towards MERS-CoV-specific inactivation immunitys.
Like the virus found in humans living MERS-CoV, humped camels separated from the nostrils of the nose, indicating that camels are the authentic shells of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV generally had mild symptoms but had too much virus clearance.
Notably, infected camels remove viruses not only from the respiratory route but also from the mal-mouthed route, which is also the main route for the evacuation of viruses from bats.
However, questions are still present since there is no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of MERS’ multiple confirmed cases symptoms, possibly because of human transmission or any unknown transmission pathways that include species of animals sheltering MERS-CoV.
Rhinolophus shares 96.2% nucleotide parity from CoV RaTG13 bats separated from bats associated with the species.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is enough to assign ancestral relationships.
That is, bats can’t be nutritional as close as SARS-CoV-2, unless there are almost identical bats CoVs in the future.
Probably, SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal nutritive Huanan must be among the wild species sold and killed in the bulk market of seafood that had several early cases associated with COVID-19, suggesting a human transmission event from potential animals.
Several recent studies have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as Pangolin (Manis Javanica) can also shelter the ancestral beta-CoVs belonging to SARS-CoV-2.
These new Pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RatG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-digenus of SARS-CoV-2-similar viruses in the racehorse genealogy, one of which shares a more uniform planetary binding area (RBD) with the SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RBD of RaTG13 are very diverse despite the genewide more sequenced similarity.
The earlier study of sick pangolin also reported a group of overlapping DNA of the viral from lung samples, related to SARS-CoV-2 in the same way.
The study adopted several different convoluted methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence with a full length of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that Pangolin is one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct Pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 is less than that of SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The route of gradual development of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be established in bats, pangolin and other mammals.
Where the most sequence similarity in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin is found, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs are the most genome-wide sequence similarity in SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13.
It is a very hypothetical idea that excessive similarity between Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is selectively due to intermediary convergence gradual development.
An alternative offer favors a recombination between Pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RatG13 in the third wild organism species.
As a driving force of gradual development, the recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest animal-borne origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal origins of HCoV-729E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Ethnic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-299E bats may have originated from CoVs, while HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 ancestral viruses have been found in the rodents.
It has been reported that the bats named ARCoV.2 (Applechain Ridge CoV) found in three colored bats from North American saw a close connection with the HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, another bat named HCoV-292E Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 was genetically related to CoV, found in Ghana, although Chemlids are also its suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the summary of current information on animal origin of known HCVs is given in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The racist analysis has provided evidence of the interracial transmission events of the HCVs in history.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic animals around 1890, the respiratory infection epidemic was observed.
The history of intra-caste transmission of HCV-229E is less obvious.
Significantly close to the HCV-229E, bat Alpha-CoVs have been found.
Among them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Many evidences support transmission from virus bats directly into humans.
Previously, humans have had contact with bats in the shared ecological habitat of the Alpaca and not the Alpaca.
Instead, humans have a close connection to Alpaca.
Second, HCV-299E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while Alpaca Alpha-CoV led to an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Ultimately, Alpaca Alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpaca HCV-329E-related alpha-CoV receives from humans cannot be refuted.
In fact, bat rabies are direct sources of human pathogenic viruses, including viruses, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So more amazing is not that bats can directly transmit HCV-229E to humans.
Alternatively, where bats are the gene pools of Alpha-CoVs HCoV-292E, alpaca and humped camels can be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just like the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interracial transmission from bat-fed camels and humped camels to humans.
The gradual development of MERS-CoV from bats is known to be its primary hallmark and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide rich beams of virus species for interracial exchange and interracial transmission of genetic fractions.
Long-age, dense settlements, close social interaction, and excessive ability to fly are favorable conditions for all bats being the ideal “virus broadcaster”.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered humped camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted into these camels that have turned from intermediate nutrients to stable and natural nutritive shells.
MERS-CoV produces a very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has sporadic transmission accidents in humans and humans remain the last nutrients of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be maintained.
Unlike the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of Pangolin in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
Specifically, Pangolin beta-CoVs are much more pathogenic in Pangolin.
They can be the last nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, just like a civet in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of intra-caste transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to human are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, the cells of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses can be nutritionally similar to that of Bat SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share eco habitat with bats by hitting or mining coal.
Second, Pangolin may be one of the intermediate boosting nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus was revamped.
Humans get infected with viruses by killing and consuming game meats.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need for survey of immunity in domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in the third species that have contacted both bats and pangolin.
Animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being discovered.
Apart from different types of animal nutrients, three major factors regarding virality are also important in crossing the species barriers of CoV easily.
First, their relatively higher mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-fibre RNA viruses, an estimated mutation rate of CoV with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacement per site 2 per year can be considered “medium” to “higher” depending on the stage of COV adaptation in new nutrients.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, the deletion of which can also lead to excessive variability and loss of attenuity or life capacity.
Interestingly, nucleotide analog Remdesivir, is considered by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase to suppress the replication of the CoV.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising SARS-CoV-2-antifungal agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of CoVs is ten million times higher than their nutrients.
Also, mutation rates are often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to nutrients.
Compared with SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower mutation rate, which points to a higher level of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already been adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
With SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to MERS-CoV which is well adapted to humped camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic flows will rapidly deactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the larger RNA in CoV puts additional plasticity on genome mutations and recombinations, increasing the likelihood of interracial co-gradual development, which is beneficial for the emergence of Novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frames and coded protein functions at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, the CoVs change the representations randomly during the RNA replication by the unique “copy-choice” procedure.
In nutrients that work as a mixture vessel, fibrous changes often occur during the COV RNA transcription.
Highly uniform full-length and subgenic RNA can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Ethnic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 as well as in animal CoVs such as bats SL-CoV and bats CoV-HKU9.
Interaction of Viruses with respect to Transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutritive receptor is another important factor affecting interracial transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choice during interethnic transmission events.
SARS-CoV with mutations on S protein’s RBD, in particular, is considered to be increasingly adaptable to different nutrients, based on a comparative analysis of the detractors between human and sevate SARS-CoVs.
Typically, RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cell receptor and is chosen by nutritive immune response with intensification.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that connects with human ACE2 as well as its co-clients for viral penetration.
SARS-CoV’s RBD is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, sevettes, rats, and rook dogs, causing intra-caste transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed separately from human and sevate viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-linked motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of the Sevette SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that can increase the attraction of the spike protein’s interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid replacements can be crucial in optimizing the viral in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein indicates that the bond similarity of its S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate 10 to 20 times more attraction of this joint than the addition between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be of interest to determine if SARS-CoV-2 transmission would require another co-client.
Interestingly, the HCoV-NL63 also connects to ACE2, but to the different part of the S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as Aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-Acetillated Silic Acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after intra-caste transmission from their animal feeds.
The result of the interracial transmission of HCVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to the cellular receptor.
The variation of these nutritive proteins between humans and the natural nutritive shells of HCVs, such as bats, humped camels, and rats, can become a hindrance in inter-caste transmission.
Nutrient dependence factors have to be overturned for successful intra-caste transmission of HCVs.
In this regard, molecular determinants are yet to be identified and described in this critical area of virus-nutritive interaction.
Using CRISPR’s latest technology, non-biased genome-wide checks of nutritional dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 can be fruitful.
Emergence of Novel HCoVs: Return to Basic Basis
The variety of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCVs.
In this sense, bats serve as gene shells of CoVs, HCovs.
At the same time, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also lead to the development of the HCoV and the work of two important stages in the process.
For example, novel protein-coding genes have the potential to alter viral multiples of acquisition or loss too much.
In SARS-CoV auxiliary proteins, ORF8 is considered important in adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to code diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been characterised in breeds separated at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered a adaptation mutation that promotes the transformation of cells.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs genealogies, with the RNA-based RNA polymerase recognizing a very large number of small recombinant areas.
Recombination locations were also identified in parts of NSP9, mostly NSP10, and NSP14.
In the same way, it has been observed that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCovs, with HCovs recombining with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial elections can make irresistible changes to the viral genome, possibly due to viruses free of choice pressure, such as by the nutritive immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of the full-length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype breed due to two-nucleotide deletions.
While the intact ORF4 can be seen in bats and camel viruses belonging to the HCV-229E, the Alpaca Alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, leading to frameshifts.
Finally but not less important, the gradual evolution of novel HCovs is also caused by the pressure of choice in its shell nutrients.
Symptomless or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates inter-adaption between CoVs and bats.
It seemed that bats have been well adapted to CoVs structurally and physically.
For example, defects in activation of pro-inflammatory reaction in bats effectively reduce pathogen generated by CoVs.
Additionally, the inhibitory natural malignant cell proponents of natural malignant cell activity in bats. Regulation of NKG2/CD94 and major tissue conformance are repressed due to low expression level of complex category I molecules.
In addition, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from a more metabolic activity of bats may suppress the replication of the CoV and affect proof readings by the exoribonuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus breeds when new nutritive enters.
More pathogenic CoV breeds can also be developed by recombination, which can lead to new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCVS have emerged over the past two decades.
CoVs, such as bats and camels, are non-pathogenic in nutrients or produce mild symptoms.
They firmly replicate without showing strong nutritive resistance response.
In this, it is hidden why symptomless carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms, mainly caused by immune response and hyperactivity of the cytokine storm, which has as much immune response as severe lung damage.
In contrast, in symptomless carriers, the immune response has separated from the CoV replication.
The same strategy to isolate immune response can have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2-resistant therapy.
The interferon reaction is particularly sharp in bats.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in humans should be at least beneficial in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, the NLRP3 inflamesum activation in the bats is faulty.
By this logic, the interception of NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general topic that produced SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where 95% nucleotide similarity has been observed with SARS-CoV of Bat Beta-CoV, Bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While markets have been seen to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
SARS-CoV-2 has found surprisingly similar Pangolin beta-CoVs, which indicates that Pangolin may be one of the intermediate nutrients or Pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to gene fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions persist, no evidence has been found that SARS-CoV-2 is intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come to the news due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the animal funds of HCVs in animal origin and standard transmission.
The evidence pervasively shows that SARS-CoV is the original bats of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and transmission in humans is caused by intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection arises due to contact between humans and the sewage in the markets, the SARS epidemic should have been effectively eliminated by closing the wet markets and hitting the sewage there.
For the same reason, Pangolin should be removed from the weight market to prevent animal transmission due to the discovery of many generalogicals of Pangolin beta-CoVs close enough to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to human by Pangolin and other mammals and how future tests remain to be clarified.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered humped camels for several decades.
These camels are important means of traffic for locals as well as major sources of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely spread in the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all the camels to control MERS as done in China’s wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene forms may emerge to produce outbreaks.
The diverse animal-borne CoVs are roaming in wild organisms.
In particular, covs with animal-borne capacity are very diverse.
It is quite likely that the personnel development and recombination of these animalized CoVs will bring forth new CoVs that are more contagious and/or fatal in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wild animals in some regions of China should be abandoned by eating culture.
With the hard examination of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparation and response should be planned.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural shells until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that aid the spread of viruses, the possibility of humans contacting them and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about staying away from bats.
A better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients requires constant monitoring of mammals which will be useful in preventing human transmission from animals and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral animal disease is to keep humans away from the ecological habitats of the natural shells of animalized viruses.
Many parts of the animal-genital puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the native virus of SARS-CoV-2 to Pangolin, it would be interesting to see what circumstances bats and pangolin can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans come in contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolin.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection must be performed.
Whether it is bats, pangolin or any other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continuous investigations in this area will clarify the gradual development pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant impacts in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of “doubtful cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19
On 6 Feb 2020, our team published quick consultation guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides our experience and reasonable context to fight the pandemic around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being constantly updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of “doubtful cases” and “confirmed cases” according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has now been officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Extreme Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has marked COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and has been published online in military medical research on 06 Feb 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and information is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, a total of seven editions have been released by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 with fundamental changes in some contexts in the guidelines (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
Now a comment has been made by Zhou et al. on our guideline, they have introduced a simple marking offer based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also gave valuable references to this pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our thanks.
However, their work needs to be updated as per the latest diagnostics and treatment guidelines (the seventh test version) and recent studies for COVID-19.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), any single item in pandemic history needs to be combined with two items of clinical expressions to perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, or three items of clinical expressions need to be completed if the clear pandemic is without history:
Epidemic history: (1) the history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) the history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid tests); (3) the history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (4) the history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (respirational symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in the ≥2 cases of fever and/or small areas such as in the home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of white blood cells shows normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes in the early stages.
Diagnosis of confirmed case should be based on any single item suspected case of pathogenic or serial proof that is following: (1) Real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 comes positive; (2) Viral whole genome sequencing showing higher symmetry than known novel coronaviruses; (3) Specific IgM immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing and positive for IgG immunity; or SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG immunity to change from negative to positive, or the modulus rapid phase increases by ≥ 4 times in the health benefit stage.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
The pathogenic identification of the blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then to the seventh edition, serial proof was added.
These amendments were based on the ongoing work of researchers who search for samples of the respiratory tract, including an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for quick diagnosis, as well as blood samples, thereby increasing the availability of various specimens, and supporting the bringing in the confirmed criteria of specific immune positive results.
In addition, there are many evidences that remind us to take precautions with nonformal symptomatic and paranoid patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, because they have classified the person without having clinical symptoms as a "low risk".
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “doubtful cases” and “confirmed cases,” we suggest locating and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new deaths from COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the most one-day figure ever
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
It is by far the biggest figure of deaths from this virus in a day.
Until yesterday, the number of infected cases recorded by the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) included 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr Mirjadi Sabrina Flora reported that four men and one woman have died.
According to Dr Mirjadi, two patients were over 60, between 51 and 60 of the two and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also told that two of those who died belonged to Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
An official from the hospital told Anadolu agency, a local news center, that the dying name was Jalal Saifur Rahman who was a director of the Anti-Corruption Commission in Bengali and was being taken care of at the Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh’s Minister for Road Transport and Bridges Ubaidul Qadar said that by the coming Saturday, road transport will be kept closed for a longer time than earlier.
This public transport captive was started on March 26 and was to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essentials such as medical items, fuel, and food was not barred.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two people and one of them returned from Italy on March 8.
On March 19, those three men were healed.
Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 infection cases across one million
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million.
COVID-19 is being seen to be linked to at least 52 thousand deaths.
The day this figure crossed, the first coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first death of the coronavirus in Zambia has been reported on the same day.
North Korea claimed that until Thursday it was included in some countries that are yet to be free from corona virus infections.
Till yesterday the World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours preceding 10 am (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 2 lakh 44 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the US, and this has led to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News quoted Johns Hopkins University data as saying that the coronavirus infection on Wednesday caused more than 1,000 deaths in the US.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobianin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Parliament of Portugal voted in favour of raising the national emergency 15 days; the said resolution passed by 215 votes, ten members were absent and one voted in protest.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a round-the-clock curfew in the cities of holy Mecca and Medina; the first curfew time was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dawine announced that the order to stay at home in the state has been extended to May 1.
Stores in Australia reduced the number of toilet paper they can buy at once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles nationally reduced the number of toilet paper they could buy at once in all their stores to two and a package, respectively.
ALDI had also imposed a one-pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages at checkout sites and on Facebook pages of chains.
Buyers are reportedly shopping together for the situation of needing to set themselves apart due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the limit for buying toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed the restriction of buying a maximum of four packs at once on March 4 and 5, respectively.
In its March 8 press release, Coles reported that despite the four-pack ban being implemented, “stocks are still running out within an hour of delivery in many stores”, and described this demand as unprecedented, while ALDI called it “unexpected” in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesman for Woolworths, there was a “strong surge” in sales last week.
Costco’s store in Canberra also limited the volume to two packs last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered more larger packages to the suppliers and also increased the frequency of delivery.Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI raised stocks to provide the preplanned Wednesday special soon.
Australian Retailer Association Executive Director Russell Zimmerman said try to increase retailer stock, but the restrictions imposed by the local council at the time of truck delivery make it difficult to do so.
In such a situation, when suppliers are trying to meet demand and the number of specials has been reduced in advance, Russell is expected to increase production costs.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after premature release of the stock, some stores may not operate a particular Wednesday.
Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, reported in a report by News.com.au that stores fill stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it doesn’t have a large number of stocks, and then, when all the stock is sold, the big shelf is left empty behind, which makes the lack of sense more difficult.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, “The idea of Coles and Woolworths is [that] if there were a lot of goods on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizers [buyed] and were present in large quantities, the panic could possibly be reduced.”
Who gave a crap, the producer of recycled toilet paper, told last Wednesday that their stock was over.
According to the news.com.au report, the cleanex toilet tissue-making company Kimberley-Clark, and the sorbent-making company Solaris paper insisted that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that in Melbourne, where less auctions are being done than ever due to buyers celebrating holidays on the long weekend of Workers’ Day, some property sellers are giving free toilet paper to first bidders at auctions.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, had an insert with eight pages that was cut to use as toilet paper.
ABC was not willing to place store restrictions in the beginning according to a March 3 report by Australia; in this report, he had said that he had no plans to ban purchases.
Russell Zimmerman further added that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry things, handwash, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evening outside Australia, two packs of 12-roll were imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper at the British supermarket Ocado online.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 as a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus SARS CoV-2 disease COVID-19 as a global pandemic.
Although the term “global pandemic” only means how far a disease spreads, not how dangerous its specific cases are, WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
All countries can still change the path of this global pandemic.
If the country trace the disease in response to it, treat patients, set them apart, put their clues and unite them”, it was to say of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gebryasis.
We are extremely concerned with both the worrying level of dispersion and severity and the worrying level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is “unprecedented”.
In the comments published by CNN in February, he said that “no other respiratory virus except influenza has been detected through continuous global spread.”
Gebrays also revealed a similar idea when he said, “We have not seen the global pandemic from a coronavirus to date.”
And we have not seen any global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time till date,” he added.
This new global pandemic title, the said outbreak in January, has been given after WHO’s facel of declaring an internationally worrisome public health emergency.
This is going to get worse,” Dr Anthony Fotchi, director of the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak.
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide by Thursday and resulted in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus epidemic is a ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was declared an epidemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, around 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in around 97,000 deaths.
Around 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China has been assessed at 4%, while globally it is in the range of 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and exhalation.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days, but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
It has no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
First aid is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people and monitoring and self-separation for those who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace threat controls, and feature shutdowns.
The pandemic has generated serious global socio-economic disorder, spurred postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political, and cultural events, and panicked shopping by people has led to a widespread reduction in supplies.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed nationwide or on a local basis, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world’s students’ population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against other people from areas with Chinese people, East and Southeast Asian origin and appearance, and more virus cases.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased due to low travel and heavy industry closures.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (Capital of Hubei Province) reported group cases of pneumonia caused by unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were associated with the wholesale market of Hunan Seafood and hence the virus is considered to be an animal-borne origin.
The outbreak outbreak virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a new discovered virus with a close connection to bat coronaviruses, Pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Later on December 1, 2019, the earliest known person with symptoms was diagnosed to be sick, and the latter were not visible relations with a group of meat markets.
Two-thirds of the initial group of cases reported in December 2019 were found to have a connection with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post reported that a case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which could be the first case.On 26 February 2020, WHO informed that Italy, Iran and South Korea have suddenly increased with a decrease in new cases in China, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very little information about cases may have been recorded especially in people with mild symptoms.
By February 26, relatively fewer cases were reported among the youth, of which 19 years and younger were 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Valence, United Kingdom’s chief scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before receiving effective group immunity.
Cases refer to the number of people in which COVID-19 has been tested, and according to the official protocol whose tests have been tested positive for them.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were official policies of many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland to not only test people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that these undocumented infections were the transition sources for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than in reported cases.
The initial estimate of the original fertility number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people who are infected with COVID-19 recover.
Among those who are not cured, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had become the cause of death of about 97,000 people.
In China, by February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over the age of 60, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health-related conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic normally refers to dead people tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The real death number from COVID-19 can be very high, as it may not include people dying without tests such as in the home, in the nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death number during the pandemic is 4-5 times more than the official COVID death number.
A spokesman for the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that "we know that the [called death number] has been lowered", a statement supported by descriptive information of low-calculation in the US. Such estimates occur often in the pandemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China took place in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy each, outside of mainland China.
As of March 13, more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica were reported to have died. Several measures are normally used to determine the amount of mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and the amount of tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
This number changes according to the area.
In China, the death-case ratio has been estimated at 17.3% (for them the symptoms began from January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for them the symptoms that began after February 1, 2020). Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of people diagnosed with a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of people who died (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academicians have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-based Medicine estimates that the transition to an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on the first randomized test of COVID-19 and CFR estimates in Germany.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
Mackies Boni of Penn State University said, "When left unchecked, infectious outbreaks are usually stabilized and begin to decrease when they are no longer available for the disease.
But it's almost impossible to guess about when it's going to happen right now".
China government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it can end by June" if all countries follow WHO's advice on how to prevent virus spread.
On March 17, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine’s Adam Kuchersky said SARS-CoV-2 “is likely to remain circulating for one or two years”.
According to the study of Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Shefner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eliminated, because it is transmitted very easily" and it can "turn into seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The severity of the return group will depend on the extent of immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cuffs), decreased smell sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhoids, diarrhoea or sapphire. Almost one in six people according to WHO become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and getting face or lips blue; immediate medical care is advised when these symptoms are present. More development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic trauma, and death.
Some of the infected people may be paralytic, which has no clinical symptoms, but confirms the test result infection, so researchers have issued advice that close monitoring and checking of people with close contact with confirmed infected people should be carried out so that the infection is removed.
The sugar projection of the semiotic ratio ranges from a few to 44%.
The normal pathogenesis period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sensation of smell was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
This disease is believed to be spread mainly during close contact and by small droplets generated during coughing, sneezing or talking; when the near contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without mouth cover can cause drops to go from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8.2 m (27 ft).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by tiny droplets produced during speaking that are more prolonged in the air. Breath drops may also occur during exhaling, including when talking, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Drops can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly by breathing into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as duct insertion and cardiovascular pulmonary therapy (CPR) may cause the fusion of respiratory secretions and thus cause airborne proliferation.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although these concerns are also that it can spread by feces, its risk is considered low.
China government has rejected the possibility of mal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although communication before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease may be possible.
For the first three days before the onset of symptoms, tests have come positive for people’s disease, which suggests that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of confirmed melancholy cases are present in the laboratory, but the melancholy transmission has been identified by some countries during contact detection checks.
According to the European Centers for Disease Preventive and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person in general infects two to three other persons, the virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be traceable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for up to one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.Tests for COVID-19 of pets and other animals have come positive.
There is no evidence that the virus can move from animals to humans, however British authorities recommend washing their hands after being exposed to animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an innovative virus, first separated by three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside of the human body, the virus dies with household soap, which decomposes its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed that it is a virus of animal origin.
Genetic analysis has shown that coronavirus is genetically accompanied by two bat-derived breeds of Gan betacoronavirus, an instrument that belongs to the group of Serbecoviruses (genus B).
It is 96% of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RatG13) at the entire genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference between viruses from Pangolins and viruses from humans to parts of genome sequences.
In comparison to the entire genome so far, the common genetic material between the Pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, insufficient to certify intermediate nutrients to the pangolin.
The infection can be detected by the virus temporarily depending on the symptoms, however confirmation in the end occurs from the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its multiple image features are less specific with similar to other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CTs should not be used as primary tests to investigate or diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which has been released on January 17.
This test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase series reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results normally become available within a few hours to days.
In general, this test is carried out on Nasagrasoni Fah, but one throat fah can also be used. Many laboratories and companies are developing eye-detecting serological tests.
As of 6th April 2020, none of these have proved to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Characteristics of characterization on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absent pulmonary secretion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Having similarity with other infections such as adenoviruses, without confirmation by PCR, there is a limited specificity of imagery in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the CT results of the chest to PCR and demonstrated that although the imagery is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its idea as a screening instrument in epidemic areas.
Artificial knowledge-based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imagen characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CTs.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting that tissue directly into a waste bin.
People who may already have an infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Measures to make physical distance to prevent transmission are also recommended. Many governments have prohibited all non-essential commuting in countries and regions affected by outbreaks or have advised no commuting.
However, the virus has reached a state of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don’t know where and how they got infected. Care providers who care for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and protect the eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of anime location data by governments for this purpose has increased privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement to the limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log proximity to other cellphones of a user.
Users then receive a message if they are in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about infection prevention methods are spreading; for example, it is not effective to rub the nose and gargle with mouthwash.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although many organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
It is recommended to wash hands to prevent the transmission of the disease.
CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty; before eating; and after spraying, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
Additionally, CDC has recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several solutions, including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine (within a minute of disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons, etc., should be disinfected if there is a suspicion or confirmation of a COVID case on a facility like an office or day care.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or a tissue while coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the amount of breath-dropped drops and the distance covered when it comes to talking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing masks can reduce people’s tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hygiene of the hand.” Masks are also recommended to be used by people who are caring for someone with a disease.
WHO has only recommended wearing masks by healthy people if they are at high risk, such as those who are taking care of a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing a mask can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by ordinary individuals.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric. China has recommended the use of disposal-worthy therapeutic masks by particularly normal healthy people, especially when they come in close contact with other people (1 m (3 ft) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand health officials are encouraging people to make clothes face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out to public places without wearing masks or wearing noses and mouth covers.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandated all persons entering the grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a face mask when they go to the public domain.
Taiwan producing ten million masks per day since mid-March has made it mandatory to wear face masks by passengers in trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks while going out, while it has also been recommended to make home-made face masks for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Making social distancing (also called physical distancing) involves infection control work, which aims to slow the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centers.
Individuals can apply ways to make social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now making social distancing mandatory or recommended in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum number of people recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations was sharply reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the public group of more than two people. Individuals with underlying medical conditions such as elderly adults and diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immune system are more at risk of serious disease and complications and they are advised by the CDC to stay in the house as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "making social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the purpose is to reduce physical contact while keeping social interaction either virtual or remote.
The use of the term "social distancing" generated implications that, instead of encouraging people to stay in touch with others through alternative means, should adopt full social segregation. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex with only the person who lives with you, not with the virus or virus symptoms.
Self-separation at home has been recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-separation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine directives have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently visited a country or territory with extensive transmission have been advised to self-qurantiary for 14 days from the time of final potential risk.
The strategies of control of an outbreak are repression or suppression, and mitigation.
The initial stages of the outbreak are carried out with the purpose of detecting infected people as well as other measures to control infection and immunization so as to prevent disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of the disease, the efforts go into a quenching state: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
Both enrichment and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
Repression requires more extreme measures, so that the pandemic can be reversed by reducing the original reproductive number from 1. A part of managing the outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the pandemic's peak, known as mitigating the pandemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services creaking and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-medicinal interventions that can manage outbreaks include individual preventive measures, such as hygiene of hands, wearing of masks on the face and self-warranty; closing of intended community measures such as schools to create physical distance and cancel mass gathering programs; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as cleanliness of surfaces such as environmental measures were carried out in China, more stringent measures aimed at the retention of outbreaks, when the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantine of entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea began a large-scale investigation and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance for those infected who quarantined themselves and those who failed to do so, imposed a big penalty on them.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies.The simulations for Great Britain and the US show that mitigation (not slowing but stopping the spread of the pandemic) and repression (reversing the development of the pandemic) are big challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for extreme health care by up to 2/3 and death by half, but hundreds of people still die and health systems go extreme.
Suppression can be prioritized, but it needs to be maintained until the virus is spreading to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is the first), otherwise the transmission of loosely in measures returns rapidly.
Long-term interventions for the suppression of the pandemic generate social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but there are ongoing development efforts, including testing existing drugs.
Taking cold-cold medicines without prescription, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Many compounds that are already approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
Some "traditional and home remedies" according to WHO may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity for the needs of COVID-19 patients and optimizing health care, is described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The European Regional Office of ECDC and WHO have issued guidelines for transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, canceling selective procedures whenever possible, separation and separation of COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by personnel training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so-called patient zero) might have originated.
The first known case of Novel Coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan seafood, in which live animals were also sold, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of such animals; or, in other words, it belongs to the animal-borne origin.The pneumonia group, which was spotted on December 26th and was treated by physician Zhang Xixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, which informed Wuhan Xiangan CDC on December 27th.
On December 30, a group of physicians from Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about the "SARS-like coronavirus".
The police warned eight physicians, including Lee Wenliang, and another physician, I Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for spreading false rumours.
Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed WHO.
A considerable number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in an early January investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to movement due to the Chinese New Year and being the Wuhan transport center and major rail exchange.
On January 20, China registered about 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latter official data shows that as of 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already developed symptoms. As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the number of most confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and regions.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Shenzhen region have restricted independent movement and established border controls.

The Iranian government has been greatly affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current or former political people.
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on 14 March 2020 wrote a public letter to world leaders seeking help, stating that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran, prompting the U.S. to adopt social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high-level financing for public health.

Coronavirus outbreaks have been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, arising from the use of tools to fight outbreaks globally, fear-driven shopping, and disruption to factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of drugs and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supplier disruption.
In many areas, fear-driven shopping conditions were also observed, which led to a shortage of essential grocery items such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from shelves, which led to a reduction in supply.

This demand has led to a twenty-fold increase in normal value as well as delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This has caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, which has warned WHO that it will jeopardize health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for diegu shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to the lack of infant formulas in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in North Italy and the high demand for food products in the Wuhan region, both regions are avoiding excessive food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of important products have been successful, preventing excessive food shortages that were projected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major decrease in its significant agricultural production, but prices may rise according to industry representatives.
Even in Wuhan city, the shelves of empty food were only temporarily seen, while Chinese government officials issued sugar-meat reserves to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.

Economist Mohammed Al-Arian praised the timely emergency measures of central banks and states.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst affected areas due to traffic restrictions, closure of public places including travel attractions, advice of governments to stop on any trip all over the world.
As a result, many airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Quants, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
Its impact on the cruise line industry was seen by far the most.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The pandemic also coincides with the time of Chunyun, the major travel session associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year celebrations, as well as private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including forbidden city and traditional temple fairs in Beijing.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10, directing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These sectors represented 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of the exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, with schools closed until March and cancelled its New Year celebration. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with store hours decreased or temporarily closed.
Retailers’ visits to Europe and Latin America have declined by 40%.
North America and the Middle East retailers saw a decline of 50-60%.
Those walking to shopping centers declined by 33-43% in March as compared to February.
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America’s estimates, the pandemic-induced recession could leave 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not be in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded in the inland provinces or stranded in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the U.S. and the unemployment rate may drop to 32% as estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Many million migrant workers have become unemployed (paid through daily wages) due to the lockdown in India. Angus Reed Institute’s survey found that 44% of Canadian families experienced some sort of unemployment. 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since going to the lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal debt scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on government-provided short-term working plans called Kurzarbet.
The German short-term work compensation plan has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been heavily influenced by the pandemic, affecting organizations’ operations globally, as well as both individuals working and acting independently.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector attempted to maintain their (often publicly funded) mission to provide the community access to cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and where possible, support the artists.
As of March 2020, in the world and in varying degrees, museums, libraries, display locations, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, celebrations, and performances to be cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Lately another and the rapid growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting ceremonies, and other social gatherings, such as music festivals and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruptions. The Vatican announced that the Holy Week observations in Rome, which take place during the last week of Lent’s Christian mourning session, have been cancelled.
Many bishop-sectors have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than present extensively on Sundays; some churches have provided church services through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With Rome’s Roman Catholic bishop-region closing its churches and prayers and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, Jewish synagogues, temples, and gurudwaras and limited public ceremonies.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later the shrines were closed, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as civilians into holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has created the most significant disruption to the sports calendar around the world since World War II.
Most of the major sporting events, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics scheme, which was originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will be rescheduled “at a date ahead of 2020 but not ahead of the summer of 2021”. Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
Due to this, many gamblers are adopting the online method, in which a significant increase in the rates of new sign-ups has been reported in many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, in which various music groups have suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many big theatres such as Broadway ones also suspended all the performances.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming of concerts to promote artists’ performance, distribution, and their work or creating a web-based “function”.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the growing bias, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, the U.S. and other countries have been noted.
Fear, suspicion and hostilities have been reported in many countries, especially Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
In information from February (when most cases were still limited to China), racist sentiments of being able to receive viruses or receiving just punishments of Chinese people in different groups around the world have been documented.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and for people from virus-prone areas.
After the outbreak progresses in new hotspot countries, the first countries in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19. The citizens of countries, including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Initially, the citizens of China signed petitions to prevent people from entering their countries in an effort to prevent this disease.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan in Japan became popular on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the US, have reported rising levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referencing coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", which was considered anti-racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign vacuum people from Wuhan to Novi Sangehar.
Students coming from Northeast India, which is bordered with China, who study in major Indian cities, have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s state unit in West Bengal, said that the Chinese have destroyed nature and “so God has taken revenge on them.”
In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents got a boost from the pandemic, with foreigners described as targeted for “foreign garbage” and “settlement”, the Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remark.
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or whole of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers provided scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods to detect the presence of the virus and detect the antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed only to detect the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (blood hematology) can be used both for diagnosis and for people monitoring.
Detectives show how many people have been diagnosed, including those whose symptoms were very mild to inform or who were symptomless.
The results of this test can determine the exact death rate of the disease and the level of collective resistivity in people.
Due to limited checks, no country had reliable data on the spread of viruses among people as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had checked more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities on how much has been checked in different countries.
This inequality is also likely to significantly affect the mortality rate of reported cases, which are significantly more likely to be estimated in some countries.
By using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), respiratory samples received by various methods, including samples of nasograsny fah or mucus can be checked.
Normally the results become available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR investigations carried out with the throat hearers are only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later the virus may disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people checked in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the inside by suction catheters or the material ( mucus) in the coughing can be used.
One of the initial PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed in Charité in January 2020, in Berlin, and became the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test kit by January 23, 2020. Cogan Biotech, a South Korea company, developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to get approval for emergency use of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 check kits from China’s National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panels to public health laboratories via International Reagent Resource.
The older versions of the test kits found inexhaustible results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests, and caused problems with checking on CDC in Atlanta; this caused the average of samples successfully processed throughout February 2020 to be less than 100 samples a day.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 Feb 2020 and until then state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate the investigation.
The investigation was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authority. Professional laboratories in the US started checking in early March 2020.
As of 5th March 2020, Labcorp announced the nationwide availability of COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics provided COVID-19 testing across the country till 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; the aggregation and processing of samples must be carried out according to the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
This test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare on 11 Feb 2020. It was reported to develop tests to detect the COVID-19 infection of Myo Clinic on 12 March 2020. Rosh Diagnostics was allowed from the FDA for a high amount of tests that can be carried out within 3.5 hours on 13 March 2020, resulting in about 4,128 tests from one machine over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authority (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for investigation on Abbott’s m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorities to Holologic, Labcorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020 the same way Sheffield received the EUA from the FDA for a check that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are about 18000 such machines in the U.S. currently and Abbott wants to increase manufacturing for 50,000 tests every day. A test kit is being developed in Taiwan that uses monoclonal immunity that specifically connects with the Novel Coronavirus’ nucleocapsid protein (N protein), with the hope that it can result in intense influenza testing in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that “the chest radiograph has less clinical importance in the early stage, while CT [computerized tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms.”
Typical features of CT include bilateral multilober ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effects of subpleural, crazy pawing and consolidation develop.
The study comparing PCR to CTs in Wuhan, the source point of the current pandemic, has suggested that the CT’s multiple illustration characteristics are similar to other pneumonia and disease processes, despite being less specific, it is remarkably more sensitive than PCR.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “CT should not be used as a check or first-line check for diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, CDC recommends PCR for primary check.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of immunity, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine the resistivity that starts in individuals from 7 days or around after the onset of symptoms and to detect infection to monitor people. Tests can be checked in central laboratories (CLTs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automatic systems with high throughput in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although a series of specimens can be used to see the resistive response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from the skin puncture.
The FDA on 26 March 2020 designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when required and are thus now able to distribute their immunization tests.The FDA has approved the first step of the PCR test.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authority. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Aptop Diagnostics got Europe’s approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and IgA immunity to the virus in blood samples.
Within a few hours there is the ability to check hundreds of samples and therefore it is much faster than the traditional PCR test of the viral RNA.
In early April, the UK found that any immunization test kits they purchased were not good enough to be used.
Hong Kong planned in which suspected patients can stay at home, “The emergency department will provide the sample tube to the patient”, they will spit back into it and get the result of the investigation in a short time. The British NHS announced that they are starting to plan to investigate suspicious cases at home, which removes the risk of infecting others of the patient if he goes to the hospital or removes the risk of disinfecting used ambulances.
In Germany, the National Association of Statuery Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the ability to perform around 12,000 tests daily in the ambulatory setting and conducted 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the check-up is ordered by the doctor, the cost is raised by health insurance.
Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week, according to the president of Robert Coach Institute.
Drive-through tests were offered in many big cities until March 19.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey observed that as of week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were checked including week 12/2020 and 33,491 (6.9%) samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, the researchers at Technian and Renbum Hospital developed and tested the method of checking samples from 64 patients at once, further investigating. In Wuhan, a 2000 square meter temporary emergency search laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese language: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was launched on 5 February 2020, which could process more than 10,000 samples a day.
Taking another 5 days with the supervision of construction by Wang Jian, founder of BGI, it has been seen in the model that if the ability to check this was not launched, the number of cases in Hubei would be 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
Wuhan Laboratory has been immediately followed by Huo-Yen laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities all over China.
As of 4th March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests every day. The frameworks of the open source, multiplexed by Origami Esse, have been released, which can use 93 tests to check for samples of as many as 1122 patients as COVID19. These balanced frameworks can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Before March, the drawbacks and insufficient quantities of reagents became a problem in large-scale checks in the EU, the UK, and the US.
This led some writers to explore protocols for sample preparation that include heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for up to 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing its population more than any other country for coronavirus per capita, and on the path to raising the level of checks to reach a larger level of population.
This was due to the combination of drive-through testing capability and the purchase of a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency check labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is able to perform thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to work out such a large level outside China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent Germany’s method of manufacturing kits to self-develop low-income countries with lack of resources.
Germany’s method was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. The outbreak initially had problems on the reliability of the test kits between China and the United States and were unable to supply sufficient kits to meet the demand for investigation and recommendations by the country and Australia health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of checks in South Korea helped reduce the spread of the Novel Coronavirus.
The testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed by the South Korean government during several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the high demand for the virus to spread at a wider level, thousands of outstanding tests in private U.S. laboratories were piled up and the supply of vehicles and chemical reagents became stressful.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its probe kits.
In the United States, there was a “decrease” in the test kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private checks. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeg Biotechnology Co. Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm pointed out that incorrect results could be due to a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the mischecking kits and replace it with the second check kit made available by Shenzhen Bioeg. 80% of the check kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million check kits from China, which were not found to be accurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that these should be put into Danube. Turkey’s health ministry’s Ateş Kara said that the checking kits purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and they “not used them”. The UK that bought 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
After the investigation, the quarantine of those tested positive and the detection of people with positive SARS-CoV-2 came in contact with them received positive results.
In place of death from the first COVID-19 in Italy, researchers working in the Vò town in Italy checked twice on the entire population of about 3,400 people at a gap of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all those with discovered cases were quarantined.
New infections were completely eliminated by travel restrictions in and to and from the place to come.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has grown significantly slower than other developed countries in Singapore without aggressively detecting contacts, conducting internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantined, but forcing restrictions such as forced restaurant and retail establishments.
Many programs have been cancelled, and Singapore started advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but reopened on March 23 after school leave.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic by aggressively detecting contact, internal travel restrictions, checking and quarantined, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that have had more tests than death counts have a very low mortality rate, possibly because these countries are only more capable of detecting mild or unfettered people.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the ability to investigate and have limited experience on COVID-19 from national laboratories send one of their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmation checks.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the “% of the tested positive” column is affected by the country’s checking policy.
Being similar to other things, a country where only hospitalized people are checked will have a higher percentage of positive check-ups than a country where all citizens are checked, regardless of whether or not symptoms appear in them.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning your hands for the purpose of removing soil, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands regularly with soap at any "necessary moments" during a day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by mal-mouthed pathways.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five important moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's buttocks or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, and before and after feeding food preparation or consumption of raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Preparing food, during and after.
Before and after taking care of the sick person.
After changing the diaper or cleaning the baby using the toilet.
After sprinkling, coughing, or sneezing your nose.
After touching the animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Therapeutic hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to therapeutic processes.
Washing hands before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the disease from spreading.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to scrub pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for common people.
Washing hands has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reducing newborn infant mortality rates in cases of delivery at home.
A 2013 study showed that well handwashing practices in children under the age of five may improve their length a bit.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap can reduce infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhea related diseases.
This simple task can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Handwashing promoting measures can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and it is similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea cases may be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing is the only effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and intensive respiratory infections (ARI) as an automatic induced behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the globe.
A major ARI, Pneumonia, is the most prominent cause of death in children under the age of five, with an estimated 18 lakh children being killed every year.
About 35 lakh children die annually due to diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save lives more than any one vaccine or medical measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by about half and the number of deaths from intensive respiratory infections by up to one-quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other cleaning system measures as part of water, cleaning system and sanitation (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo that spreads through direct physical contact.
A small damaging effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, flaky skin conditions known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Too often hand washing is also seen as a symptom of psychotic-obligation disorder (OCD).
During the day there are five important times when washing hands with soap is important to reduce transmission by the mal-mouthed route of the disease: after using the toilet (urine immersion, bowel movement), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing nappies), before feeding the baby, and before preparing food or raw meat, fish, or poultry consumption.
Other opportunities when practicing the proper technique of washing hands to prevent the transmission of the disease are: before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or spraying your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching the waste.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; in the US with 77 percent; and this rate was the lowest in China with 23 percent. There are now many behavioral change methods available to increase the hand washing behavior with soap at critical times. There is an option in developing countries to wash mass by school children at certain times of the day to get used to hand washing.
The “essential health care program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of massive action to promote children’s health and education.
This national program involves cleaning teeth daily from the original fluoride as well as washing hands daily with soap, taking anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
It is better to remove microorganisms from the skin by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soap and detergent is to reduce obstacles in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an unskilled skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, sufficient flow of water helps in cleaning.
Due to repeated use, solid soaps may contain bacteria remaining from previous uses.
Some studies that look at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that there is no possibility of a transfer due to bacteria being washed with froth.
Nevertheless, according to the CDC, "soaps containing liquid soap spill feature on the palms are better" without touching them.
Emphasis has been preached on antibacterial soaps for the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as tricloson, with a comprehensive list of resistant breeds of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic-resistant breeds, they may not be as effective as they are promoted to be effective.
In addition to the agent that protects the humid and skin, refined formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), microbiologically active benzoic acid and other skin supplements (alovara, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health demonstrated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclos in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from hands.
Comfortable hot water to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria at body temperature (37 ° C) increase very fast.
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
However, unlike popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand disinfectant is a water-free base hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the rubbing alcohol waterless hand hygiene agent (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs, or hand sanitizer) started gaining popularity.
Most of these isopropyl are based on alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated with glycerin in a liquid or foam, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), or a humid, in a gel like thickening agent, for ease of use and to reduce the effect of drying alcohol.
Mixing dilute hydrogen-peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity.The hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers destroy bacteria, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers that contain 70% of alcohol destroy 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (similar to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and destroy 99.99% to 99.999% bacteria after 1 minute of application (4 to 5 logs reduction).Hand sanitizers are most effective to bacteria and are less effective to some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective to norovirus (or norwalk) type of viruses that are the most common cause of infectious gastrointestinal arthritis. Both hands should be used enough hand disinfectants or alcohol rubs to completely wet or cover them.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and the knuckles of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, froth or gel is dried.
Finger knuckles should also be washed thoroughly rubbed in both palms. The U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Center recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these reactants is based on their ease of use and quick destructive hyperactivity towards microorganisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin until lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The effect of drying alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by mixing glycerines and/or other lubricants in the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing lubricants significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Rarely allergic to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs have contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity.
The low tendency to induce contact dermatitis that bothered than washing hands with soap and water became an attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, unwatered agents do not clean organic substances with hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The efficacy of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on materials and formulations, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has possibly been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to progressive adverse skin reactions, the formulations using benzalconium chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial activations after applying them.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or clay can be more effective than water alone, but can be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it can increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce the spread of the disease.
Similar to soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it makes an alkaline solution in contact with water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap, if soap is not available.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because basins with stable water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Rub the proper amount of soap into the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more perfectly when using soap than water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing produces friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed by rubbing for a longer time.
Wash thoroughly under running water.
Washing in the basin can cause the hands to become contaminated again.
Dry with a clean towel or let it air dry.
Wet and damp hands become more easily recontaminated. The most missed areas are the area between the thumb, wrist, fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from getting dry; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap is not available, various low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing, for example pouring water from a hanging jar or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash. In conditions of limited water supply (such as school or rural area in developing countries), water-protection solutions are available, such as "tipping-taps" and other low-cost options.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique that uses a leg-operated lever to put a little amount of water on the jugs hung by the rope, and hands and soap sticks.
Drying hands effectively is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Research done in large quantities suggests that paper towels provide more hygiene than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the paper towel industry The European Tissue Symposium, aimed at comparing the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-aired hand dryers, and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After washing hands and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by 194% on average on the cushions of the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying with jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria by 42% on average finger cushions and 15% on palms.
After washing hands and drying with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by 76% on average on the cushions of the fingers and 77% on the palms. Scientists also tested to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in the ability to cross-contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment.
Jet-air dryer, which removes air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow micro-organisms from hands and units and possibly contaminate other toilet users and toilet environments up to 2 meters away.
Microorganisms spread from the dryer to 0.25 m using a hot air hand dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the calculation of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers present, and hand dryers are compared with drying from paper towels.
Washing hands using hand sanitizer wipes in the absence of soap and water during travel is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungary’s physician Ignaz Semelvis discovered its effectiveness in disease prevention in hospital environments (1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands when they forget.
Their use in a study has shown a reduction in the infection rate.
Therapeuticly, the hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using the proper amount of soap and water or gel to form froth and rub each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there are garbage under the nails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can stay in the water on the hands, it is important to wash well and wipe with a clean towel to dry.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
It prevents the re-contamination of the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in the health care system is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“germs”) and to prevent them from being transmitted.
According to The New England Journal of Medicine, not washing hands in most medical environments remains at unacceptable levels, in which a large number of physicians and nurses forget to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to the transmission of microorganisms.
A study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can lower the rate of catheter-related blood flow infection by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health care areas.
The documentation guidance of hand hygiene available by this organization can also be found on its website for public comments.
A relevant review was made by Witty and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if regulatory compliance performance is necessary.
The World Health Organization has set "five chances" to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before germicidal work, and
The addition of disinfectant chemicals to the soap ("medicinal" or "antimicrobial" soap) provides the antidote ability to the hand washing agent.
To 'rub' your hands for surgery rip-busting, having a tap that can be turned on and off without touching with hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfected towels to dry hands after washing, and another disinfected instrument for cleaning under a disinfected brush and nails, is necessary.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure normally requires washing hands and elbows for 2-6 minutes.
No need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the completion of the hand wash, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to use hand wash or hand disinfectant before and after the care of a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it has been found that the biggest benefit from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and when the frequency of hand cleaning had increased over 35%, there was little additional benefit.
By washing hands with plain soap, the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease is higher than that of washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing hand rub with alcohol-based solution for 30 minutes with washing hands with antibacterial soap, it turns out that rubbing hands with alcohol reduces the contamination of bacteria 26% more than that of antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs to reduce H1N1 influenza A virus and clostridium difficile spores by hand. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care arrangements may include education on hand washing to employees, increased availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to employees.
More research is required on which of these measures are most effective in various healthcare systems.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is considered an economical, essential means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal hand washing behavior is a challenge from the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people’s homes, schools, and workplaces.
For example, in most rural Africa every private or public toilet has very few hand washing taps, even though cheap options exist to make hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rate may also be due to cast habits rather than due to lack of soap or water.
The promotion and support of hand washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about changes in the long-term behaviour of the population.
In order for it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation is necessary.
A systemic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social propaganda campaigns are less effective. One example for promotion of handwashing in schools is the “three star method” by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, cheap steps to ensure that students wash hands with soap, along with other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
Making hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotional campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-enhancing campaign that aims to try to bring about a change in behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of an emoji of hand washing.
Some studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries regarding the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health - especially those with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth to a child or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified by two promoters of hand hygiene in the middle of the 19th century: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, English who is the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people believed that infections were caused by a foul smell called Miasmus.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to increase hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The Swine Flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases in many countries.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung in Germany near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and toilets in airports.
The phrase "washing your hands" from something means declaring your unwillingness to take responsibility for that thing or to accept collusion in it.
It derives from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate himself was separated from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very wide use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing his hands compulsorily in an attempt to clean up a fictional stain, which shows his criminal conscience about his crimes committed by him and his husband about motivating him to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or contemplating unethical actions, wash hands more often than others, and attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" compensatory tasks such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both sanitary and symbolic purposes. Hand washing with soapless water to wash hands is also a part of washing hands to provide hygiene, especially in some works. Religions recommend washing hands with symbolic hand washing with soapless water including Baahi Dharma, Hinduism, Tevil in Judaism and Netillat Yadayim, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vazu in Islam.
It is mandatory to wash hands after using toilets in Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam religion.
And, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam religion.
Control of the dangers of spreading COVID-19 infection at the workplace
Control of the dangers of spreading COVID-19 infection at work, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there are applications of occupational safety and health practices for the control of threats.
The risk of spread of disease at work depends on proper control, workplace and task to be performed, which are based on risk assessment of sources of contact, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors of individual personnel who are more prone to COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk tasks have minimal business contacts with people and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, following respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting work environments.
Moderate contact risk functions are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not aware of or suspected to have a COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, the risk control measures for this group include: the use of a high-efficiency air filter, the use of sneeze guard, and the maintenance of personal protective equipment available for the situation if the person with COVID-19 is faced.
OSHA considers those health workers and dead-home personnel to be at high contact risk who are exposed to a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to become high contact risk if personnel perform procedures that produce aerosols on a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, or collect or handle samples from them.
Controls of hazards appropriate to these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure convection chambers and personal protective equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks within the workplace can have many effects.
Personnel may be absent from work due to the need to get sick, take care of others, or fear of potential contact.
What goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as short demand time or delivery or shopping through on-the-go services), can change the nature of the business in relation to both.
Finally, the movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be affected. Preparation and response plans for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
Plans address levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job functions, including risk factors arising from source of risk, home and community arrangements, and risk factors of individual personnel such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls necessary to address the risks and contingency plans for circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of response to an outbreak includes: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people with high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in a community with a place of business affects the reactions to be followed.
The sequence of hazards’s controls is a structure that is widely used to group hazards’s controls according to occupational safety and effectiveness in health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective control engineering controls, followed by administrative control and finally personal protection tools.
Engineering controls include separating employees from work-related hazards without depending on the worker's behavior, and this can be the most economical solution in implementing.
Administrative control functions are changes in policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain contacts.
Personnel must be selected all kinds of PPE based on danger, properly planted (e.g., respirator), worn continuously and properly inspected, maintained, and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored, or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk tasks have minimal business contacts with people and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and thoroughly washing hands, encouraging personnel to stay at home if they are sick, providing respiratory etiquettes covering cough and sneeze, vessels of tissue and waste, preparing for remote or orange lobes if necessary, discouraging personnel from using tools and equipment of others, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting work environments.
Early identification and separation of potential infectious persons at work is an important step for the safety of personnel, customers, visitors, and others.
The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they are free from fever, fever signs, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-changing drugs, and that the policies of the disease leave are flexible, allowing employees to stay at home for the care of a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk actions include actions that require frequent or close contact with people within six feet (1.8 meters) who are not known or suspected to have contracted COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the commercial space, or because the person has recently made an international trip to a location with extensive COVID-19 transmission.
These include personnel who are exposed to the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the convection rate, setting up physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and setting up drive-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick personnel to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up unneeded travel for ongoing COVID-19 outbreak locations, developing emergency communication plans, providing personnel with the latest education and training on COVID-19 risk factors, providing workers with the way to use who need to use protective apparel and equipment, providing protection to use, providing protection of personal safety and work environments that promote personal hygiene, minimizing access to customers and other face-to-to-consultants, protective measures, minimizing access to workplaces and other face-to-to-to-consultants, and other face-to-to-to-arms, including protective measures and hands-to-to-to-to-to-to-hand-hand-hands.
Personnel in this risk group need the use of a sparsely respirator.
If a person falls ill on an airplane, proper controls for the safety of personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person from others by 6 feet, naming a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when taking care of the sick passenger or touching the body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing, potentially additional personal protective equipment should be worn.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, postpone travel when sick at the control of hazards and self-isolation and immediately inform the onboard medical center if a person develops fever or other symptoms while onboarding.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be performed in the individual’s room isolated. For schools and baby care facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building, irrespective of community transmission.
When there is a minimum to medium community transmission, social distancing making strategies can be applied, such as field visits, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or cancelling meals in restaurants, increasing distance between desks, shortening arrivals and vacation times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with symptoms such as flu.
When there is enough transmission in the local community, extended school holidays can be considered in addition to social distancing making strategies.For law enforcement personnel doing daily law activities, immediate health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed COVID-19 or suspected individuals are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact while catching, personnel should clean and disinfect using household cleaning sprays or wipes, before re-using their duty belts and equipment, and follow the standard operating procedures for the retention and disposal of used PPEs and for the retention and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health care and dead-home personnel to be in high or ultra-high categories of contact risk.
High-contact risk tasks include providing health care, assisting, laboratory, and medical transport personnel who are exposed to known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
These become very high contact exposures if personnel perform procedures that produce aerosols on known or suspected patients of COVID-19, collect or handle samples from them.
The processes that produce aerosols include duct penetration, phlegm induction processes, bronchoscopy, certain dental procedures and examinations, or collecting specimens from rip-busting.
High contact risk morgue functions involve people who prepare the body of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk factors if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include separation chambers for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during performing aerosol generating processes.
Specific negative pressure condensation may be appropriate in some health care and murga-house arrangements.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into different waiting areas, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case. Other than PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol generating processes.
In the US, N95 filtering facepiece respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in terms of comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-test, training, and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the worker.WHO does not recommend coveralls, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through physical fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the entrance location.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without producing any aerosols, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles facial shield, chonga, and gloves.
If an aerosol generating process is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with the N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical constraints such as transparent windows, allowing only people involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE required for specific work, using the same respirator without removal during the care of many patients with the same diagnosis, inspecting and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for paranoid individuals.

Topic: [Covid-19] Lightening weight and preparing for the future
Remittance Date/Time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: No rights reserved
We have extraordinary situations around us this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear to all humans in the world to be interconnected and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community promotion, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of camaraderie we have seen among all our co-workers over email, call, and chat proves in exceptional ways how fortunate we have been to work with extraordinary humans.
I am so grateful and proud to all of you as co-workers that I cannot tell in words.
Last week a man shared praise for our work with me.
He reminded me how meaningful it is to be able to turn the world to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to remain available to all and online to this extremely important resource.
Your work makes it possible, whether you keep the sites running or the source of our co-workers’ salaries or keep our communities safe.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and now the most needed.
This is a moment in which our work, and our way of doing it, will have a meaningful impact on both worlds.
Due to the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some notable changes to how we work with us from this upcoming week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our method and prepare a schedule of days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate reaction in our approach to the situation before us, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve stress and support our mission for a long time.
If you have to subtract your work, there is nothing wrong with it.
For all staff, contractor, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours per week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you're able to function more than normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, at this time the world is unpredictable, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, bring groceries, or go to a doctor, your skill is our priority.
We are not keeping track of your time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It doesn't need to be said, but we're saying this.
No disease leave or PTO needed - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to make sure the main areas of work are seen.
(If you have confirmed COVID-19, please let Brian of T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that your situation is taken into account by management.)
Hour-wise personnel will get full salary.
We have already said, and we are once again expressing our commitment to fulfill our pledges to our contractors and hourly staff co-workers.
Everyone will receive a salary based on his common working hours during normal circumstances.
You will still get a salary if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way out of the tension around the world.
What we can do can be extremely gratifying, especially at such a time.
Once again, self-care is most important by you.
We have to say that you talk to your manager, so that we know what to expect, and then we can change accordingly.
Some works are considered urgent.
There are a few things that we can’t let stop.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Security, and Grant Accumulation Teams (and others) perform very important tasks that may require additional collaboration.
We will start a process with all departments to assess existing objectives and focus our attention on cooperating with essential things for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will focus all just on the most necessary projects.
Decreasing the pace now will save us from injury later.
We have no plans to “give double the time to compensate” after the global pandemic has passed.
You will no longer be expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that have gone beyond reality.
We believe that the circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new goals and deadlines where appropriate.
What will happen with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To be adjusted with our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we want to tweak the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that will give us more time to budget so that employees can prioritize their over-critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones, and accommodate those who need to work or want to work on the decreased schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline will bring a significant reduction in our current planning workload and pressure across the organization.
We will place our proposal in front of the board of directors next week and we will inform the representatives and teams about further steps as soon as we get confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office conditions, contacts, and cleaning
Last week we came to know that one of our SF-based peer has probably come in contact with the COVID-19 virus.
However, with a lot of caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office.
She disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank that comes to our floor with a hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
Its own care-duty protocol is being implemented using products that aid the safety of its inhabitants in the building.
We believe that the office will be completely ready when we return.
Our DC Office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC Office had adopted a completely remote system in conformity with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also a discussion going on to lease a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but these may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/away for the first time.
Our colleagues working from home/away for a long time would need adjustments to know, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the meetings time to more than an hour or two.
If a longer session is necessary, consider distributing them in several days.
Define meetings clearly, keep the agenda ready, and send reading materials in advance.
Make videos your default choice with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and combining.
Take the initiative to facilitate every meeting, monitor a chat for questions and keep track of the speaker list, and help a person take notes (or take notes in collaboration)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to Tech Support.
Use your health reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoteies channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work delivered.
The HR Operations team is investigating webinar-based labor efficiency guidance to collaborate in the growth of work delivered throughout the foundation.
This last week, we asked all customers who received community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as Editathon, etc., until the WHO announced the end of the global pandemic.
We let them know that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions can make it impossible to carry out their mutual grant activities, and that no one will be punished to be forced to delay or amend those goals.
In this upcoming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding the Wikimedian and other regional and thematic community conferences.
This impediment makes the whole global community witness a sense of suffering, but they also have a sense of clarity and a sense of ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia, and otherwise.
Moving forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the mate-wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contacts about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find information from this email at the office wiki, and all other essential COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at the moment.
If you have anything to ask about a travel, program, a major working stream, or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with the CRT.
We exist to help provide support and establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send email to HR Director of International Global Operations Brian Judean.
None of these changes should be seen as a abandonment of our actions and obligations.
Rather, they are recognized that at this time, there is a possibility of our work and obligations needed to be adapted as we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to assist each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the cooperation they need, and provide service to the service the world depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
At the moment, this is the time to assist each other, and to make room for important work that will take place in the coming weeks and potentially upcoming months.
We need all of you to make it possible, and so we want all of you to take care of yourself and your families, so that you can be at your best when you need it.
Now, please wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doren D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Linette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant Eye, Heather W, Jaime V, Jenine Yu, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the enzyme connected to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
By reducing the amount of ACE2 angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7) balances the activation of the associated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which makes it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the end-level and surface of other cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminal peptides M2 domain and the C-terminal lectrin renal amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a one-time-pass type I membrane protein with an enzymaticly active domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is decomposed from the cross membrane domain by another enzyme called Shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood flow and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membranes of lung type II alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, artery and vein interlevel cells and the soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
The ACE2 mRNA appearance is also found in the cerebral valkut, strietum, hypothalamus, and brain column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE decomposes angiotensin I hormone into vasodivalent angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from Angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and water-decompose it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2[des-Arg9]-Bredykin can also decompose many other peptides, including apelin, neurotensin, diorphin A, and grelin.
ACE2 also controls the membrane transport of the nostalgic amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and its role is stated in Hartnup disease.
As transmembrane protein, ACE2, HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus generating SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus generating COVID-19) serves as the main entry point in cells for certain coronaviruses, including.
More specifically, connecting to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells of the thoracic S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 leads to both the transfer of viruses and enzymes to the endosomes located within the cells.
This admission process also requires nutritive serine proteas to provoke S protein by TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapy. Some people have envisaged that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells can help fight infection.
However, many professional entities and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
The methodical review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors compared to the controls was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34%."
Also, "The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in people with trauma and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality rate, although the results were less dominant than the overall risk of pneumonia".
The recombinant human ACE2 is considered new therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in boar infants with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-age of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the beginning of the action with a 24-hour effect process (period) is 30 minutes.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. RhACE2, distilled in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, has been evaluated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been exposed to an infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government assistance in certain areas and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for building contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Low interdisciplinary options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to another cellphone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app “StopKorona!” to explore contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, this app was waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks. Ireland and France also employed a similar app (“StopCovid”).
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to offer a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t get out of the house.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of possible practical problems with app-based systems, including a possible lack of effectiveness if the use of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited only to "official" or otherwise reputable organizations to determine what types of organizations can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy Campaigners have expressed their concern about the implications of large-scale surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed after this threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement to the limitations on such surveillance.
Organizations declared eight terms on government projects:
Monitoring has to be "valid, required, and proportionate";
There should be the closing clause for the expansion of supervision and monitoring;
The use of data must be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and displayed protected based on proof;
Avoid promoting discrimination and deprivation of digital surveillance;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
measures to safeguard citizens’ rights to abuse and to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and the Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Ohn Grenadines) (RSF) have also released checklists, which will require "meaning participation" by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of frequent monitoring by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal space data; many privacy-protection systems have been created that only use central servers for interconnected communication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notification through text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws after MERS outbreaks in that country.
This information is available to the public through many applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, these details were not released yet.
Privacy-protection contact tracing with a large body of research literature since at least 2013 is a well established concept.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity to other cellphones of a user.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that involves both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy-protection proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly contact event numbers, CEN), privacy sensitive protocols, and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never goes out of the device, and all are on the matching device.
The Privacy Group in MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for collecting and using privacy-protection technologies when collecting and using location or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020.The similar effort is by Enigma MPC, the company that develops privacy technology, which was originally established in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was established by groups that essentially organized in terms of the same approach and large-scale similar protocols, aiming to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and warning apps, which was an important aspect of achieving widespread adaptation.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, Android and iOS mobile platform controlling companies, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-preservative cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main techniques used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is intended to be made available in three steps:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protection coronavirus tracing app
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android
Medication restoration (also known as drug repurposing, reprofiling, reappointing or remedial change), for which it was originally developed, is the reuse of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition different from that.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research instructions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusions related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides the proper project of developing effective antiviral medication to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like proteases, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helixes, S proteins, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein and others studied several candidate compounds, which then adapted and analyzed for the similarity of their structure with the most uniform approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2-anti-drug in pre-clinical studies recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is a anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain self-immune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine, will be among the four drugs studied as part of Solidarity clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cumo announced that tests of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in New York State will begin on March 24.On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquil phosphate under the Emergency Use Authority (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA’s procedure of clinical trials and is authorized only under the EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for contraception or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Physicians have said that they are using the drug when there is "no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a short study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langon Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipiravir "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted on 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of patients received Favipiravir and half received Omiphenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very low and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy medicine from Japan for its reserves, and use the military to deliver medicine to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug. This drug can be less effective in critical cases of the disease, where the virus has already been proven.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of Antiviral Lopinavir and a combination of Ritonavir, Lopinavir/ Ritonavir (Caletra), concluded that “no profit was seen”.
The drugs were made to prevent the hostage from replicating HIV from proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the proteas of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms about directing resources for the repurpose of drugs that develop specifically for HIV/AIDS within the scientific community.
WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was produced and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marberg virus infections.Giliad Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activation for protection from many Philo-, Pneumo-, Paramixo- and corona-viruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-test studies show that Remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several clinical trials going on, including two tests conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for those with moderate illness and the other for those with a more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of Intravenous Vitamin C for hospitalization and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
The state of New York began testing for antibiotic agithromycin on 24 March 2020.

A phase II test of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is going on with 200 patients admitted from serious, hospitalization cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of cholchisin in reducing the flow and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study named COLCORONA is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 and older who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anti-asymptomatics are being tested in Italy.
Heparin with low molecular weight is being widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian drug agency has published guidelines on its use.
A multicentral study on 300 patients who research on the use of anoxaparin sodium on prophylactic and curative doses was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the repurpose of approved anti-viral drugs, which were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umiphenovir: Umiphenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment as per the guidelines of the Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as possible reusable as COVID-19 treatments are:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 Receptor): Approved by China.
Test in Italy and China too. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccines have completed clinical trials, many attempts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it is not expected to be available in less than 18 months of a vaccine for protection from SARS-CoV-2, a disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop the vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection from SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in April, CEPI Initiative’s imperatives for vaccine development are pace, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning, and global learning.
In April, CEPI scientists informed that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the introduction of 2020 to create effective vaccines for protection from COVID-19.
Step I Security studies include advanced key platform goals:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral Vector (Phase I Developer and Commentary Candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Type 5 Vectors)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the initial stage of development, out of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milecan Institute), and 37 others are declared, but less public information is available (as envisaged in being designed or planning).
Initial safety and immunization tests are performed in a Phase I-II test, this is usually done at random, placebo-controlled and multiple destinations, determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects on optimal doses, and testing vaccine effectiveness for disease prevention.
Out of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were still not in human evaluation (still were in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 Jan 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify the viral protein to induce immune response.
Around 24 Jan 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at Saskatchewan University announced the start of work on a vaccine aiming to start human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 Jan 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 Jan.
Around 29 Jan 2020, the Yansen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schutemaker, announced that it had started working on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vakart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership to develop the vaccine with Vaxart.
On 8 Feb 2020, laboratory oncogen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technology used for neoantigen immunization therapy of cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they have finalized the synthesis of vaccines and are starting testing.
On 27 Feb 2020, Nugenerex Immuno-Oncology, a Genrex subsidiary, announced that they were launching a vaccine project to create a lye-key peptide vaccine for protection from COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate who could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects for developing a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, both the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Datric and the Walter Read Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in the development and manufacture of vaccines
NovaVax Inc. will work together.
Partners announced plans for preclinical testing and a phase I clinical trial as of July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 detractors, and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a quick path.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of coronavirus similar particle under partial financing from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in lab research, which has a human trial plan for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian informed that US President Donald Trump had offered Curvack "large sums for special learning of the COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government opposed.
On 17 March 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Tacis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that their final vaccine candidate could be started to fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced the investment of USD 4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research association, including Institute Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and University of Pittsburgh, which makes the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development to USD 29 million.
Other investment partners of CEPI for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavac, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in financing for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used if there were other coronavirus outbreaks, with plans to set up a particular COVID-19 vaccine to develop C$192 million.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing for a possible COVID-19 vaccine PittCoVacc in rats, which states that "MNA provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have induced antigen-specific antibody reactions [in rats], which had become clear to begin 2 weeks after vaccination."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in Canada announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities submitted resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in conjunction with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have asymmetrical effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have additional benefits to the disease they prevent.
Another randomized test in Australia is asking 4,170 health personnel to be admitted.
It is possible that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research that assesses vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate the need for bio-security level 3 enhancement measures to combat live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS treatment was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection from MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was assumed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-MERS-S.
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was aware of and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other breeds of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and exhalation.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell sensation, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days but it can also range from two to fourteen days.
Although in most cases the symptoms are mild, in some cases viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure develop.
As of 17 April 2020, over 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in over 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads between people during close contact, often through small droplets generated from coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets arise when exhaling, they normally fall off on the ground or on surfaces rather than contagious in the long distance.
People may also be infected by touching a dirty surface and later touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and at later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from the fah of a nasogrescence.
It is recommended to use masks for people who suspect they are infected with the virus and also for their caretakers.
The recommendations of the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some recommend their use, and others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries of all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be paralytic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, waking difficulty, and getting face or lips blue; it is advisable to get immediate medical care when these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat can be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases of China, only chest tightness and sharp beating were initially observed.
In some cases, the disease can increase to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the origination period.
The emergence period for COVID-19 is normally five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals developing symptoms develop within 11.5 days of infection. Notifications show that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these paralytic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they can contribute to the proliferation of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms are currently unknown and are being studied, which the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has informed that 20% of all confirmed cases remain unsympathetic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China on 1 April began to incorporate emphatic cases into its daily affairs; 130 out of 166 infections that day (78%) were emphatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can have a large amount of viral.
Talking in a louder voice produces more drops than talking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncapped coughs can produce drops going up to 4.5 m (15 ft).
Although this virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Science reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors engaged in corridors outside people's rooms came positive for viral RNA.
Respiratory secretions due to certain medical procedures such as duct insertion and cardiovascular pulmonary therapy (CPR) can lead to aerosols and thus airborne proliferation.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, this risk is considered low. This virus is the most contagious when people are symptomatic; although the spread is possible before the symptoms emerge, it has a low risk.
The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily this disease spreads, a person in general infects two to three other persons, which virus survives on surfaces for hours to days.
In particular, the virus was found to be traceable on cardboard for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products deactivate them by dissolving the fatty protective layer of viruses, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization began.
Among the five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral volume, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral volume on the second day of the test.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first separated by three people with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the respective coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed with household soap, which breaks down its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 as virus enzymes reach nutrient cells through angiotensin-convertive enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant of lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "kantak" (peplomer) to connect with ACE2 and enter the nutrient cell.
Hospitalization in Wuhan, China, was found to cause acute heart damage among 12% of infected people and it is more common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high due to the somatic migratory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly manifested in the heart and involved in heart function.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venus thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which can be related to poor disease diagnosis. Diagonal alveolar damage (DAD) in the autopsy examinations of people who died from COVID-19 and lymphocyte-rich larvae external substances within the lungs have been found.
Although SARS-CoV-2 contains a follow-up to the ACE2-disclosure epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of bodily overflow.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretary T-cells were shown to correlate with the selection of ingestive IL-6-secretary monosites in COVID-19 patients and with severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published a number of test protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is normally performed on respiratory samples obtained by a NASAgrasny’s fah; however, a nasal fah or mucus sample can also be used.
Results are normally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples to be taken in a two-week interval and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish a genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by viruses.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect the active infection and whether a person was formerly infected) were in development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test has shown that the purity is merely 60 to 70%.
FDA in the U.S. approved testing at the first care-of-location on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month.The clinical guidelines issued by the University of Wuhan’s Zhongnan Hospital pointed out ways to detect infections based on clinical facilities and pandemic-related risk.
Bilateral multifaceted ground-glass ambiguities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in the initial transition.
Subplural dominance, crazy pawing (frequent wall thickening with variable alveolar fillers), and densification may appear as the disease progresses.
There are fewer statistics available about COVID-19’s nuanced lesions and disease body function.
The main pathological findings obtained from the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Pulmonary disease, pericarditis, pulmonary densification and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia severity:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte overgrowth, large amorphous pneumocytes, intracranial inflammation with lymphocytic endopsis and polycentric giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: radiate alveolar damage (DAD) with radiated alveolar leakage.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe short-oxygenary.
Treating Pneumonia: Administration of leaks and pulmonary interoculation fibrosis in alveolar cavities
Blood: Circulating Endocrine Skandan (DIC); leukerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water frequently and for at least 20 seconds, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if the tissue is not available.
Proper hygiene of the hand is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has partly recommended the use of fabric coverings in public systems to limit transmission by paranoid individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure to individuals infected with large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling large public gatherings.
The guidelines for creating distance also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away.
There is no medicine known to be effective to prevent COVID-19. Since at least the vaccine is not expected until 2021, an important part of the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, called “reducing the curve”.
CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands appear dirty, before eating and after spraying their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Additionally, it recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is produced by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacteria spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand-proofing".
Glycerol is mixed as a humid.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing support to fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected to be infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assistive treatments can be useful in people with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to take care of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the U.S., intacivists and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free source, IBCC.
As of April 2020, no specific COVID-19 treatment is available.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care systems, when processes such as duct insertion or hand salvage are carried out to produce aerosols.
For health workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, CDC recommends keeping the person in an Airborne Infection Separation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions. CDC outlines guidelines for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended tools are: PPE robes, respirators or facial masks, eye protection equipment, and therapeutic gloves. When available, respirators (rather than facial masks) are preferred.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial arrangements, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Experimental Authority (EUA).
They are made to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but the effectiveness towards a specific biological agent is not entrenched for non-approved experiments.
CDC recommends using facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks if the mask is not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical moderation or other options, but in some percentage cases.
The type of respiration aid for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, with some evidence that nozzles penetration can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether one of these two provides the same benefits to critically ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use penetration mechanical convection when available because this technology limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years old and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of sufficiently severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were recruited into intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for offspring, and 1.4% died.
In China, around 30% of hospitalization people with COVID-19 have finally been admitted to ICU.
Mechanical convection becomes more complex as rapid respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and providing oxygen becomes increasingly difficult.
The pressure control systems and ventilators capable of high PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing lung damage associated with ventilators and the risk of pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may develop by 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive testing.
Antiviral medication can be attempted in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to take part in tests of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA has temporarily allowed health beneficial plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to a person’s life.
On this, necessary clinical studies have not been carried out to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to combat the outbreak of this disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
This app is able to detect the potential risk of infection by detecting ‘close contact’ using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities.Large data analyses for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracing, and artificial intelligence are used for tracing infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to trace mobile phone data of suspected coronavirus people.
This measure was done to enforce the quarantine and protect those exposed to infected citizens.
In addition, Deutsche Telecom in March 2020 shared phone location data combined with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, to prevent the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect those who violated quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said that he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Also President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid made a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may experience a crisis due to the fear of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or self-infection.
Growing social segregation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress, and an economic downturn are a perfect storm damaging the mental health and well-being of people,” the BBC quoted Rory O’Connor.
This disease may have a milder process with or without some symptoms similar to common colds such as other common upper respiratory tract diseases.
Mild cases normally recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or severe diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Depending on the data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may have a high risk of serious infections with COVID-19, but there is a decrease in statistics for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
Among the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can develop rapidly in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, patriarchal trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include brunt, abnormal scant, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Skandan abnormalities, especially the increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while 4% of this group sees abnormal kidney function.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transamines).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset and death of symptoms was ten days, in which five days were spent in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate in men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate in women was 1.7%.
Tissue pathology examinations of lung samples of carcass-examination reflect the aerocellular damage radiated with cellular fibromyoxide leakages in both the lungs.
Pneumocytes had seen viral cell pathology changes.
The lung picture appeared similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by a high level of troponin or a cardiac arrest.
According to U.S. March data, 89% of those admitted to the hospital had pre-existing conditions. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic condition of an area can also affect the mortality rate.
Death rate estimates from the situation vary due to those regional differences and also due to system-related difficulties.
Mortality rate can be overestimated due to low calculation of mild cases.
However, the fact that death is the result of pre-death cases could mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than non-smokers and were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term prolapse symptoms of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% drop in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans expressed organ damage.
It can also cause post intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown if the previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Depending on the behavior of other coronaviruses, immunity is seen as possible, but positive test cases for coronavirus have been reported at the date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse of an unresolved infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is considered to be a beast originating from natural and animal to human through infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was stated to be 1 December 2019.
The WHO official publications described the earliest beginning of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are normally used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, early outbreaks by the past time and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO determined the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemicly diagnosed COVID-19 without a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by the laboratory. The death-case ratio shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a certain time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.9% (153,82/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which refers to the percentage of persons diagnosed with a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) that shows the percentage (diagnosed and not diagnosed) of persons infected with a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of the immunity can lead to information about how many people have been infected.
At the heart of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglion d'Eda, in a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already been dead.
At the gangel, this disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, which reduced the relatively fatality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths could have been formally classified.
In addition, the German health system does not creek.
In the Netherlands, around 3% can be immune, according to the assessment from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) has been confirmed to die from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies conducted in China and Italy have higher mortality rates in men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is low only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 per cent and for women 1.7 per cent.
The exact causes of this gender-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors can be a cause.
Gender-based immunological differences, low prevalence of smoking in women, and co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at an early age can contribute to higher mortality among men than women.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government is not keeping track of gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and are more likely to get exposed to their virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 Feb 2020 that the official name of this disease would be "COVID-19".
The WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gabreysus reported that CO means corona, VI means virus, D means disease, and 19 means the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), species of animals, or group of people, that correspond to international recommendations for naming for the purpose of preventing degrading the virus that produces COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses the “COVID-19 Virus” and “Virus Responsible for COVID-19” in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, viruses and diseases were commonly called "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory disease, which complies with 2015 guidelines for not using locations in disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 Feb 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing parts of health materials such as Nasika Fah and ventilators.
In an example, when an Italian hospital immediately needed a ventilate valve, and the supplier was unable to provide in the required timeframe, a local startup printed the required 100 valves overnight by doing reverse-engineering.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, level of disease, prevention, treatment and other parties emerged and rapidly spread online.
Man appears to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studies failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no drug or vaccine approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization introduced a "solidarity trial" to assess the healing effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of efficacy.
There is no vaccine available at this time, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being checked.
First, researchers aim to build a complete virus vaccine.
The goal of the use of such viruses, whether inactive or dead, is to generate a quick immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain sub- fractions of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-kantak protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new technique of making the vaccine).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, a first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus causing the disease. Antibody dependent growth has been described as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted by April 2020.
Seven tests were evaluating an already approved treatment for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine stage III tests on Remdesivir in many countries scheduled to be reported by the end of April, reusable antiviral drugs are being served in most Chinese research.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of COVID-19 vaccines and clinical development for pharmaceutical candidates was underway. A number of existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Retonavir and combined with interferon beta Lopinavir/Retonavir.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence for the efficacy of Remdesivir is available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the U.S., China, and Italy. Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied with early results in China in February 2020.
However, there have been calls for an equivalent review of research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology noted, recommending the daily dose of one gram, that twice the dose is as dangerous and can be life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued permission for an emergency use for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The guidelines for the Chinese 7th edition also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenivarir for use to protect against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the suppression of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2.
The lower concentration of SARS-CoV-2 is recommended for further studies in organisms following the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) required for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 by the initial conjunct protein priming, interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without agithromycin have major limitations, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oslatmivir does not suppress artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in its COVID-19 treatment.
Increasing the amount of cytokine in the later stages of severe COVID-19 can be a complication.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties preventing increasing the amount of cytokine. Talkilizumb is included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a short study is completed.
It is undergoing phase 2 non-random testing nationally in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify increasing cytokine volume, it aims to face such growths, which are considered to cause death in some affected people.
The Interleukin-6 anti-grahi was approved by the FDA in 2017, on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractive cytokine discharge syndrome induced by CAR T cytology, a different reason.
There is no randomized, controlled evidence to date that Tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of pure and concentrated immunity produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being examined as a non-vaccinated method of inactivated vaccination.
This strategy was used for SARS with indecisive results.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated procedure, by which passive antibody therapy can mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using built-in monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health beneficial serum, which contains the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and is a specific immunity to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Lee Wenliang, a physician at the central hospital in Wuhan, who became infected with COVID-19 and died after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
