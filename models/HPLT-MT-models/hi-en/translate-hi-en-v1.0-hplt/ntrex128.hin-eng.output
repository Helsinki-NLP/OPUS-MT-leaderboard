Welsh AM (Assembly Member) is concerned with ‘images like mepet’
There is a hurdle among some members of the Assembly on the suggestion that their post should be titled as MWP (Member of Welsh).
This is because the name of the Assembly has been planned to be changed to the Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs associated with the scope of politics are concerned that it can make fun of them.
A Labour AM said that “it should not be linked to Twp and Pwp” the group was worried about this.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
A plaid AM said the whole group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A political party from Welsh said that its group was "independent" about the change of the name, but he noted that MWP could be mapped by an orally small change in words.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English pronunciation.
The currently drafting Assembly commission for change in the name said: “The final decision of any descriptor in regard to what the members of the assembly are called for will definitely be a case for the members of their own.”
According to the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission pointed out the results of public advice on proposals in which the Assembly had received a lot of support for the Welsh Parliament by renaming it.
In terms of the title of the AM post, the commission supported Welsh lawmakers or WMP, but found the most support MWP option in public advice.
Apparently, AM is suggesting many other options, but the presiding officer Elin Jones is having a lot of difficulty getting consensus, hoping that they will submit legal drafts for change within a few weeks.
The lawmaking being prepared for the changes will also include the second changes in the methods of work in the assembly, including the format of rules and committee systems for the disqualification of AMs.
AM will receive the last vote on the question of what they should be called upon when arguing for lawmaking.
The people of Macedonia are going to get the ballot collection to rename the country
On Sunday, voters will vote for whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The famous voting bid was made so that decades-old dispute with neighbouring country Greece could be settled, with a province also named Macedonia.
Athens has long been emphasizing that its northern neighbour’s name speaks about its province and has also objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO several times.
An opponent of the referendum on name change, the Macedonian president says they will ignore voting.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zeve, as well as supporters of the ballot collection, has argued that the change in the name is only a means to join the EU and NATO.
The noise of St. Martin's bells is becoming less because of the churches falling short in Harlem.
Mr. Adams said, “The elders I spoke to for history talk say that earlier there used to be bars and churches at every nook.”
Today, all is coming to an end."
He makes sense to be short of the bar.
Nowadays, people’s society is being formed differently,” he said.
The bars are no longer like the living room in the neighborhood where people go every day."
For the churches, they are worried that the money they get by selling the assets will not last as long as the leaders expected, "and soon these money will end or later they will come to exactly where they started from."
He further added that churches may have been converted into proprietary right apartment buildings that have a variety of people living in, who would not help keep the remaining places of worship safe.
He said, "In these buildings, the number of people who are buying a house built in it as a title and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because most of these people who are getting ownership in it will become members of these churches.
In 1870, a decade after St. Martin's, the two churches were built by gore people of religious society before Harlem became a Black Metropolis – Metropolitan Community.
The original whites of Methodist Religious Society moved into the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by black people of religious society who used to worship at nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was captured by a black religious society under the pastor John Howard Johnson who led to the removal of retailers on the 125th street, the place was the prime place for shopping in Harlem, here black people were opposed to hiring or promoting.
The building was badly damaged by the fire in 1939, but the hours began to be played here after Father Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson’s son and St. Martin’s successor, Pastor David Johnson, proudly called the work of playing the hour “opening the doors of luck to the poor.”
The hour-to-hour expert in July described it as something like this: it is “a cultural heritage” and “a precious historical instrument”.
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first hour in the world to be played by black composer Dionisio A. Lind, playing a huge hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merrivedar said that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Everything that happened in St. Martin in the past few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by the general leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
The Westry (where the goods of worship are kept) was empowered by parish (pastors of the locality) made of common leaders – in the province in July raised concerns over whether the province would “demand to meet the costs” for the Westry, regardless of whether it was involved in appointing craftsmen and contractors appointed to the Westry province.
Some of the pastors in the area complained to the province for lack of clarity.
Attack by a 13-year-old teen shark plowed while diving to catch the crab
Officials say that on Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old teenager, at the time he was holding a crab diving into California on Lobster season opening day.
The attack took place near the Beacon Beach of Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel from San Diego’s KSWB-TV said that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour, at the same time he heard a boy’s voice screaming for help and after that he reached out with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel told that earlier she felt like the boy has voiced the excitement of catching the crab, but then he realized that he was screaming, ‘I’m biting something!
I'm cutting something!'
Hammel told that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy’s whole thorn was torn.
Hammel said, “I made everyone’s voice to get out of the water: There’s a shark in the water!”
A teenager was admitted to the Ready Children Hospital in San Diego where his condition is said to be serious.
The attacking shark species have not been detected.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills said in a media talk that a few weeks ago a shark was detected in the area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Gills further said that the upper place of the victim’s torso is seriously injured.
For investigation and security purposes, authorities have stopped access to Casblad's Ponto Beach for 48 hours, from Essinitas's Swamis Beach to the Beach.
Gills reported that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans to Go to UK Beauty Market
The department is going to include store-styled boots, superdrugs, and debenhams by appointing expert assistants with Sainsbury's beauty products.
Despite continuing to decline in the sale of fashion goods and household goods, it is going to join the UK’s 2.8 billion pounds beauty market with good volumes, these large quantities of beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country and if the plan was successful, the turnover at more stores will be boosted next year.
Investments in beauty are being made in supermarkets, which aim to explore their place in the market after bringing in TV, microwave, and home furnishings.
Sainsbury's reported that bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time will double the product offered for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also resuming its boutique makeup products, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – this will increase its demand in small shoppers to some extent rapidly.
Additionally, the Perfume Retailer Fragrance Shop will also examine the exclusive feature in the two stores of Sainsbury's, the first of which was open last week at Croydon, South London and the second is set to open at the end of this year in Selley Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e. supermarkets, have been making more and more efforts to increase people's visits to shifts that reduce the selling volume of food items every day.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive at Sainsbury's, reported that people like department stores at the outlet will come up more quickly as supermarket chains are trying to confront Eldi and Lidl, the exponents with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's hundreds of stores have been installing Argos outlets and since two years ago, it has also opened several stores since it brought both chan, which shows that grocery goods sales have been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to market beauty and pharmacy products again was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's did business closely with Boots in the early 2000s, but this mixed business had to be dismantled because of the way it splits into incomes from drug stores in its supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business's 281 store to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for 125 million pounds, followed by a new strategy.
It added that Lloyds will play a key role in the plan by adding many of the best luxury skincare brands to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues who will assist us in giving advice.
We’ve built our brand’s scope to every person’s need and attractive surroundings, which means we’ve reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones Reveals ‘Resentment’ When Holly Vilubi Separates from 11 Million Pound Deal
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV when TV presenter Holly Bilubi decided to diverge from the 11 million pounds deal for Dragons Den’s Star Peter Jones’ lifestyle brand business, Peter Jones showed ‘displeasement’ on it.
Bilubi does not have the time at all for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
Both of these businesses were being compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This 37-year-old morning presenter announced separation on Instagram.
Holly Bilubi separated herself from the business of her charming lifestyle brand at the last moment with Dragons Den’s star Peter Jones – so she could focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have shown that when the TV’s Golden Girl admitted on Tuesday during a stressful meeting at Jones’ business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she was estranging from her new deal — worth 1.5 million pounds — that Jones expressed resentment on it, this means that Bilubi no longer has enough time to give their homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The turnover was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was being considered to have doubled it from an estimated 11 million pounds given by Vilubi.
The 37-year-old Wilubi announced on Instagram that she was getting separated from Truly, after that Jones left the UK to go to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: “Holly’s priorities were at the top of the day.
It was considered his long-term future, which made this brand going to move a lot over the next few decades.
His decision shocked every person associated with this business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to starting out.
The warehouse in Marlowe Headquarters is full of goods to be sold."
Experts believe that the UK’s richest star separation of this morning presenter can cause the firm to lose several million because it has invested a lot in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear and is also likely to be delayed in starting.
At the same time, it can also end a long friendship.
Bilubi’s three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close enough to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for the past ten years.
Wilubi started Truly with Cap in 2016 and was associated with it in March as the 52-year-old Jones Chairman.
Baldwin's TV production firm has a 40 percent stake in holiday couples and Jones.
Bilubi has now become the brand ambassador of M&S and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin to host them in I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
We don't want to talk about their business case," said a close source from Jones last night.
serious talks 'and then we agreed'
He mocked the criticism and said that the news media would keep commenting on him, some would consider it a “presidential work” and become very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump renounced so much?
Trump told in his showy "News Anchor" voice.
I didn’t sacrifice anyone.”
Kim’s interest is in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a big step was taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free in the first meeting, he said.
But, nuclear-free interaction was stopped.
After more than three months of the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Rei Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North North is not waiting for the U.S.’s “compatible answer” to North Korea’s early disarmament steps.
The U.S. has continued to pressurize to maintain sanctions instead, he said.
Trump’s rally speech saw a much more optimistic view of him.
We are engaged in building good relations with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people were killed.
Now our relationship has become very good.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – including completing rocket tests, helping free hostages, and bringing back survivors’ American troops to their homes, he said.
Also, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating relations with Kim.
It is very easy to stay in office but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join this area, we will have about 200 people to stop them," Trump said, pointing directly towards the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and earthquake destroys an island, hundreds of people die
After the earthquake in Lombok, the incident was told to foreign NGOs that they did not need them.
Despite over 10 per cent of Lombok’s population being devastated, no national disaster was declared, as well as a condition to provide international help.
In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they were not asking for international help, so it became a little more challenging,” said Ms. Sumbu.
Yet, Save the Children teamed up with a team to visit Palu, but it has not yet been made sure that employees from another country can come here to provide support or not.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, says Indonesian officials were taking stock of Palu’s position, they were looking at whether international agencies would allow the contribution of support effort.
Given such conditions that come to Indonesia over and over again, it looks like there is no preparation for the outbreak of nature in this country at all.
However, shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunamis in Ach, but they are not like shelters on other beaches.
Sirens warning for tsunamis in Palu has seen a decrease, no matter how harmful the warning may be, it is likely to increase the damage to life.
Whether it's the best time to hang out, it's challenging to move between several islands in Indonesia.
It is always complicated to arrange employees and goods from natural calamities.
The victims of the earthquake are being brought to a hospital in Lombok for treatment which is far from Palu and takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo created the issue of Indonesia’s very bad infrastructure for his election campaign and he spent a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
But, Mr. Joko’s administration was dispersed due to lack of funds as the next year is going to be re-election.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of Muslim democracy have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than ten thousand people became homeless, because Christians and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using staves, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
SEE: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturget conceded with Chelsea in an enigmatic manner

Eventually the ball fell out of the grip of Kepa Arizabalaga and went into the net.
It was just an attempt to get in touch with the ball and take it as far as possible from players like Shaak, so I just tried to take as much time as possible for myself,” Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that the thorns were coming and touched once and didn’t think too much about it and just hit the shot.”
Chelsea went 1-0 forward in halftime after Belgium's best player Aiden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball got closer to the midfield and reached the Liverpool Half game, the blues striker passed to Matteo Covasik in that game.
Kovasik rushed the ball into the midfield very quickly.

This afternoon the woman’s knowers arrived at the spot and asked where her body was found this morning.
Police are investigating the incident and they say that they will soon give this information to the victim’s family members.

The statue of Cromwell, built in front of Parliament, recently became the most famous monument, it was re-entered in ‘History’.
Its exile would be the ideal justice for the destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts created by their radical Purinton followers, such as its Taliban.
But, the Cromwell Society explained Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “stupid” and “try to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “The current debate on removal of idols had a strong apprehension that Oliver Cromwell’s statue would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
There was neither any order nor Cromwell made it for the emblem of the English Civil War.
It may be wrong that Cromwell must have abandoned his ancestor Thomas' works in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft the best representation of Cromwell is evidence of the idea of the 19th century and part of the history of a statue that many still consider to be admireable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is respected by many, which is probably why most people still know him as the defender of parliament standing against external pressures in the case of the monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be absolutely accurate representatives, which historically remains the subject of debate.
It is obvious that since the struggle in the middle of the 17th century, our nation has been developing, and the statue of Cromwell remains a personal identity in which a glimpse of one side of that partition appears.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and worth remembering.”
The deadly boar attacked the Chinese farmer who killed the farmer
According to local media reports, in a market in southwestern China, the pig attacked a farmer who killed the farmer.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that as a person’s identity, only his nickname “Yuan” was detected, his body was diagnosed with severe wounds, his body was found soaked with blood near the pig-bare in Lipansui’s market in Guizhou Province.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Kinhai province, China, a piggy bank farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in the piggery.
Reportedly, he came on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market with his cousins living in the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that a piggyback door was opened nearby.
He said that a large male pig was shown in a pig-barge with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to Guiyang Evening News, his cousin named “Wu” said, “My cousin’s feet were soaked with blood and completely injured.”
Security camera footage showed that Yuan came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed its pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person and killed him was not of the yuan or its cousin.
Evening News was told by a market manager that the pig was kept closed so that it could not attack a person, although the police collected evidence by taking stock of the scene.
People from the Yuan family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, rare cases have previously been registered by pigs to attack people.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband in their farm, causing a person to be seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife frightened the animal.
In 2012 a farmer from Oregon was attacked and killed by his pigs and made his own meal, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "hazardous" when they get a blood flavor.
They are just playing.
They bite with teeth and are very searchable... they are not meant to hurt you.
All you have to do is give them enough respect,” she explained.
The remainder of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rains in Southwestern America
According to the forecast, the storm is becoming weaker due to the cold water of Rosa Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will flood North Mexico and Southwestern America in the coming days.
According to Eastern Time on Sunday, at 5 a.m., the wind speed at Rosa recorded 85 miles per hour, this is a Category 1 storm, and it was located 385 miles south-west of Mexico’s Punta Eugenia.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean has begun to form a trough shape and is heading towards the west coast of America. Since Rosa is scheduled to reach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, a lot of tropical moisture will start to flow in the northern areas of Southwestern America.
On Monday, parts of Mexico will receive 10 inches of rain because of Rosa.
After that, the moisture coming from the trough in the coming days will bring heavy rainfall in the southwest consisting of tropical moisture.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will likely cause dangerous floods, debris flow, and landslides in the desert.
Too much tropical moisture will cause the rainfall rate to be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
The southwestern part, especially most parts of Arizona, is likely to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can cause a lot of flooding with poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-level desert.
Due to heavy rains, valleys can become risky rivers and there will be strong winds and dust flying in local areas along with thunderstorms.
Some parts of the Southern California coast will receive a lot of rain locally due to the approaching trough.
A total of more than half an inch of rain is likely to occur, which can lead to some extent of debris flow and create a slippage situation on the roads.
This will be the first rain of the humid weather in the region.
There will be some sporadic tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings before rains become more widespread on Mondays and Tuesdays.
There will be heavy rain in the four corners on Tuesday and it will continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures may change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October as the Arctic season cools at this time, but the tropical regions are quite hot.
Sometimes there are strange changes in temperature due to this short distance.
A good example of this is a strange change in the temperature in Central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the weather will start to warm up and the heat will increase.
Most areas in the Central and Eastern U.S. are expected to warm up from October to the weather that can range from southern plains to some areas in the northeast to the wider 80s.
New York City temperature can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting a sign that there are plenty of opportunities for Eastern U.S. to stay above the average temperature in the first six months of October.
Over 20 million people saw the hearing of Brett Cavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the trial of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman in the Supreme Court who accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual abuse, allegedly done in the 1980s, the woman’s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a hearing shown on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlocks were also observed, with broadcasters blocking Friday’s last-minute twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen’s regular program, which was filed by FBI’s Jeff Flake after investigating the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was fully sure that at a high school party, Cavanaugh fed him with drugs and tried to take off his clothes.
Cavanaugh defended himself, saying he was absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw this report by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was calculating average audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Statistics for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing this did not exist quickly.
In addition, usually Nielsen has some trouble calculating people who see in offices.
From this point of view, this is equivalent to the number of viewers of the playoff football game or the Academy Award.
Nielsen reported that the Fox News channel, which the host considering has highly supported the appointment of Cavanaugh, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers on it during the entire day’s hearing.
The viewership on ABC was 3.26 million and finished second.
3.1 million viewers were present on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC, and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
People were very interested in hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
A statement was issued after a term from the office of the liberal Republicans stating that they would sound on behalf of the Cavanaugh, they came before the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, screaming at the time to protest the hearing of the protesting Judicial Committee.
When they were being called slanderous, they were standing with their eyes bent for a few minutes at the time, it was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, “Take, I’m standing here in front of you too.”
Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
Was you brought to power because you made a lot of women powerless," he was told.
Flake pointed out that a statement was issued from his office before the elevator was closed and said that he would be able to keep his entire point at the hearing of the committee.
While Cavanaugh’s nomination for the Judiciary Committee vote was going ahead for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live several hours later.
But, Flak pointed out that he would do so with a thorough understanding that the FBI would look at allegations against nominees next week, which are being urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake interacted with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After interacting with Coons and several Senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake loved power, because it was clearly visible that by approving the cavanaugh without investigation Republicans would not be able to get votes.
President Trump has approved a FBI probe into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuse critics that they are ‘politics’ about Brexit
In the interview with the newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics to stop messing with the future of Britain by making "politics play" in the EU and put their full focus on the national interest.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa may join the Conservative Party Conference to be held in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.

Popocapetal volcanic ash has been found in the southern areas of Mexico’s capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned the citizens of Mexico that they stayed away from the volcano and told that a sequence of gas and ash has been recorded 183 times in 24 hours.

Police clashes with separatists from Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Anniversary
Six Barcelona people were detained after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the rioters police on Saturday, and thousands of rival demonstrations attended the first anniversary celebrated to vote on isolation in Catalonia.
A group of pro-masked separatists threw eggs and powdered paints on the riotous police, causing road dust to be black, which usually caused trouble to commuters.
The police used their batons to overcome the skirmish and later even scrambled.
Pro-independence groups raised the slogan "no mistake, no forgiveness" for several hours, while federal protesters raised the slogan "Spain remained immortal".
Fourteen people who were injured were treated because of the performance, according to a local press report.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum considered illegal has been increasing tension in areas with independent thought for a year, but people with separatist views of Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters chose a great way to freedom, although there were fewer people who heavily opposed voting against segregation.
The officials of Catalonia said that when the police were trying to stop people from moving forward at the polling stations in the area amid the clashes, about 1000 people were injured last year.
The groups that supported freedom stayed there overnight on Friday to assist the National Police to prevent performance.
The performance was carried forward, but he was forced to take a separate decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Terminus had arrived with his wife to participate in the separatist protest, he told that he was not seeing any possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents expressing happiness by voting, but it seems that we are stuck now,” he said.
Even when there was a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, the pro-independence parties of Catalonia struggled to keep an impact with many of their famous leaders this year, whether it was in exposing themselves or waiting for their role to block the collection of ballots organized and for the continuous declaration of freedom.
The 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded the protest on his phone to assist the police, said the conflict between politicians on both sides was stopped.
He said, “It’s become very stressful.”
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of the nine leaders of Catalonia, who has been involved in pre-trail prison since last year, announced that they would fight in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
Fighting European elections as a candidate is one of the best ways to return to democratic importance and condemn the return that we have seen in the Government of Spain.

Menga wins Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
Livingston, who is progressing quickly according to the manager of Ebrox Club, stunned the Rangers so that Steven Gerrard had to take responsibility for only his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga’s strike made the difference that Gary Holt’s side move along the Hiberan in the second half of the match equalled.
Gerrard’s side remained one step away from the victory in this season’s premiership and will face the leaders hearts next Sunday, who are behind eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, bringing head coach Holt to replace Kenny Miller last month is winning consistently in the Division of the Livingston Six Game.
Livingston missed showing the visitor his game
A long time before scoring, the Holt team should have gone ahead, as well as their fine game led to a variety of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but was left behind by an attempt to score goals, then Allen Lithgo could only be direct, doing his best after slipping so that Craig Lightett could complete the goal in the header.
Hosts got a chance to play against Rangers, they knew they could put visitors in trouble on the set piece.
And this is how he got a significant goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked to set Menga, who made a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their positions, but missed out on home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely left behind,
This pattern also continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted to be saved on Kelly.
Scott Pitman's shot was stopped by Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor with feet and Lithgo played a full-fledged capture of the game by flicking from the second Livingston.
Crosses continued to roll in the Livingston Box, while two penalty claims were made after Lightett’s challenge, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on Handball.
Analysis of Livingston's 'Extraordinary Goal'
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland inducted into Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's exceptional performance and result.
For any person, they were excellent, they have continued to increase expectations on this growing trajectory.
His game modes and personality have changed amazingly since his return from the top flight, but the highest credit goes to Holt’s way in which he has given the team a new framework since his arrival.
There were many great players in it.
Captain Lightett was the best player, he saved brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warl engaging behind him.
However, the rangers lacked learning.
The kind of great performance he has performed many times under Gerard was less than his standard.
Their final ball was lacking – they were only able to cut towards their home side open once – and it remained like some wake-up calls for rangers who retained themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan welcomed mixed in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and Germany leaders met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles spilled but got no benefit.
It is President Erdogan’s last day on a controversial visit to Germany – aiming to improve relations with NATO’s allies.
They were stuck in controversies on several issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkish exhortation in the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke on the construction of a huge new mosque in Cologne.
Outside Turkey, the city is one of the largest Turkish residents.
The police, speaking of security reasons, prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdogan – some of them even belonged to Kurd – also raised slogans, blasphemed Erdogan’s policies and Germany government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-way protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom regarded him as a German Turk hero, and others insulted him as the arbitrary ruler.

Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are prone to flooding (dry areas may benefit) due to Hurricane Rosa
The threat situation remains in tropical areas after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona, but it is already likely that it is what the remaining capacity of this hurricane in the coming week can affect the Desert Southwest, which poses a risk of causing too much flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, as well as cities in Western Arizona’s southern and eastern Nevada, south-eastern California, and Utah are likely to flood heavily.
Rain on Monday evenings is expected to flow straight through the entire Phoenix via Rosa on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service, based in Phoenix, tweeted, “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Hurricane AZ range."
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that Arizona’s Mogolon rim can rain from 2 to 4 inches, as well as is likely to be up to 6 inches.
The Central Rockies and Great Basin, as well as the Desert Southwest, are likely to have rainfall ranging from 1 to 2 inches, as well as its 4 inches.
Outside of areas at risk of severe flooding, Rosa’s rain can prove to be a boon as there is drought in this area.
However, the flood remains a very serious concern, but there is still a drought situation in the Southwest, which is likely to benefit a lot from the rain.
According to the U.S. Drout Monitor, only 40 per cent of the area in Arizona has a lot of drought, it is the second-highest-grade drought,” it reported in the weather.com report.
First, the storm will pass through the Baja California Peninsula of Rosa Mexico.
The maximum air speed of Hurricane Rosa on Sunday morning was 85 mph, at that time it was 385 mph south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and it is just moving north at a speed of 12 mph.
This storm is still in cold water in the Pacific region due to which its power is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the power of tropical storms may create landslides in Mexico on Monday at noon or evening.
Some areas in Mexico are likely to receive heavy rains that can increase the risk of flooding.
According to the “weather.com” report, “it is expected that there may be rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora from 3 to 6 inches, as well as it is also likely to be 10 inches.”
After that, Rossa will travel across Mexico on Tuesday night, before reaching the Arizona border on the north side on Tuesday morning, becoming a tropical storm, after which it will travel towards the south in Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
The biggest threat from Rosa or its leftover parts is Baja California, Northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rains are likely," the National Hurricane Center said.
It is estimated that the steep floods and debris flow in the deserts due to these rains threaten the public wealth and can lead to landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump calls Qawanaugh’s trouble annoyed by the Democratic Party
The judge is a person who is denied by the ruthless and outrageous strategy of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble that Kannaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party’s anger during his enrollment process.
On Thursday, Kwanaugh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blessy Ford alleged to him that in adolescence several decades ago, Kwanaugh had sexually assaulted Ford, during his cleaning, Kwanaugh has forcibly and emotionally refuted this.
Ford also testified about the charge during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, "The inhabitants of America saw the quality and courage of Kavanaugh being the best person that day."
From a crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, “Voting a judge Kavanaugh means voting to one who is the most accomplished legalist of our time, he can confirm the law and judge with the actual record of public service.
Speaking on the importance of Republican votes in medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kawanaugh.
Now there are only five weeks left, from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not involved, but in reality I'm involved," he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for all the candidates who really deserve.”
Trump said Democrats were on a campaign to "protest and block".
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the first counting by the Senate in Kwanaugh’s nomination was scheduled to begin on Friday.
Hundreds of people died due to tsunamis, hundreds of people died, the number of people who died is increasing.
On Saturday, officials said that when there was a huge earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, high waves started rising in the sea and at least 384 people died.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of Palu town in which hundreds of people gathered, after the evening, when a six-metre (18 feet) high wave arose, it caused havoc, due to which many people died and all the things around them were also wasted.
The tsunami came after a 7.5-intensity earthquake.
Yesterday when Tsunami was at risk, the people in the middle were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately," Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho in Briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not only lead to the deaths of people, but it also pulled cars, logs, and houses around the ground. The tsunami travelled to the open sea at a speed of 800 kmph (497 mph) before attacking the beach.
He told that to avoid tsunamis, some people climbed trees and defended themselves.
16,700 people were evacuated from the 24 centers of the Palu.
Photos posted by the Disaster Agency from the airplane saw that many buildings and shops have been ruined, bridges have turned and collapsed and a mosque is also surrounded by water.
Postoperative trauma in the onshore city continued on the rocks on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced frequent earthquakes.
Indonesia’s agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the capacity of energy emitted by a huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the capacity of a nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said that the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay can increase the size of tsunamis.
Nugroho explained the damage in detail, saying that it is "very terrible" and that led to thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
He told that the bodies of some people were trapped in the debris of collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people have not been detected.
Nugroho reported that the area located along 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu close to the center of the earthquake is likely to be very high in the area called Dongla.
Nugroho reported that the communication system in Dongala was "completely damaged".
In a statement, Red Cross reported that more than 300,000 people were living here and its employees and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It is already a sad event, but it can be even more terrible,” it said.
On Saturday, the agency criticized why, if the tsunami was about to come to Palu, not previously, though officials said the warning was about to be issued, but the waves had already gone.
A person created some videos amateurized and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the situation on the upper floor of the building was giving a person a voice present on the road below and a frightening warning can be heard in it.
Within a few minutes, too much water started coming out of the middle and the buildings and cars also went on pulling with them.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a lightning problem in Palu and the lines of communication were cut off making rescue efforts difficult for the authorities to combine together.
By taking the assistance of Jakarta and other cities, authorities have started sending cargo aircraft, officials pointed out that people still need to be evacuated and food as well as meet other requirements.
The city airport has just been reopened for relief efforts and will close in October.
The withdrawal centers in Palu were to be visited by President Joko Widodo on Sunday.
The number of people who died due to tsunamis in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It is very terrible.
Mr Doseba informed that the World Vision employees based in Donggala tried their best to make the city of Palu safe, employees have lived in it by making tarpaulin shelters in their office premises, they have seen this catastrophe with their own eyes.
Talking to them, it turned out that they saw many houses ruining,” he said.
It is very terrible.
Help groups began bringing goods to disaster relief seriously, some people filed a complaint that external aid personnel seeking special expertise are being refused to get into the palat.
According to Indonesia regulations, funding from abroad, any goods, and help from the employee can be taken only if the disaster zone is declared as the national disaster zone.
But, this has not been done yet.
This disaster is still at the province level,” said Auliya Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross, based in Indonesia.
After the government has said that it is a national disaster, only then we can involve international support personnel in rescue work but it has not yet happened."
Even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, people whose friends and family members in Palu had not been detected were expected to find their loved ones somewhere miraculously as natural calamities came after.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in a sewer.
The rescue team on Sunday evacuated a woman from the rubble. Next to her, her child was trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian national paragliding team coach Gandon Subando trained two paragliders of Asian games to find out the lost people who were dedicated to it in Indonesia from the beginning of this month.
Mr. Mandagi was also among the people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
I am also emotionally suppressed as a senior in the paragliding field,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that it was only after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel that the paragliding community started its work, they had sent messages through WhatsApp to the Palu contestants participating in the Beach Festival.
However, they don't only see the gray mark on their message, but the blue mark is not visible on it.
I think it means that the messages could not reach the people,” he said.

Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to keep it.
About the change, he tweeted on Saturday on Twitter and said: "Formally his name will remain Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has for some time taken his name and will use the name for his eighth album title Moneykar, released in June.
This change is being made in his presence in Saturday night live, where he is expected to start his new album, Jandi.
The producer of the show told that he removed Singer Ariana Grande from the show who refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
Along with shortening his current professional name, West had already pointed out that this term has religious significance for him.
Speaking on the title of his album with Radio Host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, “I believe that the word ‘these’ has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means ‘you’.”
So I’m you, I’m we, that’s us.
This word is derived from Kanye, which means just one, which is just this - it shows our goodness, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album depicts who we are.
They are one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.

An old friend from West, Jay-Z has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to use army against civilian civilians
The Mexican president-candidate Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador on completing 50 years of country for deadly retaliation against students vowed that the military force will never be used for civilian civilians anymore.
López Obrador on Saturday at Telco Plaza promised that "the military force will never be used to put pressure on Mexicans."
On October 2, 1968, the peaceful movement in the plaza was fired by soldiers, in which more than 300 people died, it happened at the time when leftist students’ movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised assistance to the youth of Mexico, they will grant every month to the students studying and open as many free government universities as possible.
He said that due to less opportunities to get unemployment and education, the youths join the people committing crime.
U.S. should double the fund offered for AI
Since China is becoming more active in Artificial Intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of spending it takes to research this area, said Kai-Fu Li, a low-paid investor and AI businessman for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Following several U.S. government actions, AI has made this comment, adding that the U.S. lacks overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China launched a plan: it aims to reach No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
doubling the AI research budget will give a great start, taking a look at all other countries, so the U.S. is far behind the matter, and we are making efforts for the next success of AI," Li said.
Doubling the fund can double the likelihood that the next major achievement of AI will be in the U.S.,” Li told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, an investor of Face++, one of the best AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he had worked on an AI system that surpassed the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was appointed executive at Microsoft Research and president at Google’s China branch.
Lee described the technical qualifications of the previous U.S. government, including the robot-related challenges of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and said who would be the next government to recognize the next visionary.
Lee pointed out that U.S. researchers often face a lot of difficulties to get government help.
It's not a China removing academic leaders, it's a corporate," Lee said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other tech companies have appointed veterans from the university to work on AI.
Li pointed out that the U.S. can aid its AI efforts by changing the immigration policy.
According to me, permission to do a PhD in AI should be automatically obtained through a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China gives economic grants to researchers from the National Science Foundation and other government organizations U.S. in the same way that funds are funded to the people of the Academic Institute, but the quality of education in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Department opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, aiming to engage partners from industry and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, the same month, DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next in which it talked about an investment of $2 billion.
For NSF, this investment is now over $100 million every year in AI research.
Meanwhile, legislation was enacted in the U.S. that the demand for creating the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence will be ignored for months.
People of Macedonia voted for whether the country’s name would be changed or not
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted for whether the country's name would be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a work that would solve decades-old dispute with Greece, which led Greece to the banning of its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
There is also a province in Greece named Macedonia, saying that its northern neighbor has its name on its territory which has led to two names for the same claimantry and is already included in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments made a deal in June based on the new name suggested, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that the renaming of Macedonia would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in the Slavic.
President George Ivanov said that he would not go to vote in the referendum and boycott the campaign, he expressed doubt that the minimum 50% vote required for this voting will be valid.
On the voting ballot, the question would be written: “Do you give your approval for the agreement with Greece to subscribe to NATO and the EU?”
Proponents associated with the change of name along with Prime Minister Zoran Zeve say that it is important for Macedonia to make a member in bodies such as the EU and NATO, it is one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this future is for the young people in Macedonia, from which they will be able to live freely in the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje.
However, not legally emphasizing for this, most members of Parliament say they will act according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required for name change in Parliament.
The State Election Commission says that there was no notification of irregularities till 1 pm.
However, when the last parliamentary election took place in 2016, voting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, in which 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gojo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zev along with his wife Zorika and his son Dushko went to vote in Macedonia for a change in the country’s name, so that on September 30, 2018, Stromica, the country’s name in Macedonia joined NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov, a resident of Skopje, was preparing a small stage and was placing chairs in front of those who are going to oppose this voting.
We must subscribe to NATO and EU, but we want to join it by raising our head, not through an agreement,” Kavardkov said.
Our country is poor, but we also have our own self-respect.
If they don’t want to subscribe to us in the name of Macedonia, no matter what, we can become part of the Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia.”
Prime Minister Zeve has said that membership in NATO will give much-needed investment to Macedonia, the unemployment rate here is more than 20 percent.
I think too much of the vote will go to positivity because more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO,” Zeve said after voting.
He pointed out that the "yes" result would result in "confirmation of our future".
The survey published by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in this voting in the required voting.
The second survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Among them, 70 percent of people agree to vote in Yes.
Over 50 percent voting is necessary for voting to be successful.
If the voting fails, the Western Government’s policy to be formed in May last year will take the first serious setback.

ridiculously Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
Argentina’s striker was passed into the midfield early.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he got three Brighton players protected.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a player who defended before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball back to Aguero, using his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out of his right to the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporter, “Aguero’s legs have had some problems that he is troubled by.”
We spoke on their games 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at the same time.”
But, it was because of the sterling that made the sky blues an early advantage in the encounter of the Premier League.

Shazer wants to beat him by playing against rockies
After the playoffs dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no major reason for someone else to insist on the start.
But, the Scaer who has always competed expects that on Sunday he will score big against Colorado Rockies, but the playoffs for Rockies still remain the only possibility, winning the game played with Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies received a wild-card spot by registering a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to get the first division title.
Even though we are not able to play great, at least we can play to know that the crowd and the second-team Denver environment will probably be for the highest level of sport I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in that game?”
The Nationals are still yet to tell about the starter for Sunday, but it is heard that such a situation could involve the shezer.
Shazer, who played for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullen session on Thursday and will pitch to his normal on Sunday.
Washington’s right hander finished at 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes this season’s 220 2/3 inning.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
Talking about the importance of Republican opinion in midterm elections, the president referred to Brett Kawanough as the position around Lec Supreme Court.
All the work we do will be at stake in November.
It is now just five weeks for the most important choice of our lives.
It’s a huge choice – I’m not involved, but I’m really involved, because I’m fighting for all the great candidates,” he said.
You can take a look at this very terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see all the things happening right now.
In addition, they are trying to grab power using other important tools, which you know is meaningless and useless.
To get power and control, they don’t care who is sad, who is capable of it, they just want power and control to be found by them, but we won’t let that happen.”
The Democrat’s campaign is “protesting and obstructing”.
Moreover, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you saw the anger of the Democrats and also how mean and evil they are,” he said.
He referred to the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein by referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was strongly appreciated by the audience.
Remember the answer.
Did you leak the document?
What.
No, no, I’m waiting for that – whose body language was really bad – I saw such a bad body language for the first time.”
Working is no longer the Broad Church.
For those who speak of their own mind, it is not worth to tolerate.
When the activists who pushed my local party up voted to choose me, it was a huge surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest among the labor MPs whose importance is very low – we cannot say everything in our mind.
My MP colleague Joan Ryan was here as well because she too voiced for antisocialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me on disagreements with Jeremy Corbin.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, Europe had similar problems in a way that Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
It was said on Friday for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting that "our wish is to include all things in the meeting and to be beneficial."
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I mostly saw that Friday Night GC meetings were exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or are promised that the politics of “kind and benevolent people” is actually forgotten, here too.
It is obvious that in the Labour Party, if the viewpoints are different, they are not tolerated and for every consideration, it is decided whether this party is admissible for leadership.
It started right after Jeremy became the leader, for colleagues I’d already thought about have a political opinion like me, hoping that I’d be overturned by what I said and work on positions I could never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I raise a voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, sharp comments are made on it, the politics of the centre is condemned and I am told that I am not eligible to the Labour Party.
Moreover, he is not just my experience.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way businesses work and are dedicated to colleagues who always face sex related or racial abuse, but don’t lag behind raising a voice.
There are many disappointing aspects in today’s political era, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin claimed that it was necessary for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the Broad Church and the changes in every "unbelief" proposal or the party's selection rule have been greatly reduced.
In the last two years, many people advised me and urged me to be silent, not over-speaked, and after that I would be considered "right."
But, I did not come to politics for this.
32 years ago when I was associated with labor as a school student, I was encouraged to oppose Thatcher’s government, I was told to completely abandon my school’s broader classroom, I sought to provide better public services to those who need them the most – whether as local councillors or as government ministers.
I never hid any of my politics, including politics made in the previous elections.
In Nottingham East, there is no person who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement regarding my current leadership.
To all those who promoted the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is moving towards Brexit damaging homes, businesses, and our public services, I do not think it is necessary for the Labour Party to waste its time and its energy in showing its honesty.
But, in reality I have a message that is not meant for Nottingham Momentum, it is meant for my supporters, whether they are labor members or not: I am proud of whether I am serving you and I promise that no deselection risk or political campaign barriers can arise in my work, I am only interested in things that interest you all.

Eye 38 - 17 Melrose: Unceremonious Eye Reach the Top
The two late attempts may affect the final outcome to some extent, but there is no doubt that Air Tenant deserved victory in this finest recreational match of the premiership.
Now they are just at the top of the table of ten undefeated sides.
In the end, his defense was excellent, he found the best opportunities he could find, which led the domestic team to move forward and gave coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
We thoroughly checked our games and we are still undefeated, so I become happy," he said.
Melrose's Robin Christie explained: "The credit goes to Ay, who cashed out his opportunity as much as possible."
Frezier Climón had to come to the front of Eyre with Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, but Skotton's player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card for the game by Warriors, which Melrose got a chance to score and Jason Bagen cashed out a very difficult attempt.
Just before half-time with the help of a penalty, Clemo increased the air, he scored the goal and then tried to unilaterally match 17-5 for the iron at the time of break.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s attempt was rounded up by Baggot, reducing Lewe’s five points.
After that, Ruidih Knott suffered a serious injury that caused the game to stop for a long time, was strained, then after the start of the game, Ay went ahead and attempted through Stafford McDoval which Climo turned into a goal.
At that time, Ay's team captain Blair McPherson got a yellow card, and then Melrose gave an effort to Extra Man Bruce Colvin because of a lot of pressure at the end of the game that failed to cash him out.
However, the host team left behind and when Struán Hutchinson got a yellow card from the penalty line-out to face the ball's climo, McPherson touch down while pushing the air from the back.
Climo turned it into a goal after Kelly Rowe sent David Armstrong's box kicks to collect and Flanker Greger Henry away for the fifth attempt of the home side, as they could when the game resumes.
Game Stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kieran is still looking for ways to go to the hospitality industry, some time ago it was revealed that he was selected for the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with the Jarvis famous BBC show, in which he works writing and accompanies comedy partner Greg Hemfil in acting long ago.
Both have reported that they will have their last series in the world of the upcoming ninth series show, and it seems to be what Kiernan has to do after Craig Lange is planning it.
Based on the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, yet the source of a Scottish sun hinted that Kearnan wanted to join a "great restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
Our right to the sea’: Land-restricted Bolivia expects Court to reopen the path to the Pacific
Military sailors are patrolling extensively at the Naval Headquarters of La Paz.
Ocean-blue flag is being hoisted on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, there is a slogan of the naval base: “We have a right over the sea.
It’s our duty to get it again.”
The coastal area Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible struggle for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land – they once again want to hoist their pennant in the Pacific Ocean.
Now he expects to regain his Bolivian land decades ago, as it waits for the International Court judge to come to judgment on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia’s diplomat Roberto Calazilla reported, “Bolivia now has a lot of enthusiasm, a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is going to give a positive result.”
Many of Bolivia’s people will look at the ICJ’s big decisions on a large screen across the country, hoping that the decision that will come from the Hague’s court will be in Bolivia’s favor — which has been negotiated for decades — is forced to return the land of Bolivia to the sea through negotiations.
Bolivia’s best president Evo Morales – who is going to face a contentious contest in the re-election next year – has also expressed positives in Monday’s ruling.
Last August, he said, “We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean.”
But, some analysts are assuming that the court’s decision will not be in Bolivia’s interest – and even if the decision comes in its interest, there will be a lot of conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to reward the province of Chile, and it has decided that possible outcomes of negotiations will not be determined.
The decision of the ICJ comes six months after the final talks took place in the International Court, which indicated that the case was "not complicated".
In addition, apart from Bolivia’s terms, it looks like it might come into the old state again for the past four years.
The issue of sea access has been prevented by the current government of Bolivia,” Jarrett said.
He suggested that Morales’ controversial statement put an end to Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate certain conditions, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision comes.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other’s country.
Bolivia’s representative in the Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Weltze, has denied that the court’s decision was unusually much faster.
He pointed out that Monday would be a “best opportunity for Bolivia to open new avenues of relations with Chile” and this would be a chance to “eliminate 139-year disagreements on mutual benefits”.
Calazila has rejected that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most famous president – was politicizing the maritime problem.
Bolivia will never retreat for its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
The decision is a chance to know what we needed to do in the past.”
North Korea has said nuclear inspection will not be stopped until it trusts the US
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
On Saturday, Rei delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He told the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit between leaders of another country in Singapore.
He remarked that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo felt like he was about to resume nuclear diplomacy after more than three months of promises made in North Korea’s Kim Jong’s Singapore.
Rei said it was a "pipe dream" that would give North defeat to sanctions and U.S. objections to the announcement of the end of the Korean war.
Washington is wary of the consent of the previously ongoing critical disarmament campaign without the announcement of Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both wish to be another summit.
But, it is totally doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about eliminating the oversight of the atomic bomb as they do not want to risk the security of the country.
Kim-Trump plans to visit Pompeo Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit that will take place both.
Paris Fashion Show shows a variety of new design headwears for your nearest high street
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from sunlight, there is no longer a need to wait.
Both Valentino and Thom Brown have created a series of great headwears for their SS19 collection on the runway that featured in the special styled famous Paris Fashion Week.
The best beneficial hats are made to avoid the heat of this year and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to show in the show.
The finest hats made by Valentino were quite large, decorated with a wide brim like wings that hanged around the head of the model.
The second accessory with a much larger side included a waterlemon hat, wizard hat, and a hat with a pineapple design – but they are not built to protect your head from frost.
Thom Brown also showed masks with special designs - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colorful masks and things like hannibal collectors were seen more than haute couture.
One creation saw all sorts of items for scuba diving, including snowbells and glasses, while the second creation saw a melt-up ice cream cone design.
Also, if you have seen more big fashion - you are blessed.
Amateurs looking for style predict that this great collection can reach great shops around you soon.
The very large-sized hat will come with a ‘La Bomba’ design heel, from a two-foot wide brim straw hat Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski everyone will be able to buy.
There was a cult label behind the best effective hat that looked quite beautiful, with the second creation catwalk posted on social media — featuring a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafa fring and had a white leather handle attached to it, it was the finest attraction of the La Riviera SS19 collection of jacquimus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I hope that big hats and bags will come in stores for the coming summer season soon – since designers have impressed so much that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories’.
John Edward: Language skills required for citizens of countries outside
Scotland’s private schools keep track of track records of the finest education, and since 2018, it has continued to deliver great test results, strengthening personal and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are associated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), led by these schools trying to serve the best of their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting the citizens of outside countries.
As an education sector that can build a school curriculum and implement it, we are seeing that modern languages continue to choose as a choice of a subject known and intended in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in the language that he understands, you become great for him.
If you talk to him in his own language, he loves his heart.”
When we want to build a relationship and trust people from other countries, we think we can trust English more.
In this recent year’s test results we can see that languages with the highest passed rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68 percent of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data gathered by 74 member schools of SCI can be seen in 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in Mandarin language, while 72 percent of students received the highest grade A in German language, 69 percent of students in French language and 63 percent of students received Spanish language Grade A.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages giving essential skills to children and young people who will be needed in the future.
Languages are now being included in private schools courses as an optional subject and in other things in the same way as STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
Surveys conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed employers struggled to hire employees in vacant positions, with 17 per cent of the candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative to have maximum language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world because of the high potential employment opportunities that language needs.
No matter what option to choose for a career, if people have learned a different language, then such skills will benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, being a multilingual person will automatically lead you to the competition.
More than 4,000 adults from Britain participated in the YouGov survey in 2013, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak enough in a foreign language and only French was the subject that 15 percent of people could speak and it was the only language to reach double-digit percentage.
For this reason, it has become necessary to invest in teaching language to children today.
Having knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, children will be able to get better opportunities to find the right employment.
Languages teaching in every school in Scotland will vary.
There are also a lot of schools that will focus on more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are in 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of whether your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose the language in private schools and will also find staff who are experts in this field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to giving children a learning environment that will prepare them for the future and give them the necessary skills to succeed, allowing them to advance in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be rejected yet that it is very important to learn languages in the country for the future, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages must be truly acknowledged as “international communication skills.”
The choice of choosing this option, diversity and excellence will continue to be given by private schools to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

Trump's Rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
Tonight, President Donald Trump held a lot of rally for the campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Next week Trump has decided five more rallies that include Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favourable places.
With the Supreme Court banning the vote set in its election for an empty post, Trump aims to seek assistance for the upcoming mid-term election as there is a risk of Congress being out of control over Republicans at the time of vote count in November.
When will Trump’s rally tonight take place in West Virginia and how will you see it online?
The Trump rally time in Wheeling, West Virginia has been fixed tonight at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally online in West Virginia via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidates can give Trump speech on this week’s hearing for Brett Kawanough, the allegations against Kawanaugh for sexual crimes have prevented confirmation of the expected Senate vote for a week during the FIT probe.
But, the main goal of this tense rallies month is to assist Republicans facing elections in November.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, “The aim of these five rallies next week is to energise volunteers and supporters as a Republican effort to protect and increase the majority they have held in the House of the Senate and delegates.”
According to Reuters, the spokesperson who has been removed from Trump’s campaign said, “Congress’s control has become so important for his agenda that the president will visit only those states, where the season of our campaign will be very busy.
According to West Virginia Metro News, “the supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania can be brought to the Pittsburgh media from the tonight rally, determined in Vesbanco Arena, wheeling.”
Saturday will be the second time of the previous month Trump has visited West Virginia, with more than 40 percent of his votes being received in 2016 from this locality.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, a candidate who is behind the West Virginia Republican Senate survey.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University’s political scientist Simon Haider said, “If the president is trying to give Morris an edge in the election, this is not a good sign for him.”
Ryder Cup 2018: The team USA showed a desire to compete so as to keep the Sunday Singles top-ranked expectations
After three unilateral sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will get the result of what is going to happen in this rider cup.
The passing cycle of time is a completely new concept for players, but when the player goes ahead and in competitions like which player to trust, it cannot be guessed.
So, what do they say about this momentum now?
They had a six-point lead that is now four, so I think we have to increase our speed a little,” Jordan Spieth said while moving the day.
Of course, Europe benefited and went beyond four points by taking 12 points in the game.
According to Spieth, American think they have a few chances left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both gained three points out of four from their game.
From Spieth Tea to Green is fatal for everyone and is also the best in the game.
As people progressed ahead of his game, they gladly clung loudly showing excitement, when they and Thomas moved two more points down after two, performing important puts to complete four all-squares.
It was because of his putt that his team came in the 15th position with the same screen, sort that tells you that you don’t consider the American team out of it.
All you really have to do is play great and keep in mind that the victory is yours,” Spieth said.
This is what all players say who have gone out of the game.
18 holes to create a mark.
Over the past two days, only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas are named Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, making a new history in the Ryder Cup.
Having different styles of Europe but a better couple gained four points in four and are at the forefront.
On Saturday afternoon there is "Molywood". The only couple who did not shoot a bogie, but they stayed away from Bogie until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and before 9 a.m. Friday morning.
On Sunday, he got the run and the way to get that run in this strong crowd and from this strong crowd as if he was a beat-r, and there was no player who could turn the potential win of the European team into a defeat. It seemed like Le Golf National’s sunset would be earlier than Fleetwood or Molinary.
It is good that both are at different holes in different ways.
However, European dignity has been well talked about.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at that time their pair was made with Alex Noren.
A bogie in front of the nine dug and the spaniard and swede in the two doubles, before they were never able to reach here.
However, on Sunday there was no one to help you get to your hole.
Foreball and Foursome were great when viewed because the interaction between pairing was quite great, he advised that they don’t have to take advice and they are well-versed in the way of changing the strategy.
As a team, Europe played great and took a significant lead on the last day, but this Foursome session also showed that the team USA has the ability to combat what, especially in Stateside, is doubtful.
Europe takes 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage of it well on the last day of the Ryder Cup after the 10-6 lead foreball and Foursome match on Saturday on the United States.
The finest pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead on Tiger Woods struggling with two wins to make their Milan far ahead of the four points of Le Golf National.
Two years ago in Hazeltine, Thomas dominated Bejorn's European side Morning Fourball by American side misfires to avenge his defeat of the trophy, giving him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the Foursome, registering a win in two matches, but they could not avoid losing.
Jim Furyk’s side needs eight points in a Sunday 12 single match to keep the trophy win.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while Molinery and Molinery started with "Molywood" after the Sensational Weekend, a second pair that has won four points in their opening four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After losing Woods and Patrick Reed in Foreball, he again defeated the best player Woods and American Rookie Bryson DeShammbu by 5 and 4 points, performing even better than before to lose.
Woods, who held himself ahead through two matches on Saturday, showed his best performance, but now he has lost 29 matches of Foreball and Foursome and 19 times in his seven matches of Roe.
Justin Rose returns to Foursome again with his parter Henrik Stanson at the remaining Morning Fourball and beat another three of the world’s ranks Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copecka 2-1.
However, in the South West of Paris, the Pleasant, Breeze Day had no break of it near Europe.
Leading players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set a benchmark for the American by getting two points.
He managed a 2-1 win over Spain’s John Raham and Ian Paulter in Foreball and sent back Pauls and Rory McLaroy by defeating him 4-3 in the opening two holes.
This has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup when a team came back from a single-reach match with four points, although the kind of feroric side it was needed attracted to everyone in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to be as different from their old game.
Saying ‘there is no way’, North Korea said disarmament would only be one party that cannot be trusted
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said that on Saturday the United Nations has continued sanctions that relied on its disbelief in the United States and showed no way the country could stop inspecting the atomic bomb only on its part under such circumstances.
Last year North Korea had tried a number of ways that were associated with “critical goodwill ways”, such as, preventing the trial of the atomic bomb and the missile, demolishing the test site of the atomic bomb, and promising not to pursue the work of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology, Re Yong Ho said in the Annual General Assembly of the World Body.
However, we have not been able to find any answers for this from the US,” he said.
There will be no confidence for our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way and there is no way in such situations that we start unilateral disarmament.”
While Rei reiterated that complaints made by North Korea are about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach in view of disarmament, under which North Korea will gradually begin to benefit North Korea sequentially, his statement makes it entirely clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be left by only one party since Pyongyang has already done so.
For the first time, at the summit between the US President and North Korea leader serving in Singapore on June 12, Rei referred to the statement jointly stated by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, at that time Kim had pledged to work towards the "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea war, but the United States says Pyongyang must first stop building its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to eliminate strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The U.S. has first insisted on disarmament and has raised the pressure level of sanctions so that it can forcefully achieve its purpose, and at the same time, it also objected to the "declaration of war to end", Rei said.
The ban may tilt us, such a notion is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that our trust is becoming even less with constant restrictions.”
Rei did not discuss the plan of the second summit between Kim and Trump, he said that the U.S. leader had explained the merits of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed three meetings between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, further stating: “If the party is South Korea for this problem of disarmament and the U.S. is not, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula will not be involved in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, Rei’s speech was very different from last year’s speech when he said about the UN National Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. Mainland with North Korea’s rocket after Trump, who was called “Racket Man” on the suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to be raised for disarmament but said that there is still a lot of work to do and restrictions will remain in force until North Korea disarmament does not.
On Wednesday, Trump pointed out that he has no deadline set for this, “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or even five years.”
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps to be taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, state U.S. Secretary Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council that: “The sanctions of the Security Council must remain in force until without fail we realize that we are completely, last and verified disarmament.”
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea with full consent in 2006 for depositing funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Rei at the UN General Assembly and then told that he would go to Pyongyang again for the second summit next month.
This year Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his previous tour was not good.
They went back to Pyongyang in July and said that within just a few hours, North Korea condemned them for "gangster-like demands".
In the Moon meeting this month, North Korea resolved to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts a “compatible measure”, it will also destroy the nuclear complex.
He pointed out that Kim had promised him "compatible measures", asking for a guarantee of security that Trump in Singapore would make a resolution and move on to forming a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are doing a course for a job with adequate comfort
Harvard University has introduced a new course this year for all undergraduates who want to gain maximum comfort when coping with growing macho culture to study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nighters'.
The teacher teaching the world’s number one university students often has no choice when there are absolutely common things to do to comfort yourself.
A professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Charles Kazeasler has created a course for which he believes it is the first course of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the effect of less sleep at the time of teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
I came to a girl at the end of the year and she said: ‘Why do I say this every time that I have to go to the next class next year?’
She told me that no one told her about the importance of sleep – which shocked me.”
For the first time this year, students will know how good habit of sleeping is important in studies and athletic performance, besides this, their general health will also be improved.
Paul Barrera, a psychiatric professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director at the University’s Health Services, said that students do not sleep enough every week for which the university decided to start this course.
A series of interactive tasks have been included in the hours-long course.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to explain what will affect caffeine and light and what a lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep time in the routine.
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campuses with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
Professor Zesler said, “We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But, we believe they need to have the information – just as cigarette drinking has information about the effects on health.”
He said that the culture of experiencing pride over ‘awake and read all night’ still exists, increasing pressure on modern technology and pupils means they have less gold that has become a growing problem.
Whether you sleep enough and well or not is like the ‘secret weapon’ of the pupils, this can combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - it also protects their brain from weight loss as they are always thinking about hunger that makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler to build the course, completing his last year class in Harvard during the past year.
He said that due to the course, he became aware and motivated for the campus-wide course.
In the future, they hope that all the postgraduate students will be considered essential to complete this course before joining the competitive institute.
Prof. Gesler suggested that students should consider setting alarms before bedtime, as well as deciding when to wake them up, and that they should be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too many circadians on them that cause sleep problems.
Livingston's Against Rangers 1 - 0: Menga Scores Goal Against Gerard
Rangers faced trouble in another match due to Dolly Menga’s strike, Livingston’s 1-0 win was put on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
After a 4-1 win in the match played at St. Johnstone in February, Ibrows were looking for their first win, but Gary Holt’s team instigated Gerrard as the manager for the second defeat in the 18 game, so that the lead hearts of the Landbrokes Premiership could be kicked out with the help of eight points.
Menga striked seven minutes before half-time and after that Rangers’ line-up short didn’t even get a chance to equal the game once.
However, the Rangers have now fallen to the sixth position in the ranking, with Livingston reaching third and trailing only behind the Hiberan due to the round difference.
In addition, games for rangers can be even more trouble since the linesman calum spence's head wound has been treated after the object is clearly thrown at the other end.
Eight changes made to Gerrard’s side led to a chance for the previous iron to go to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was included in the same Livy 11 that took a point of Herts last week and the way he drilled well caused trouble to the opposition team at every turn.
Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than them.
When Menga sent Scott Peteman to Alan McGregor's goal for the first time by a lay-off, he should have only given two minutes, but the midfielder cashed out this big chance he found.
Keegan Jacobs, who was present in the deep, went to Captain Craig Hulket for a free-kick, but his defensive partner on the back post, Alan Lithgo, could only stab wide.
Rangers gained control, but in the final third, they relied more on hope than on their confidence in the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly experienced that he should have imposed penalties on the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless collided with each other, but Ref. Steven Thomson denied Columbian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first-half, but Liam Kelly, the former goalkeeper of eyebrows, faced difficulties with Lasana Colably’s header and Twi Ov Azaria’s strike.
However, in the 34th minute, Liv’s openers could go against the run of the game, but no one can deny that they alone deserve this graft.
Even after this, the best player in Rangers Deep could not chase Jacob.
When Deccan Galgher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not show any interest in him, Scott Robinson kept Menga cool to pick up for the simple finish.
When Gerard swapped the Colybelle for Ryan Kent and switched to show the effect immediately as he slotd by Winger in Morelos, he took a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line while racing well.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the same game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgo and Lightett after the long ball.
Holt’s side in the final stage could have increased his lead, but McGregor well stopped Jacobs from stud up before Lithgov widened him from the corner.
Rangers called Glenn Middleton, an alternative, who claimed another late for penalties because they were entangled with Jacobs, but Thomson did not allow him to succeed again.
Elmnack: Inventor of Geiger Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" Panchang: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and the time after... the day when Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, a future physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a device to detect and measure radioactivity, later known as Geiger Counter.
Geysers are a mainstay of counter science, it has become the mainstay of pop culture, as well as, a film "Bells of Coronado" on it in 1950, with the first time scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acting on:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After turning on these earphones you can certainly hear the effect of hidden atoms caused by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell us, right now it's definitely popping up!"
Hans Geiger passed away in 1945, when he was 63 years old.
But, his name is still alive because of his invention.
Poor cells of the immune system can be seen by new vaccines of cancer
Cancer’s new vaccine can ‘see’ poor cells of the immune system and eliminate them
The vaccine directs the immune system to identify poor cells during treatment
Through this method, the immune cells of a patient can be removed and replaced in the laboratory.
After that, they can ‘seen’ the common protein for many cancers and then replant it.
A trial for the vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was vaccinated, which saw her poor cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months has ended.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient can be extracted and replaced in the laboratory, so that they "see" the common proteins found in many cancers called HER2, and then replant cells.
Our results show that this vaccine is very promising," said J. Berzofsky, professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Pro Berzofsky said that HER2 “develops many types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer.
Directing patients’ immune cells to remove and locate cancer cells is beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West denounced Trump’s old disputed speech on the MAGA hat.
It didn't recover
After Kanye West's excellent performance, in which she praised US President Donald Trump and said that his government will be formed in 2020, too, during Saturday's Night Live he condemned him in the studio.
After the performance of his third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trump.
So, I talk to gore people many times and they say: “What’s the reason for you to like Trump, are they racist?” he said.
Still, if I was worried about racism, I would leave the US long ago.”
SNL kicked off the show with Matt Damon’s skit, in which Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kawanough’s case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made on them by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, the footage of West’s condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the posting to the West because of the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that he was threatened by going to the backstage with his headwear.
They bullied me backstage.
Don't go there wearing that hat," he said.
They bullied me!
Apart from this, he also said that I am stuck in the wrong place,” he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West said: “You want to see that wrong place?” as well, he said, “Will they make drama for my Superman Cape, because it means that you cannot tell what to do to me.
Love.”
In his comments, he referred to the audience at least twice and SNL's artists felt embarrassing, in a separate report, a person told the publication: "The entire studio was completely silent."
The West was called a few days back due to the delay in the arrival of the singer Ariana Grande, Ariana Grande’s old boyfriend rapper, Mac Miller, died.
The West surprised many viewers by giving performance on the song I Love it, he was clothed like a periyar bottle.
The West again met the Conservative Group TPUSA chief Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the most courageous people: thank you for raising the voice for the public."
But, host Karen Hunter of the talk show tweeted and said that the West is just there "which she told and which is absolutely amazing."
But, I didn’t choose someone who took advantage (by buying your music or clothes or supporting my “art”) who is promoting the wrong idea for my community or telling my community wrongly.
He is free.
That’s why we exist,” he said.
Before the show, rapper tweeted on Twitter that he had changed his name, as well as that he was just "formally known as Kanye West."
They are not the first artists to change their names, but before that Diddy and Puffy did that too whose old name was Puff Diddy and P Diddy, respectively.
He was accompanied by rapper, Snoop Dogg’s old name Snoop Lion and the late famous Prince of Music also changed his name into a symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington questioned Toxic Masculinity
Kit Hurington is known for his sworded role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Middle Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
But, 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of a macho hero, saying that seeing such rolls on the screen often motivates many young boys and they feel that this kind of difficult work is necessary to get respect.
Talking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that she is feeling ‘something going wrong’ and asked how to eliminate the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married her co-star Game of Thrones 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who believes she feels 'very firm' in talking about this problem.
Personally, I feel very strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong about masculinity," he said.
Are we teaching men that when they are growing up, they will have to deal with the problems shown on the screen?’
Kit feels that television could be partially responsible for toxic masculinity, thanks to its much more male-dominated character.
He added: 'What happens and what is taught?
From what is taught on TV and in street, young boys begin to believe that they should do certain things to be a male?
I think it has really become a question of one of the big questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the thoughts of young men," he said.
In an interview, he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series comes again at the end of the next summer, they will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well as that, he also said that he has done many programs with 'riding the battlefields and horses'.
From November, Kit will be working on Sam Shepard’s new series of True West, a film producer whose brotherhood is.
Recently, the actor told that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is his meeting with his wife Rose.
I got my life partner through this show, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved from here,” he said.
Rose has played the role of Yigret, who is the girlfriend of Kit’s character John Snow in the Emmy Award Winning Fantasy Series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, new cases in China have increased by 14%
China has announced that there has been an increase of 14% among people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from this disease.
Only about 40,000 new cases reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Given the changes that have taken place in the past few times, sex is being said to be the reason for most new cases.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
China’s health officials at a conference in Yunnan province reported that the number of people suffering from HIV through this medium had nearly zero.
However, there has been an increase of 100,000 people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China every year.
HIV infection is a serious problem with sex performed by China’s LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but the LGBT community is reported to be quite discriminatory against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ultimately marry women because of the country’s conservative importance.
Because of many infection of the disease, there is insufficient protection regarding sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which it has been promised to every person that they will be given access to HIV medication.
Maxine Waters rejects that their employees have leaked the data of the GOP senator, they described it as ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘how to plot’.
U.S. representative Maxine Waters said that one of his employees had posted three Republican U.S. Senators’ personal information on the Lomakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that claims were being investigated by Pandits and website of the "Ultra-Right Wing".
Waters tweeted on Twitter and said, "Lie, lie, and very disgusting."
Reportedly, the information provided included South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah’s two Senator Mike Lee and Orin Hatch’s home addresses and phone numbers.
This information was seen online on Thursday that Capital Hill was posted by an unknown person, it was when the Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kawanough.
Some of the information from the three senators was being questioned on Kavanaugh due to the leak.
Hill says that from conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the address trick that identifies the source of the person posting, was reported to have been linked to the Waters office and an employee of Waters issued this information.
This allegation is completely baseless, wrong, and absolutely false,” Waters said.
Any of my employees – whose identity, personal information and security are being risked due to these false and false allegations – were in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This charge is baseless, completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters soon posted online for clearing criticism, including the former White House press secretary.
The reason for this rejection is anger,” Fletcher wrote.
This shows that their nature is not the kind that the Congress member should have.
When a charge is made against someone, they should not do so in anger.
They should not be rebellious.
They should not question the person who has made the allegations.
They should be calm and patient.”
It seemed that the response from Fletcher Waters was compared to the condemnation of the Democrats of Judge Kawanaugh, critics had accused Kawanaugh of being very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro had also tweeted on Twitter to tell his thoughts to lose the waters in midterm elections.
He tweeted, “If it’s true, it’s a big deal.”
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and the units that enforced the rules for these claims of fraud.
We will make sure that the criminals will be told about or not, and that they will be considered legally liable for all the work they have done, which is very bad and dangerous for any and all my employees,” he said.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - The act of espionage by Rowan Atkinson was not considered too powerful
The importance of Brexit is still traditionally seen in any new film from the British perspective and it appears to apply to this revival of that action-comedy spoof franchise of Johnny English which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was brought back in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Would we be self-spoken on how we certainly consider talking about the new export opportunity of the nation as nonsense?
Johnny English, with a pop approach at any rate and unqualified with a rubber face, has its license to recreate the stuff with a baseless foot – something that is much more famous than anything else than just its name, is the extensive comic creation for areas where non-English-speaking people live.
They are, of course, daft secret agents who managed to show Mr Bean’s Dash Cleo a little bit despite their bizarre pretensions in the smoothie glamour and are a dolop for that chap that contributed a single note to the charriot of fire theme tunes in the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is originally a traveler and is the international man Atkinson of mystery whose role he played in Barclaycard TV commercials except for Wake’s Chaos was forgotten.
Only one or two good scenes are seen in this new JE outing.
I loved Johnny English, in which it was shown to go to a helicopter wearing a medieval suit with armor and wrap the rotor blade on my helmet.
Performing physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but the laughter came very little and felt strangely half-hearted, especially the "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible offer themselves with full confidence as a component of comedy.
Laughter comes as if comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English’s funny misunderstandings are not tolerable at all, and Bean has liked Atkinson’s silent film more.
The always relevant thing is right now that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
The most secret network of UK spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, all UK working agents were identified on this network which could affect the agent's work - this is a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the brilliant and quite irritating Prime Minister, they are already struggling with many political and unpopularity problems: Emma Thompson can play this Quasi-Teressa-May character well, but the script is not too strong to work on this script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every working spy had compromised, he had to bring someone who had retired.
This means that Johnny English has to fight himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but is working on what an undercover operative should be doing apart from the record: it has some good comic stories, as well as teaching English at rock-type academy school by spy.
The Emergency for briefing has been sent back to English at Whitehall and Ben Miller's re-played role has been combined with his old, old, Ghadar's pained sydic Boff.
Boff is now married, he is trying to become a submarine commander, his role is that of Jolly-hockey-sticks in which Wiki Pepperdine has not been frozen.
Therefore, Batman and Robin find some huge mistakes in his Majesty's Secret Service when they encounter the beautiful famed cracked Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Cruelenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes to risk when it comes to the Keresmatic Technical Billionaire who claims that he has a solution to the UK computer crises: Papa Jason Volta played Jake Lacey.
English and Bog initiate their odyssey of the Fercial High-Zincs: fire a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle through Volta’s expensive boat; and English fully activates chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use Volta’s home interior.
The film has certainly been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but it’s still fine and entertaining, the whole movie has a lot of fun things for kids.
Fine-grained middle-class.
Also, as I saw in other Johnny English movies, in this film I could not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry according to his talent or not?
Labour has denied that it plans to work only four days a week for the UK people, but the money will be available five days later.
Jeremy Corbin’s Labour Party is considering becoming a democratic scheme in which UK residents will have to work only four days a week – but the money will be available for five days.
It is reportedly the party’s desire to give part of the savings that the company owns through Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee a three-day leave a week – but they will still be able to get the same salary.
Sources say that such an idea will be ‘good’ with the economic agenda of the party and it is planned to benefit the country workers.
A four-day shift is being promoted by the Trade Union Congress so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party employee from The Sunday Times said: 'Policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take place for a four-day working week, which is exactly conducive to the party’s outlook for the overall industrial strategy of the party as well as the rebalancing of the economy in favour of workers’.
The Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea, as it consists of a green party that promises a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
The four-day working week is not the policy of the party and it is not being considered by the party," a Labour party spokesperson said.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had used the last week’s labor conference to introduce his approach towards the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he has made sure that power is regained from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteers' in utility firms.
Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their entire stake back as the labour government can ‘cut’ based on alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create inclusive ownership funds for employees to be included in the company’s boards and hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms for employees who can get an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy, tells "60 Minutes" if cavannah checked by the FBI can change their mind
The FBI investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Cavanna delayed his final vote on his nomination in the Supreme Court for at least one week, and the question arises whether the Bureau findings helped withdraw his support to a Republican senator.
In an interview aired on Sunday, Scott Pelé, a correspondent of "60 minutes", asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was a possibility to find something by the FBI that would induce him to change his mind.
Kennedy appeared more clear than his colleague from South Carolina.
I think," Kennedy said.
I said that while going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavanna.
After this happened, when this charge came up, I called them, asked, ‘Did you do that?’
They were sure, determined, clear.”
However, Graham’s vote seemed to be a stone streak.
I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanna and this would require explosive accusations," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And whatever they named, he could not verify it.
This is a 36-year-old thing.
I don't see anything new change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday will host the New York, Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring many extremely impressive stars, and the same impressive mission; ending the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizen Festival will not only bring tens of thousands of people to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also serve to raise awareness of the true goal of the program of extreme poverty eradication by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the international advocacy group, the Global Poverty Project, which actively hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting against it.
In order to get free tickets for the program (except when you are not ready to pay the VIP ticket), concert goers must complete "actions" in many ways, such as becoming volunteers, emailing a world leader, calling a phone, or other meaningful ways to help create awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the rest of 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through free concerts the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is there just another case of the so-called "clickivism" - people feel like they are truly making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters while advancing efforts for various goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which are already distributed or fundraising.
The group estimates that safe funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, the participation of a UK-based investors and implementers who are committed to “helping children grow to their full potential”, promising Rwanda to provide $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
With the help of global citizens like the UK government, donors, the national government, and you, we can make malnutrition social injustice a footnote of history,” said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken by the government to call for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website “Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen replied: “This will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monai are one of the few performers performing at this year’s event in New York to host Debra-Lee Furnace and Hugh Jackman.
US may use Navy for “blockade” to create a barrier to Russian energy exports - Internal Secretary
Referred to by Washington Examiner, internal secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the U.S. Navy if "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinkey alleged that Russia work in Syria – in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
He reportedly said that "My reason for his presence in the Middle East is that he wants to brokerage energy, as he has done in the southern region of Europe, Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States has the ability to ensure with our Navy that sea routes remain open, and, if necessary, block, so as not to make sure their energy goes to the market,” he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of a nonprofit group program organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, who call themselves “the voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, he said, "in the case of Iran and Russia there is economic options, more or less, fuel leverage and replacement."
The statements are coming that the Trump administration, taking the place of Russia, is on a mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest alternative for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump themselves, tried to convince Germany to exit the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, who made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the current pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s widespread opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the idea that energy can not be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to select suppliers," Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry-leading organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Chemf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said, “I have great trouble when a large state intervenes in our energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the matter of joining the presidential race in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" the presidential race after the midterm election.
During the Town Hall in Holoch, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the race.
According to The Hill, he said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and add to our broken government and this includes having a woman at the top.”
After November 6, I will seriously consider contesting for the presidency."
Warren assesses President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, saying, "They are taking this county in the wrong direction.
I am absolutely concerned within what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanna have been vocal in criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to get an FBI check-up done before we vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren’s components do not think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pole, Massachusetts’ eighth percent of “potential” voters said Senators should not contest elections.
Thirty-two percent supported the contest in this way.
The survey showed more support in the case of contesting by former governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent supported possible inclusion in the election race and 48 percent were against it.
Other high profile Democratic names popular for potentially contesting elections until 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide until January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Cites Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump’s Rally
The 26-year-old track palin spent a year in Iraq after being enlisted in the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in the event of a domestic violence
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told the listener, “I am sympathetic to other families who feel the effect of PTSD and with wounds that our soldiers come back, because of what my son is feeling after he has come back.”
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said of his son and other retired soldiers, “They return with a slight change, they come back as harsh, they return thinking whether this honor is for him who is a sacrifice for his fellow soldiers and aircraft-drivers, and every other member of the army for the country.”
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wassila police department, he was arrested on Monday at Wassila in Alaska and accused of domestic violence and drug possession.
18 States, D.C. Support the Challenge of New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and Columbia Districts are supporting a new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims of gang escape or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and districts filed a justice-friendly synopsis on Friday in Washington to support a refugee challenging the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
He said that his partner "and his violent gang member sons" abused him, but the U.S. authorities rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence that create a large number of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision given by the immigrant appeal board allowing unorganised immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The new policy “looks over decades of state, federal, and international law,” District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Recine said in a statement on Friday.
The federal law expects that all asylum claims should be judged based on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a barrier violates that principle," the justice-friend said.
The attorney further argued in the letter that immigrants’ entry hurt the U.S. economy by refusing to say that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply essential labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide asylum to victims from domestic abuse and mass violence in June.
For those who leave their home because of harassment or fear due to their caste, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group, shelter is available,” the sessions said in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum never had to reduce all problems - even all serious problems - - whose people face every day around the world.
Aggressive rescue efforts in the Palu due to double the number of dead in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was highly serious.
It sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Reisa Kusuma, comforting a child suffering from fever at the exhaust centre of the town.
Every minute an ambulance brings the dead bodies.
Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen trying to save what they found, returning to their desolate homes, picking up submerged goods.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital sank in the grip of a magnitude earthquake.
Some injured people, including Dwi Haris, who were facing broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to constant strong earthquake shocks.
The shaking of violent earthquakes in his fifth floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter filled his eyes with tears.
We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was buried in the ruins of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for marriage.
I heard my wife crying for help, but then silent.
I don’t know what happened to him and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
US Ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ through ‘publicity advertisements’
A US daily newspaper accused Beijing of publicity using the US press, a week after the government Chinese newspaper mentioned the mutual benefits of the US-Chinese trade, a four-page advertisement.
US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s paid supplements in the Iowa’s most-selling newspaper – the Des Moines Register – after China accused it of trying to intervene in the Congress elections last Wednesday – November 6, China rejects the allegation.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections, US officials told Reuters that there was a new stage in Washington’s campaign to pressurise China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaging in a growing trade war that has seen them round the way to impose customs duties on each other’s imports.
Chinese and American experts say that the first Chinese vengeful customs in the trade war were designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican party.
Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses, said Terry Bransted, US ambassador to China and former Iowa-long governor, China, a leading exporter of agricultural goods.
China is now doubling that bullying by running promotional ads in our own independent press," Bransted wrote, expressing his opinion at Sunday's Des Moines Register.
In its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the U.S.-funded tradition of freelance and independent journalism, by placing paid advertisements in the Des Moines register," Branstead wrote.
Given that the media is locked in a strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the side of the road in Beijing here, you will get limited dissatisfactory voices and no correct reflection of the inconsistent opinions that Chinese people may have on China’s worrying economic curve line,” he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers avoided the pretext of a proposal to publish his article", although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are isolating female voters before the midterm election with the defeat of Cavanna, analysts warn
Since the top Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court candidates Brett Cavanna facing several allegations of sexual harassment, the analyst warns that they will see feedback, especially from women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
The emotions around it are quite fierce, and most Republicans are already showing up on the record that they want to move on with the vote.
Grant Rehar, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Rehar said he suspects that pressure would be enough to calm angry voters in the last minute for FBI investigation by Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona).
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for progressive group MoveOn on Friday, Carin Jean-Pierre said, "Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither tomorrow nor in November."
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to proceed with the nomination of Cavanna despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blessy Ford, protesters performing in the Senate hallway shouted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to withdraw from the chart," a non-political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“People are saying that this is already fierce; this is true.
But it can be more, especially among the female voters from the suburbs and the 18- to-29-year-old young voters who don’t vote often when the president doesn’t like.”
Analysts had already said before public testimony describing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee that it is likely to protest if Republicans proceed with affirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steel said, "This has become a confusing mess for GOP."
It's not just about placing a committee vote or final vote or cavanna on the bench, it's also related to the matter of how Republicans have handled it and how they have treated them," said Guy Cecil, director of the USA, an institution that helped Democrats elect, paid attention to the news channel.
However, Americans look somewhat divided in terms of who to believe in in the wake of Ford and Cavanna’s testimony, most of which seemed to favor Cavanna.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or potentially believe in Cavanna.
Additionally, 38 percent said that they felt that Cavanna had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least another petitioner, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee by taking oath last week that Kaivana assaulted him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the nominee of the Supreme Court displayed their genitals when they joined a party while reading at Yale in 1980.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet in comparison to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of Technology Legend, is a company that builds Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information will be allowed to access.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination".
We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data”.
The idea of Inrupt, according to John Bruce, the CEO of the company, is to bring resources, process, and proper skills by the company so that Solid can make it available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that she and her team " aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate the entire transformation, where all their business models will be completely over overnight.
We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burners-Lee Net neutrality has been an impressive voice in the debate.
Even when launching Inrupt, Burners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Von: WW1 Victoria Cross Clarique Celebrated
The only priest of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated 100 years in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard von won the award in an attack on 29 September 1918 in Bellanglize and Lehocourt.
However, they were killed by a sniper four days later and they never knew they had won the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at the parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Von, said that it was “brilliantly symbolic” that this level is being unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
On September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel von led his battalion in Canal de Saint-Quentin "amidst a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield", according to the London Gazette.
Later they headed towards the firing line and led the military-line before taking into hand the field-gun alone, with the "great heroism" and dashed the three-piece.
Lieutenant Colonel von on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended, was killed by a German sniper.
The 72-year-old Michael von said his grandfather’s adventures were “something I know can never match, but those we’re proud of.”
He and his brother Dr. James von also garlanded after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Von said that he was "feeling very honored to play a role in the parade" and said that "the heroism of a real hero is being demonstrated with the support given by many people."
MMA fans woke up all night to see Bellater 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you were awake to look at the plentiful Bellator 206 all night, but the main events were deprived of seeing.
San Jose had 13 matches in the bill, including six on the main card and live on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned by the conversion of coverage to the Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed, especially after staying awake until early morning for combat.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick prank".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator’s Senior Vice President Dave Schwartz said, “This was not suitable for 6 a.m. as per government regulation, so he had to switch to children’s programming.”
"" Peppa the Pig," "Yes."
Bellater Company President Scott Coker said they are going to work on their scheduling to engage the UK audience in the future.
I think when I think about replays, I think we’ll probably find a solution,” said Coker.
But there will then be six hours in Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday, their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, there was a lot of text moving when this change took place and they were not all compatible.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We'll limit it to five matches instead of six - like we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more for fans, it's just a little too much.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Deli feels 'innocent' in terms of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daily says that he became obsessed with the inferiority feeling towards everyone because of his sexuality – but he got the inspiration to be successful from it.
The 24-year-old Daily said she didn’t realize it until she reached secondary school that “everyone is not like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren Lavern, she said that she talks about gay rights to give others “hopeful.”
She also said that she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Cursty Young, has taken several months of leave due to the disease.
Upon appearing in the first program of Lavern as a socially-silent person, Deli said that she felt “lack” in herself than everyone else was because “it was socially not acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said: “Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are real things that have given me strength and strength to be able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was also “special”, he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when he finally came to know about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become the high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said that he spoke openly because he felt lucky when he was able to live openly without any trouble and he wanted to “hope” others.
The three-time world champion said that a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - was surprised when he fell in love with - "I was surprised."
Deli married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but she said that the age gap was never an issue.
When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that at such a young age it was difficult to find any one who went through the ups and downs of similar experiences.
The couple in June became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Deli, and Daily said that his "complete approach" had changed.
Had you asked me last year, it would have all been linked to ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
You know, there are many more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby."
His son’s name is similar to his father Robert, who died in 2011 after the diagnosis of brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daily said that his father did not admit that he was going to die and that the last time he wanted to know was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
He said, “I couldn’t tell them that you won’t be going to sit in the front row, dad.”
He said, “When they were unable to breathe, I held their hands and held on until their breaths were shut and they were dead, then I agreed that they were not invincible.”
The following year, Daily participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
I only knew that this was what I dreamed of throughout my life – diving into the Olympic Games in front of a crowd of homeland, there was no better feeling than that,” she said.
It also inspired his favorite first song - Proud by Heather Small - that resonated with him during the preparation of the Olympics and hearing which still stands his robes.
Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mickelson out of Saturday’s Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must change his form to prevent it from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
While playing at the biennial event for the 12th time record, Mickelson was put out of the game by Captain Jim Furique for Saturday's Foreballs and Foursomes.
Instead of becoming a hotspot, as he has often remained for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day working in the hope of living among those cheering and improving the weaknesses of his playing method.
Not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old has never been the ideal fit for the tit Le Golf National Course, where those who are not active for a long time regularly get the penalty of wrong shots.
And while the same course isn’t that easy, in Sunday’s ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played together with Rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If American players, starting four points below the 12 singles match, start strongly, the match of Mickelson can prove to be very important.
He trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
He fully understood his role, patted my back and encircle me in his arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
He is very confident in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine playing two of her matches.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way and the way we thought we had to move on.
He wants to go out there just like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the highest-played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This rider can mark the end of the cup career that has never touched the heights of their personal records.
Mickelson has found 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven halfs, although Furic said his appearance brought some intimacy to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
I think that young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big edge may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from his experience that the last-day single in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dane made his first appearance in the 1997 match in Valderama, where one side under the captaincy of Seve Ballestiros had achieved a five-point lead over Americans, but with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2, with the lowest margin, just reached the finishing line.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, we were just able to win,” Bjorn said in mind, after seeing the 2018 class a 10-6 lead from Friday 5-3 and tomorrow at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that it is not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get there and do all the right thing.
It doesn’t end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's trying to win this trophy and that's where to maintain focus.
I’ve always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re well aware that the greatest players around the world – stand on the other side.”
Bjorn further stated how his players performed on a tough golf course: “I will never be able to overtake myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow personal performances will come forward, and this is a different matter.
It's great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you get out there in person, your ability as a golfer is thoroughly tested.
This is the message you need to deliver to players to demonstrate your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and give his best performance too."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite standing Jim Furic would be personally wishing better performance for his players than he did as a partner, the exception was Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Prior to facing defeat by Europe due to the “miracle in Medina” taxing, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furic himself has been at both ends of those big last days’ recursion.”
In response to his questioning, "I remember every one of his legs," he said in 1999, how Captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to start the kind of fast you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set our line-up according to ourselves and included people like we felt, you know, we’re trying to do some more miracles tomorrow.”
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the counterattack with Rory McLauro in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Raham, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter are the top half of the other European order.
I grouped them in this order because I think it covers everyone," Bjorn said about his single selections.
Germany’s new warship postponed again
The German Navy new warships should have been commissioned to replace the warships of the period-affected cold war-era warships in 2014, but due to faulty systems and fast-growing costs, at least this will not happen until next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Pulz", which is the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Wurtemberg-class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel should have joined the navy in 2014, but issues that bothered after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Beden-Wurtemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought as a replacement for the Kaal-affected Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will facilitate an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared, and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period – it is possible to deploy the latest warships for up to two years from indigenous ports.
However, continued delays mean that state-of-the-art warships — which could allow Germany to have a power project abroad — would become timeless until the period of entering service, Die Zine commented.
Durdt F125 warships made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned the Blohem and Voss shipyards to Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery to a ship.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but German media cited several important "software and hardware defects", which would make the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The lacks of software were particularly important because the Baden-Wurtemberg-class ships would be driven by crews of some 120 sailors — just half the manpower of old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Reenland-Pulz" is considered twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including crew training – is becoming an issue.
It is said that it has reached the initial €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6bn).
The problem of new warships that became particularly important in the light of recent warnings is gripping the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that "the deployment-enabled ships are coming to an end" in the Navy.
The official said that this issue has become serious over time, as older ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were provided.
He said none of the Baden-Wurtemberg-class warships were able to join the navy.
National Trust is secretly listening to the secret lives of bats
The new research being carried out in an estate in Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their prey for food.
It is expected that the findings will put new light on the behavior of unique mammals flying and will help direct future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrels, as well as brown-long-earned and dobbenton bats nestled in the Inverway Garden of Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings reveals the frequency of a bat call and what species are doing.
Then a detailed landscape-scale depiction of their behavior will be prepared for the natural-vas map and report.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation consultants, hope the results show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-habit management functions such as the construction of the meadow and how to maintain the woodlands well for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK has declined significantly in the last century
They are prone to construction and development operations, which affect bird bases and harm natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also pose risks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey due to their hunting habits.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to indicate defects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land care across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly observe surveys, bird bases, and sometimes save them.
The organization has set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated Bat Reserve at Threeve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland’s home to eight of the ten bat species.
Estate Manager David Thompson says that estate is a great place for him.
Here at Threeve we have a great area for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees, and all good natural habitats.
But there is much that is still unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand what they need to thrive."
They emphasize the importance of checking bats before maintaining within the properties because it is possible that unknowingly the maternity maternity base can destroy 400 females and infants, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their bases.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
We still have a lot to learn about our bats and we still don’t know how their population is growing,” he said.
Ronaldo dismisses rape claims while lawyers sued German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape claims against him "false news" saying that people want to "publicize themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
Portugal and Juventus forward are accused of raping a U.S. woman named Catherine Mayorga in the hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Dere Spiegel reported on Friday that she reportedly paid $375,000 to the woman to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing its 142 million followers in Instagram live video after reporting claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo described reports as “false news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but it’s part of their work.
I'm a happy person and all is fine," the player smiled and said.
Ronaldo lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for allegations that he has called "doubted invalid reporting in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
The lawyer Christian Shertz said that players would “recompense compensation for moral damage in the amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of Las Vegas’ Palms hotels and casinos.
Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room after meeting in a nightclub, according to papers filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada, where they allegedly raped him.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that they were "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had also taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to the agreement outside the court as she felt "troubled by vengeance" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to abolish this agreement as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer made a deal of €100 million with Italian legend Juve.
Brexit: U.K. to lose carmaker 'will regret forever'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that the UK will “repent forever” if he loses his title as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said that Toyota U.K. had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernstone near Derby.
We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said border delays in the situation of no-deal Brexit could have an impact on jobs.
The Bernstone plant – which forms the orris and avensis of Toyota – produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
I believe that if Britain exits the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota in Bernstone.
Other UK car manufacturers have apprehended about leaving the EU without consenting to how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover will work.
For example, BMW says that it will close its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of a supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts from made-to-order cars every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the European Union without any deal on March 29, there may be disruption on the border, according to the industry which may lead to delays and shortages of spares.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to have an inventory of more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so the production would be discontinued.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May’s Checkers plan for future relations with the European Union is “calibrated purely to avoid those checks on the border.”
We want a great deal that not only can I think of currently enjoy success, but it is also necessary to achieve this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have received evidence that we should be able to continue with it completely which has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be discontinued, but in the long term, warned that additional costs would lower the plant’s competitiveness and eventually leave jobs.
Peter Sauvallris, who has worked in Bernstone for 24 years and is the convener of the Unite Union at the plant, said that his members are highly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they never come back after bed.
We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union," a government spokesperson said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may again be delayed, according to the White House
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump’s deputy attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s high-stakes meeting could be postponed to “another week later” as the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanna’s struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election intervention, the relationship between Trump Assistant and Russia, and the possible hurdle of justice by the President.
Trump will or will not remove the Deputy Attorney General, and leading to Muller’s independence being threatened, the news has warmed up Washington’s market of rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of applying a wire to record negotiations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, they went to the White House amid reports that they would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that he would not "like" the removal of Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid the conflict of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that Cavannah and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Cavanna, delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was seen on Sunday on Fox News.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “The date for this is not set, it may be this week, I can see that the sight of all other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed one more week ahead.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held White House press talks since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that briefing was not lacking because of the "gorgeousness" of TV reporters, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are gorgeous."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
Not citing evidence," she said, "the president has more questioning sessions than any other president," she said: "we've seen those numbers."
Briefing will still happen, Sanders said, but "If the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly questions, it's better than talking to me.
We try very hard to do this and you have seen us doing this a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to replace the press talks."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or when attending open sessions or in a press conference with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president displayed bebaq and a number of times unique presence in front of journalists present, perhaps why.
Health Secretary NHS writes about Brexit’s fears to EU workers in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU employees working in the NHS of Scotland with a wish to express the country’s gratitude and their stay after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter due to less than six months from the EU over the withdrawal of the UK.
The Scottish government is already committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens working in their degraded public services.
In his letter, Miss Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, moving towards the expected decisions in this autumn.
But the UK government is also pushing its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know it must have been a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That is why I now wanted to repeat how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The EU, and beyond, bring with peer, valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we very want you to stay here.”
Cristian abercrombie emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers Linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who lost to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday 31-27, conducted emergency surgery after a head injury, Tennessee Mike Organon reported.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury took place just a while before Hofftime.
He came to the shore and just fell there," said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave oxygen to the abercrombie on the sideline before placing it on the stretcher and taking it back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Eberdromby has come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "no details are available on the type/limit of injury yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury was hit.
Abercrombie, which is Redshirt Sophomore, is in its first season with the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which led to his season totaling 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be charged from foreign buyers while buying property in the U.K.
Foreign buyers will be charged high stamp duty when buying property in the UK, which will be used to help homeless under the new Tory schemes.
This step will neutralize the success of Corbin’s campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
Treasury expects it to help homeless - raise up to £120 million in a year
Foreign buyers are preparing to charge a high stamp duty rate when buying property in the UK – the extra cash that will be used to help homeless people will announce today at Theresa.
This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s campaign that attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
Stamp duty hikes will be imposed on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the added money the government will promote a campaign to deal with goldsmiths under odd circumstances.
Surcharge – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two homes and rental purchases introduced two years ago, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury expects a recovery of up to £120 million in a year.
Estimatedly 13 percent of newly-built London properties are purchased by non-UK residents, making it difficult for buyers of the first time to put their foot on the housing ladder.
Many wealthy regions of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because there are more foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp duty cuts with the intention of helping more youth build their first home.
He accused big construction firms of bringing a bounce in property prices by grabbing land but not using them, and urged Mrs May to leave a quota at affordable homes to fix Britain’s “housing sell”.
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and the end of "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more authority to the councils for the construction of new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our sedentary housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as well as foreign-based companies as buying a house for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of ownership of the house has become a far cry, and the fury of gold is extremely real under extreme circumstances."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland’s boss Jack Ross says his “final ambition” is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently ranked third in League One, and which is three points away from the top.
They moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer of this year after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's sportsground.
But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father since childhood, and it has always been something that draws me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poet, and Paulo di Canio.
The former Eloa athletic boss says they didn’t feel any nervous about following established names in a big club that had previously rejected the initiative of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, "Can I guess success for me if I can return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and features of this club, it undoubtedly comes in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably see myself as being successful here if I can get the club there."
Ross’s management career has just been three years since he spent 15 months as an assistant boss of Dumberton and in Hart’s coaching staff.
He then helped Eloa recover from the fall of the third tier, and changed St. Mirren from the brink of the fall of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they feel more comfortable now than they did during their careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton academics.
This was probably the real crossroads," he said in terms of taking over Alaoah.
"I really believed that management was a more perfect fit for me than playing.
It seems bizarre because I did fine work, earned a fair amount of money from it, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but all seems fine in terms of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it makes me feel most comfortable throughout my adult life."

The exact time for A Pint is Saturday at 5.30 pm, found in the survey
Summer Tapish has promoted the UK’s struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on the restaurant’s chains.
Pub and Bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 percent, statistics showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles data, said: "July means that in the month of last June, the pubs were up 2.8 percent, except that the restaurant faced even more difficulties than expected participation in the constant sunshine and England World Cup.
Restaurant business declined by 1.8 per cent in June to worsen in July.
The wine selling pubs and bars performed the strongest with more preference than restaurants.
Food-operated pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems that people only wanted to go out to drink.
The sales of all pubs and bars for the month increased by 6.6 per cent, while food prices declined by three per cent," he said.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sports events makes the biggest factor for sale in the outdoor market.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, although sales will be painful, with a 4.8 per cent decline year-on-year, especially due to current cost pressures.
The long summer season could not have been a bad time and a bad time at the operators of food items, and the time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide the much-needed relief.”
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those that opened new in July, was 2.7 percent, reflecting a slower pace in brand roll-out.
The Cofer Peach tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups performing with a combined turnover of £9 billion, monitoring industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, and is the established industry benchmark.
One of the five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
The survey shows that one of the five children – some under 11 young – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
20,000 secondary school students survey revealed an increase in "fake insta" pages
The apprehension has increased from the news that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
One of the five children - some under 11 young - are creating social media accounts that they remain secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students increased rapidly in "fake insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.
The apprehension has increased from the news that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clear “main” account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site found a teenager in it urging others to “rape me.”
Independent schools’ research by the “Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters” and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-old children had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
It’s a very irritating thing that many teenagers are tempted to make online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them,” said Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC.
Elidh Doyle will be the "Voice for Athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most graceful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty described this move as a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to benefit from his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Eleeed has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK, and World Athletics community and we are sure that bringing athletics to board in Scotland will benefit a lot," Beatty said.
I’m eager to serve as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland,” Doyle said.
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans winning 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and now regular BBC Pundits became unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a trauma.
I can’t walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I will recover and exactly to what extent I can be.
It was a horrific job, but fully learned to recover, walk again and practice agility today!
Thank you for messages of encouragement!"
Comparison of mothers cows by breast pump advertising created differences in opinion of people online
A breast pump company splits the opinion online by an advertisement that compares lactating mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called the "world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-inspired advertisement, giving new pump mothers the freedom to express.
Four real mothers in a barn full of cows grass dance to a song that includes some words like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "if you haven't noticed these are not narrations, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Them Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, advertising, published on the firm’s Facebook page, has caused an online dispute.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the audience, many people said that it offers the "awesome" of the dairy industry in a light manner.
Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
As soon as we need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them in a few days after giving birth,” one wrote.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly within nursing bra (Elvie/mother)
Another note: "Of course painful for both mother and infant.
But why not use them for breast pump advertising for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their children?”
Someone else added: "How irrelevant advertising is."
Others defended the ad, one of which the woman said that she found the song of that ad "funny."
I think this is a great idea.
I would also have it, if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping makes me feel absolutely a cow.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a great product".
The other remarked: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and feel like “cow”.
It's not a dairy industry promoter or a decisive advertisement."
At the end of the video, a group of women told her that she kept pumping carefully in her bra and dancing.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women say that women who pump breast feels like they are a cow.
However, the elvi pump remains well hidden, has no wire or tube and directly fits into a nursing bra carefully, giving women the freedom to roam, catch their children, and even go out without pumping.
Anna Ballerina, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, entitled to a steaming and spectacular launch.
By outlining the parallel between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, showcasing a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way that will bring new pumps.
This is not the first time that Elvi Pump has been in the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, was seen catwalking for designer Marta Jacobsky.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The caught migrant children were spied on, even when there was no relative change in the monthly border crossings, to some extent because the harsh curvature and policies offered by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hire children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had appointed undocumented migrants and were afraid to endanger their own ability to live in the country by further claiming any child.
The threat increased further in June, when federal rights announced that potential sponsors and other adults or older members of the household will have to provide their fingerprints and the data will then be shared with immigrant authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior officer of immigration and customs enforcement, submitted evidence to Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsoring cohesive minors.
The agency later confirmed that there is no criminal record of 70 percent of those arrested already.
About 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household live illegally in the country and the maximum of them are criminals.
That’s why we continue to search for those individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
Seeking to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which the children were required to appear in the court within a month of being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the asylum staff.
Many people appear through video conference calls rather than being personally present to an immigrant judge to present their case for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit to free are immediately fired.
The longer captives children remain, the more likely they are to be restless or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or escape attempts according to conservation staff and system reports in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a higher facility like tornillo, where the signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
At the same time, he said that taking children to the tent city without giving enough time to get emotionally ready or saying goodbye to friends will increase the shock with which he is already struggling even more.
Syria asks US, French, and Turkey to return military forces immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also asked refugees from Syria to come back home, even when the country was now the eighth year of the war.
Maulam, who also works as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces illegally live on the land of Syria in the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly."
They should immediately and unconditionally go back from the battle ground,” he told the assembly.
Moulam insisted that the “war has almost ended” in Syria where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several millions were uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this “superhuman war until we clear all the terrorist groups and all the Syrian regions of “the presence of a foreigner.”
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, primarily training and mentoring both Khurdish and the Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in the destruction country due to the war.
On the case of refugees, Moulam said that the circumstances were fine for his return and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading the fear of worthless", which prompted refugees to stay away.
We called international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this return,” he said.
They were politicizing on a completely human matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not receive any aid for rebuilding until there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United States politician says that, a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the citadel of Idlib’s last major uprising creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement deferred an attack mass by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province where three million people lived.
However, Moulam said the agreement had a "clear timeline" as well as expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors from Nusra Front, who would be "wiped out."
The United States representative’s transferee Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and the opposition to prepare the post-war constitution to soon fix the route to Syria and elections.
Moulam put some conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which states that the work of the panel should be restricted to “review articles of the current constitution” and warn against interference.
Why Trump Will Win in Second Term
With that argument, Mr. Trump will win the election again in 2020, unless many generous or noble persons are expecting any accusations and scams to end his tenure ahead of time.
Undoubtedly “This will be the most dramatic conclusion of the national post ever!”
So far, no exhaustion was visible in the audience.
Since 2014, more than twice as much as 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times on MSNBC have increased to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers over 1.7 million in the past four years, and MSNBC’s “The Reshal Mado Show” found the highest position by garnering 3.5 million viewers in cable ratings with major news airing at night.

Entertainment had value in the chaos.
Absolutely, stories coming out of Washington, on TV and beyond, can determine the future of Row V. Wade, the unity of immigrant families, and the health of the global economy.
Only the privileged audience could afford to ignore it.
And yet, it goes beyond being an aware citizen, when you find yourself seeing a six-hour debate of a panel of experts, using the root cause of Woodward "Deep Background" for your book "Fear", Paul Manafort’s $15,000 bomber jacket ("a thick cloth with hebris" said Washington Post) and the implication of Mr. Trump’s description of the Anatomy by Stormy Daniels.
I will never see Super Mario like that anymore.
As part of what he does, which makes it exactly like a reality show where he brings something new to you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, creator of Wheelhouse Entertainment and “Pon Stars”, about the rotating cast of Trump’s show and the plot twist of Rose (selecting a feud, Kim Jong-un’s praise from N.F.L.,).

I remember when we were doing all that silly or agitated show in those days and people said "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flas told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but later found out that they were right."

In the race of the election house, there was a flood of external money in the strong middle post.
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, thanks to the re-construction of the Congress board, due to which two officials came out for the same seat race.
Who recently opened the front for the democratic rap conner lamb of suburban Pittsburgh district – who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
Lamps were also involved in a second-post race, the Republican Cath Rothfus, which currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
After this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in terms of unconstitutional counterfeiting in favour of Republicans by old districts, maps or maps were recreated.
In the new 17th race, the empty-handed battle between major finance armaments, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) touched the campaign’s economy.
Lamb’s name became quite prevalent in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory that was widely seen in the March special election of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
For this reason, the seat had been occupied by Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump had won that district by 20 points.
Political pundits provoked democracies a little more.
Punishing El Salvador to support US China, then retreat
Diplomats mentioned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varella of Panama in June 2017 and stayed in a hotel in Panama until the management team of the Trump Organization removed the partners.
Earlier this month, department spokesperson Haider Nort said in a statement that "the recent decision to no longer recognise Taiwan", officials of the state department decided to withdraw the diplomatic mission heads from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama.
But only El Salvador was punished, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including the Narcotics Control, Development and Economic Assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cutting financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, will be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and killing rates.
When progressed at internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow that aggregation or public group similar to the previous year, which was seen as a move taken forward as an effort to prevent immigrants from the United Nations.
But by mid-September, the top administration authorities made it clear that they want the conference to go ahead and effectively end up considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
The Deputy President Mike Pence is now set to address the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative places to the conference, the diplomats said.
And three Americans returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic quietly without a harsh message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate or debate described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal discussions on the condition of non-clarification of the name.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration as well as speaks on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next case could be Mr. Trump’s report on potential resistance to justice by the Special Council Robert Muyler, of which there is now enough evidence in public records.
At the same time, Mr. Muayler changes his direction of investigation according to the report that if Mr. Trump’s campaign colludes with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in the body when he prepares himself to go before the voters again and perhaps before a jury of his co-workers.
That is, a lot if or if and I don’t mean signalling or suggesting that Mr. Trump’s collapse of his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose from on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can be.
In 1938, German officials were willing to make a move against Hitler, only if he was resisted from the West and Czechoslovaky in Munich supported him.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the genocide of so many years.
The methodology of historical focal points around such points of expression and the inflexible march of democracy is expedited or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump dethrones the deputy attorney general Rod Rosentine, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Muyler’s investigation, what will we do?
The Rosentine has been confused since last year this paper reported it, he suggested secretly keeping the president’s record and considering his being unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenteen said The Times account is not accurate.
If the recently requested Brett Kwangoh’s F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair – or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite authentic charges of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we react?
And beyond all this, will we vote for Congress in the medium term for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will last until the long winter.
But I think we won’t fail because of the lesson I’ve learned in Preg.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, who had previously also captured my envoy home once.

Graham Doron’s Rangers are optimistic even after the intense Vienna encounter
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month, winning over Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify in the group G of the Europe League.
Knee injury prevents midfielder Graham from appearing first in a session of up to 2-2 with Villareal, but she believes that Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
This was a good thing for us because Villareal was good", said the 31-year-old.
We proceeded to the game with the belief that we could achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the draw will likely have a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving to Thursday, it is a second major European night.
Hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with our rear crowd or masses in their previous game, I am sure we will play good and get positive results.
Whatever happened to my injuries and changes made to the club itself with the previous year was definitely difficult but now there is good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully we can now leave our previous session behind and move on and succeed."
Women are losing their sleep for fear of saving this retirement.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it with their family members.
More than half of people across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they spoke to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but he doesn’t take any steps to interact” said holi cinder, life insurance business vice president across the country.
Here’s where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare your family to take care of them if you don’t tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your advisor and your family where and how to get care, as that option can be important factors in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor. Your advisor can also give you tips on how to pay those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-price life insurance policy, to help pay these expenses or insure your own health, as long as you have money.
Introduce your legal documents. Make your legal battle easier.
Get a healthcare proxy, so you hire a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, professionals follow your desires.
Also, consider the attorney’s right to inspect your finances.
You will select a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and ensure that your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don't forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medicines and allergies?

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami in the city of Indonesia on Friday killed at least 384 people and the number of deaths is expected to increase even further, officials said.
When communication was stopped, rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern region of Palu that is near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the devastation.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, which is located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated 379,800 population in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami knocked down, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
There is a regency on the beach to the northwest of the island of Dongala Sulawesi, which extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) to the area.
Below the administrative province is an estimated population of 299 in the Regency, which was 200 in 2017.
The mainstay of the economy of the central Sulawesi province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but he focuses in Morovli on the opposite shores of the maximum Sulawesi.
The tsunami in Palu and Dongala has knocked several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, in Dongala, more than 200 lives were lost due to tsunamis and hundreds of homes were ruined.
In 1996, Tsunami knocked down even in the western Dongala, in which nine people were killed.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire from a seismic point of view and suffers regular earthquake strikes.
Here’s about the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: Tsunami occurred in 14 countries due to a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s AK province on December 26, killing 226,000 people on the coastline of the Indian Ocean, half of which were in the AK.
2005: A series of intense earthquakes also struck the western coasts of Sumatra in early March and April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias on the banks of Sumatra.
2006: Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, a tsunami of 6.8 magnitude activating a tsunami, which exploded on the south coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude near the city of Padang affected the region which is the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude affected the area on the island of Mentawai on the coast of Sumatra, which led to dozens of villages ravaged and killed around 300 people in the tsunami that struck the area up to 10 meters.
2016: A shallow water earthquake in the AK attacked the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and stampede as it reminded people of the 2004 terrible earthquake and the destruction or devastation of tsunamis.
There were no tsunamis this time, but more than 100 people died due to the fall of buildings or buildings.
2018: Intense earthquakes devastated everything on the tourist island of Lombok’s Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern direction of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made thousands of tourists helpless for some time.
Sarah Pelin's elder son arrested for domestic violence
Track Pelin, Eastern Alaska Ruler and Deputy Chairman candidate Sarah Pelin’s eldest son was arrested for assaulting.
Wasila, Alaska’s 29-year-old Pelin, was arrested for molestationing and protesting against domestic violence reports, in suspicion of domestic violence, according to reports released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman familiar person tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he would take a phone from her.
According to the KTUU report, Pelin was sent back to the Mott-su Pretrial facility as well as fined 500 dollars of unsecured bonds.
The network report reported that it appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for arguments.
Pelin faced three A-class criminals, where he could be punished for up to one year and fined $250,000.
At the same time, he is charged under a sentence of one day in jail and a crime of class B with a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal cases have been registered against Pelin.
In December 2017, she was criminalized to attack her father Todd Pelin.
His mother, Sarah Pelin, called the police to report the alleged invasion.
The case is currently before the Court of Alaska veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of obstructing domestic violence, domestic violence reports, and of holding a weapon being drunk with regard to the incident.
Her girlfriend alleged that she had punched her face.
After connecting his son’s violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq, Sarah Pelin was criticized by a group of experienced individuals in 2016.
Earthquake tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people were killed after tremors at the island of Indonesia in Sulawesi on Friday.
This 7.5-intensity earthquake activated the tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Along with increasing mortality rates in the coming days, electricity and communication networks were also not working.
The earthquake attacked central Sulawesi, which is the north eastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
The videos showing the impact on social media were circulating.
Thousands of people gathered for the Beach Festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death penalty for a suspected NYC attack
Federal charger Saifulo in New York is seeking rare death penalty for cypov, suspected of a terror attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a sparse punishment to be inflicted in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, uses a home depot rental truck allegedly to invade the bike on the way to the western direction highway in Manhattan below, cutting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to a notice of intention to demand a death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Cypov has “deliberately” killed eight victims and “deliberately” injured them physically.”
These two countries potentially give death penalty as per the court document.
A week after the invasion, a federal grand jury hit Cypov for 22 charges, including eight murder charges to aid racketeering, which are used exclusively in organized crime cases and by federal chargers in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The prosecutors said that the invasion needed to "have enough planning and prior discussions", explaining the manner in which Cypov carried it out in a "abominable, cruel, and wicked" manner.
Safulou Habbuelvic Cypov has injured and harmed the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clevus Enlor Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hernan Feroqui, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco," reported.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The lawsuit on past death penalty case in South District of New York has been going on for a decade.
The Mulzim Khalid brain was found guilty of murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, the New York Federal Case for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg was last sentenced to death penalty, a married couple found guilty of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Joan Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair in June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Cypov had no guilt or regret for days and months after the invasion according to court documents.
The police said he told the investigators that he liked everything he did.
Cypov told the authorities that he was inspired to invade after watching videos of ISIS meeting crime on his phone.
The police said it also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He requested not to blame himself for the 22-calculation of crime.
David Patton is one of the federal public patrons representing Cypov, who says they are "clearly disappointed" by the charger's decision.
We think that our decision to ask for a death sentence instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being free would only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone,” Patton said.
Cypov’s defense team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farz should be made chargeee for Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to ‘collect an army of people’ during the protest at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern Euchip leader asked politicians to ‘understand the atmosphere’ from the Euroscaptics – because Theresa May’s one of the own MPs suggested that they should interact with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told March in Birmingham that if Mr. Faraz was Brexit Secretary, Britain must have ‘out’ so far.
But the challenges faced by Mrs May in solving their extremely divided rank are outlined by Pro-Rimen Tory to add a different protest against Brexit in the city.
Premier Brexitier is struggling to keep his checker’s agreement plan on track during attacks from Remmenar and the European Union.
The colleagues urged that she would try to compromise with Brussels instead of backlash - and force the Euroscaptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone said that leaving means leaving the rally in Solih, in which he wants to ‘throw checkers’.
She suggested that Mr. Faraz should become a partner and be given the responsibility of interacting with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out so far’, he said.
Wellingboro’s MP or MP said: ‘I will stand up for Brexit but we need to pull out checkers.’
Setting up its opposition in the European Union, he said: ‘We don’t have to be under anyone to fight a world war.’
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bon rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British people have changed their views and want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkins was also in March stating: 'I am only saying this: Prime Minister, listen to people.
The checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our workers who actually encircle the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Mrs, she said: The Prime Minister maintains her jobs when they don’t break their promise.”
Mr. Faraz said that rally leaders should be 'realised' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is now the case between us - the people and our political classes', he said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and today we have come here to tell them, ‘We won’t let you escape by doing this.’
Conveying to the enthusiastic crowd, he said: ‘I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of deceiving Brexit while understanding the atmosphere.
We are organizing the army of people of this country who have led us to victory in Brexit and who do not rest until we become a free, self-government and proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Reimeners march from Birmingham before rallying two hours in the middle of the city.
A gang of activists pointed to Tories against the Brexit banner after the launch of this weekend group.
Labour Peer Lord pretends to have conversations for security issues from the party app when the Adonis Conference opens.
It’s the people who tell us that they can have a reasonable IT system for Canada, a borderless border, and a borderless free trade in Ireland, and all technology.
It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Waran plans to adopt a 'strict view' on President's operations

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton concludes world title after team victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas deserves to play a big role in the "Louis Hamilton Mercedes" team order race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and kicked out Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vettel to hinder the drivers of his team.
Vettel first went to Pitts and left Hamilton in traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was behind a lap and came out from behind the wettle but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw Ferrari’s driver reluctantly defended at the third corner leaving free with no risk after a double-move.
Max Verstappen started with the previous line of the grid and was seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
Then he moved on to a large part of the race when he targeted his attention to changing his tires in it and quickly overtaken the fourth place by KM Raconen.
He finally, got into pitts on the 44th lap but was unable to speed up the remaining eight laps, when Reconne secured the fourth place.
It was a hard day when Valttery did great work throughout the weekend and a really great gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by achieving one or two, Hamilton said.
It really was very bad gestures
President Donald Trump falsely pretended to Senator Diane Feinstein on his request on Saturday, not leaking the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kawanagua of sexual abuse.
When speaking at a rally in Western Virginia, the President did not directly address the narration letter given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he remarked on the current situation of the Senate saying that people are “meaning and evil and dishonest.”
A very good thing or thing that can happen in the last few days in the Senate when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people, he said.
When you look at the release and leaks and then they say "Hey, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak...No, we didn’t leak, he said pointing to the Senator.
Feinstein was sent back in July a letter from Ford detailing the allegations made against Kavanagua and it was leaked in early September – but Finestein refused to deny that it had been leaked to the office.
I didn't hide doctor Ford's charges, I didn't leak his story," Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
He told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential according to what he said.”
But the president didn’t find his rejection fair, who remarked at the Saturday night rally: “I tell you that this was really a very bad gesture.
Maybe he didn’t do it, but I’ve rarely seen such bad body language before.”
Continuing the defence of the Supreme Court candidate, the three women who have been accused of sexual misconduct, the President pointed out that Democrats were using charges on their behalf.
They are set to withdraw power through any necessary means.
You see their meanness, filthiness, and also that they don’t care about who they hurt or who they are running behind to get power or power or control,” the mediator reported to the president’s words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giant by winning a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giant initially gained two goals through attacks from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beauillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan brought to the home side level before re-establishing Crownie Dior before the Giant's lead.
Frankos Bouchard equaled it for Dundee before Lukas Lundwalt Nielsen secured two goals from victory.
It was the third Elite defeat of the season for Adam Kiefe’s male, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With Giant winning the last three matches, it was the fourth session meeting on the sides.
Dwyer's opener candle came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of McFall, in which David Rutherford helped Beaulier double the lead in the subsequent four minutes.
In the busy early period, Sullivan demonstrated his home play back to 13:10 before Matt Marquadrate equals the county at 15:16.

Air traffic controller was killed in ensuring that hundreds of people could escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is greeted as a hero or hero since he died in ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can be safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many more missing after the major earthquake attack activating the tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The postoperative traumas in the area continued to perpetuate and many people were trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
But when her associates were running to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Egang refused to leave his post he was busily controlled at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, landed safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he felt it was about to fall.
She later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtrate, said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikappan in Kalimantan to take them from another city to the big hospital.
Unfortunately, we lost them even before the helicopter reached the palate.
His departure broke our heart,” he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll with the destruction of the country can reach thousands, with the implication agency saying that access to Dongala, Siggy and Botonsh is limited.
Death rates may still increase because many bodies may still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places where cannot be reached," said Sutopo Nughroho, the agency's spokesperson.
The waves that rose up to six meters destroyed the palu, causing a mass burial on Sunday.
Army and commercial aircraft are bringing assistance and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance used to carry dead bodies.
Getting clean water is rare.
Small markets were looted everywhere.”
Jain Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “Indonesia is running to help red cross organisms, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it can be even more bad."
Indonesia President Joko Widodo reached Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to withdrawal or emptying.
Are you ready?” the CNN reported.
In Indonesia earlier this year, there was an earthquake in Lobonk, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nugini now tells that a man has been missing since the lagoon plane crash
The airline operating the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia now says that a man is missing, when the last time it was reported that 47 passengers and crew were evacuated safe from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said he was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not respond urgently to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
When the plane fell into the water while attempting to land at the missed island airport, local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in a stable position now.
How the cause and event of the crash happened is ambiguous.
The airline and the US Navy say that both the aircraft did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought the plane did not even land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come down a lot.
This is an extremely good thing" said Jane.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water from the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the plane staff were nervous and shouting and he got a minor injury on the head.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby to improve the ghat also helped rescue people in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water using an aired boat to bring them to shore before the plane sinks.
Data from the aviation security network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of the PNG-registered airline in the last two decades but no one was involved in the air nuiguni.
The analyst told the night when the woman was burnt alive
The prosecution reinstated its case on Saturday to sue a man again on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Analyst Paul Rowett’s department presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
He told the jury how he had used a cellphone record to bring together the activities of the 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
Rowlatt said she received location data from several cellphones, which shows that her previous claims were refuted with Talis Chambers in the evening, reported by The Clarian-Laser.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michel Sanford, his cellphone was near the chambers at the time, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and submitted further evidence that he was not in the city that day.
Asked by the prosecutors if Tally is telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “ lying because his truck was in Nashville.”
The second incompatibility was that Talis said he knew the chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cellphone records show that they knew each other for a week.
After some time of Chamber’s death, Tally has removed all the text or message, call, or contact information of the Chamber from its phone, Rowlett said.
Hell said, “He blotted him out of his life.”
Rescue sides are ready to start their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to go to the jury to hear the trial that day.

The second black person?!
NY Nanny Sues Couple couple after firing after "caste" text
A New York nanny sues a couple couple for biased shooting after a mother complains that she is a "second black person".
Couple couples reject that they are prosecutors, suing for "absorption".
Linci Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, finds out that Giselle, who took care of new children, expresses her babysitter to Morris, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text "No other black person".
However, instead of sending it to her husband, it sent it twice to Ms. Morris.
According to a New York post, after realizing his mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that his outgoing Nanny, who was African-American, has done a bad job and that he is expecting a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Borer by paying her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a job withdrawal on the couple and a compensation of $350 per day for six months, although in live-in gig he was appointed to start work without any contract.
See “I want to show them that you don’t do such a thing” he said in a post on Friday, stating that “I know it is discrimination”.
The couple on claims that they are casteists, stating that they cannot trust him after insulting him, it was appropriate to terminate Morris’ employment.
My wife had sent something that she didn’t mean.
He is not a casteist.
We are not the casteist people, "husband Joe Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children a hand that you have ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Leave it too."
Like the trial of "absorption", Plasco said that his wife had only two months of child and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you going behind someone like that?
It’s not right to do that,” the investment banker said.
While the legal lawsuit is still going on, their behavior and logic have given a quick response to their silence on social media blaming the couple’s couple on the couple’s couple’s couple.
Paddington publishers fear that the reader will not add it to their own thoughts and opinions, the new letter shows
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: “It’s hard to think of someone by replacing themselves when reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s amazing to know about the success of Pandington.”
Explaining about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameramen before writing a children’s book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about the rejection of his work, saying that both "happiness and gum" were in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, which she describes as "the important member of her family", she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
He was a quiet man and was not arrogant at all,” she said.
But because Pandington was very real to them, it was almost such that you have a child who finds something: you are proud of them, even if you are not actually doing it.
I think they’ve seen Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his imagination and creation, he always credited Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
On landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pastor 2 Hospital in Nice, where the work done by doctors was wasted.
Naed was regularly saying that it was really bad, he didn’t expect it like that,” said Mrs. Adnen-Laparus.
Then Naad called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine doctors had given to beat his heart was slowly ending up leaving his system.
She would have died a while ago and all this would have been shut down.
All I had to do was go and sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything to scream, cry, or cry, because I was surrounded by people from my family.
I had to handle everyone.”
Eventually Mrs. Adnen-Laparus who was sad at losing his daughter boarded the plane with other passengers who were unaware of what she was going through.
No one knows," he said.
I put my head down and tears flowed all the time.
It was difficult to express it, but I got to see a feeling of utmost empathy for the nad in the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women's postcards suffering to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones due to suicide want to stop others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Cali Hanfri post cards and phone numbers on Welsh bridge with inspirational messages on which people can call for assistance.
Mr. Davis’s son was 13 years old when he was suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always used to say that her smile could light up everywhere.”
Although he had left work before he died and he lived in a “very dark room.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother who at that time discovered his lost brother or sister at the age of 11, after which he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there was going to be a cumulative effect."
Ms. Davis made cards, “To let people know that there are people outside that you can go and talk to, even if he’s a friend.
Don't sit calm - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been Ms. Davis’ friend for years, lost her friend Mark of 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
He did not say anything that he was sad or upset or feeling something else," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we'll make some changes to her behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he couldn't get an eye from them."
She said her death was a major shock to her, but they had to get out of her: "It ripped the family from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight ahead.”

Kawanagua’s future was hanging in limbo when the FBI began to investigate
I thought, if I really could find something he was searching for – checking a limited time and limited scope – maybe we could bring a bit of unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, as well as fearing that the committee is “breaking down” among the alleged biased gridlocks.
Why did Mr. Kavanagua and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance was due to time.
The Madhyapada elections were only five weeks away, on 6 November - as expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so they will be seriously weakened in their efforts in what they wanted to do in the High Court on land.
George raises the phone to call the W Bush Senator, promoting him to support Mr. Kuwanagua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and meets his wife Ashli, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
There will be voting in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 democracists currently sit.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuwanagua may receive at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, the vice president, had to abolish it and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's fugitives 'fall' by Kim
The number of fugitives in North Korea decreased by seven years ago when John-Un came to power, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the Ministry of Integration of the South, Park Beyong-Syog said that 1,127 people have left their duty last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and octets were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of fugitives from the north are eventually proposed citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korea War since 1953.
The maximum China escaped, the border of which is the longest with North Korea and is easy to cross the reliably protected unificationed area (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats fugitives as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to its country by forcing them.
The relationship between North and South — which is still technically in a state of war — has seen improvements in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders from both countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, focusing on blocked nuclearization interactions.
It was activated in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim John-Un in Singapore, when they widely agreed to the conditions for working toward the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister Rei Yang-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
Without any confidence in the US, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will first have no way but to harm ourselves unilaterally” said Mr Rai in a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelori calls Brett Kavanagua "fun", he says he is not qualified for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brat Kavanagua “fun” and said that he was unfit by nature to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I can’t think that a woman can even perform such a thing, they call it “fun”, Pelosi said on Thursday, giving her feedback on the evidences of Kavanagua before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kawanagua emotionally refused allegations that he had ever sexually exploited Dr. Christine Blacie Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial statement, Kavanagua was very emotional, sometimes shouting and holding breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He apparently penalized the Democrats on the committee, who were angry with Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election, proving to him the allegations of “familiar and coordinated character secret trauma”.
Pelosi said he felt that the witnesses of Kavanagua have proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was acting against the Democrats.
I think they disqualified themselves with those statements as well as the manner in which he went to Clintonum and Democrat," she said.
Pelosi doubted that if Kavanagua becomes permanent when asked and if Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives, it would still blame Kavanagua.
I would say -- if he does not tell the truth to Congress or FBI, he is not appropriate for the Supreme Court, but he can work right now because he is invited," Pelosi said.
Kavanagua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she was worried about the potential regulations of Kavanagua against the cost-effective care of the Act or the Row V. Wade, as she is known to do conservative justice.
In the trial of his certification, Kavanagua avoided questions about if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
In the hearing of his affirmation, he avoided the questions that came to Kawangua that if he would reverse some of the Supreme Court judgments.
And women need to move it.
It is a religious convulsion, the anger of months and years comes out and she cannot stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me 45 years later that "When we cry, we get angry."
I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She continued to say, “A woman helped me a great person who worked as an officer somewhere, who said that when she gets angry too, she cries, but she has developed a new technology, which means that when she gets angry and starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
A starting job is one of my most intense memories of a male head office, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, found that an old woman caught my neck from behind - a pungent manager from which I was always a little frightened - who dragged me into the stairs.
Never cry in front of anyone" he said.
They don’t know how furious you are.
They think you’re sad and you’ll be happy to meet them.”
Patricia Schroder, a Democratic Congress woman president from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat or boat called Monkey Business by someone other than marriage and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroder, who was highly disappointed, decided to participate in the President’s race himself.
It was not a thought-out decision", she said laughing at me after 30 years.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Seven Dwarfs"."
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have the time to collect funds and so she vowed that she would not participate in the race until she had collected $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to men would only give him 250 dollars.
Did they think I got a discount?” he was surprised.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch any formal campaign, she could not overcome emotions - gratitude to those who supported her, disappointment from the system that made her difficult to collect funds and angered even disappointment and sexism from the target voters rather than delegates - she succumbed to her.
You may have thought that I will have a nervous break down" Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press might have responded to them.
You must have thought that Kleinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they will put on my tombstone?
She cried?""
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the US and China was slowing and while the war is far from expiration, the rift between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said that the first warning was made earlier this year by levying major Chinese exports taxes, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant increase in this week with new tariffs affecting items up to $200 billion (150 billion pounds) is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods that came from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time in its own way, with five to 10 percent of the most recent US goods worth 60 billion dollars slapping tariffs.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world’s second-largest economy is likely to tumble soon.
Getting back to Washington means hollowing out demands, but tilting head in front of the US in public would be very embarrassing to Zee Jingping, the President of China.
Still, experts say that Beijing could make its move, the US trade war could positively support China over the long term while reducing the inter-dependence of two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either initiate economic tailspins in the country, which is even more dangerous than actually seen before by the audience", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the center for new US security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appealed for help to rebuild a country ravaged by war more than seven years long.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly Assembly, External Affairs Minister Walid al-Moulam said that conditions are improving in the country.
The situation on land is more stable and secure because of the progress made in counter-terrorism today" he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal status.
The country now has all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it will not accept conditional aid or help from the countries sponsoring the rebellion.

It was a hard year.
So thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.

I am proud of these boys, they fought," American captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players played a great game.
We will regroup, I will work with the US PGA and Ryder Cup committee and move on with Thomas.
