Skip to the world
The market campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has made a great start and shout, and the call out in nature has started to pull people far and wide around the world.
“You own the collagen, I need Iceland,” says a woman some of the big world in comments from the YouTube marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland.
Another observer says that Iceland will preserve in its heart forever, and a young woman says it must come to Iceland as soon as her beloved living there.
However, for all misconceptions, it is in the United States, and therefore expects to have to wait for one month even further.
Another observer asks if the trail to Iceland is capable, because there are no aircraft.
Not follows the story whether he comes from another time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who came to make the advertising together with the international advertising firm M&C Saatchi, says receptiones have been hopeful.
I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been successful, but this new campaign has already started to hit a record.
Basically, this is about creating PR values, it is getting foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has been amazingly successful.
Over a relatively short period of time, we have received a review of about seven hundred medias around the world, which totals over two billion people.
The value of that review is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
It’s not amazing.”
The main market as usual is the United States and the campaign has been successful since Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egil, market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also received well, as Russia, which will be pleasantly surprising.
There has also been a response from the alien areas, such as India, which was not specifically suggested.
These advertisements have traveled beyond we expected,” says Egil, who can see more than four million people looking at the content on YouTube.
We could not have requested a better start.”
The images here at the opening took Árni Sæberg, the photographer of Morgunblaðið, on receiving advertisements that bear the title “Let It Out” in the middle of the past month.
The tanks took place wide and wide, such as the Reykjavík Skólavörðustígur in Reynisfjara, Skógafoss, on Sólheimajökull and in a cave on Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Scotland Productions, and the director of Ottar Guðnason.
The works include the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, which is from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Icelanders arrived in the making of the advertising, but at the same time there was another group in the West and the West.
According to Egil, the “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, which aims to be a winter campaign in collaboration with the M&C Saatchi.
This is just the first phase of this work for the Icelandic Association,” says Egill, adding that collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely well received.
It is great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with the knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Explosions: discuss the situation in the labour market, pension fund and much more
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will take place in Sprengisandur, which starts ten at Bylinn today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other matters.
He also discusses rural and migration of jobs out into a country that has gone ill and been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, the VR chairman, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticisms about the investment of pension funds and make ideas about the labour movement and employers withdraw from the fund’s boards to mitigate the risk of conflict of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, tourism manager in East Iceland, and Árnheisdóttir, director of the Nordic Marketing Office, will then be interviewed about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look out in the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading offer on what is to come.
Listen to the show below but it starts ten.
What she looks like today 25 years later
The actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in the junior episodes of any kind.
She was world famous for her feature as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also played in the series Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and at Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 year old, married with one child.
A little has borne her in the past, but she was able to look over the road and comment on Clues in the Australian television in the days.
She speaks beautiful about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a fantastic person.
I have to admit that I built the character mostly on girls I met in school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was.”
Do not want to leave the police station after night
About fifty cases came to the police in the metropolitan area of Reykjavík today and tells the police’s calendar that the matter was varied.
The day at the police station at Hverfisgata started by police had to have a man who had recently left a prison cell after having stayed there due to drunk driving.
The man would not go away after he was released and did not obey the police command that told him to go away.
If you win a stay at the police station due to its progression.
A man was arrested in the morning of the suspicion of burglars in his company in Kópavogur.
The police also had to interfere with two men in Breiðholt because of reports on the injuries.
A woman who sat at a central shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay for a meal after it was called police.
It was also reported to be a short drive to the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van saw her for a while, and she was then taken free hand.
The car has not been found.
Curse of the Joy - The terrible fate of the Gleestar
That theory has reached an airplane on the Internet to make a curse during the season, but the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days and thus became the third actor of the show to make life far beyond age.
The comedy series on Glee is a popular series of singing, dancing and fun.
The series discussed the so-called group of young people in high school, their love and fate.
It was not always taken out with the sweetness of being in the joyal band, but through singing and dancing, the characters seem to be able to overwhelmed every situation that came up in their lives.
But beyond the level of take-off, there has been a lot of disaster over the actors and staff of the show, so very much that theories have waked up to curse rests on the episodes.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santa Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call all his grandmother.
After the season, Rivera went to own his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and left them afterwards.
However, Dorsey refused to make a complaint, and the domestic violence case was cancelled.
On July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat on the lake Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found sleeping on a rescue vest on board the boat and was able to detect the police authorities since he and his mother had taken him for swimming and then had Rivera returned to the boat, but never returned there.
An extensive search for Rivera was established.
On the day of searching, the police officers in the area decided that the search was taken out of the fact that Rivera had been drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found to be officially declared.
It is believed that she had been involved in heavy current pressures in the lake and her latest demand for saving her son.
The cause of death was recorded with the drunk of accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith starred as Finn Hudson’s role in the show, an American soccer player with an angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the band to the road and respect.
But outside the show, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues were found enough, grab it and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then went to therapy and seemed everything to be looked at for better.
Only two months after completing the treatment, Moneith felt left in a hotel room after having gone out to have had fun with friends.
Banamine found a lethal mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that the will work was wrong.
Moneith had been treated and his endurance for drug donations had dropped so much that the dose he had previously endured well, was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death lay heavily on his colleagues, but at the end of his marriage, Lea Michele, was decided to continue and dedicate them a whole part of the memory of Monith and his character.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, as Finnish, and had a little respect for his fellow students in the band, or until he gained the courage to recognize that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of the custody of child pornography.
In his home search, a huge amount of kids porn was found, and the case soon asked out officially.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was afterwards accused and convicted of his transgression.
In addition to having to be registered for sexual offenders, he had four to seven years of prison, and he would have to seek treatment for children.
Before the judge had decided the penalty, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the show that fell from far before age.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He became prevalent in his sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was younger sister of the giant star Julia Roberts and did not have her fair story, but she accused Roberts of great politics and disrespectful appearance.
Notes took her life in 2014, but she struggled with a serious depression.
She left her letter to her beloved, where she said to her mother and sister, among other things, she was responsible for how she had come to her.
My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me unless they were as my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of applying her fellow actors bullying and laying on the hierarchy to a point and being with a verifiable astronomical cluster.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and appealed for drunk driving in 2019, which was widely shocked.
Actress Heather Morris starred in the show.
It was therefore in 2010 that the uncircumcision hackers got into nude photos of it and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her violence in the relationship.
It can be placed flowers on almost everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside the garden with the parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and thrive.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having a moment with the children in the garden is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrances, and of course the precious time they received with their parents.
Bought a boat after the tenth grade
“I don’t think there are many fishermen who work in the country’s preschools,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who performs coastal fishing during the summer, but is a psychologist at the University of Iceland during the winter.”
Beach fishing is a very pleasant summer job when you are studying.
If well fished, you can have good income and I think it is great to be able to release a student loan.
The income also attracted me well in the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist student, who has been involved in coastal fishing this summer as in the last summer.
Axel was the most recent thing to dock in Tálknafjörður when the journalist spoke from him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”
The winter I was in the tenth grade I took board rights for boats that are under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished the primary school.
I have been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintances, Hartmann Jónsson, and I made the boat name of his name.
Hartmann was grown when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very satisfied when he saw his boat carrying his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” says Axel, adding that he bought the boat in three million.
I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, but the other half at the end of the summer when I had already fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of this first summer.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out on a boat when he had just finished school?
“I had been laying for and collecting myself money, I had been working with dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my thing.
I also put my confirmation money into my boat fund.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, from where all his mother is, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the west because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied in this area west of rowing with my dad.
I move between the fjords depending on how I feel, because this area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I find it best to stay in the west, I have also provided around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and beyond.
I’ve also been giving south, but it’s the main lump of Grey,” says Axel, who always strips one fire early in the morning, saying sometimes talking with the pennies and singing for the sky, for some time together on the outside of the ball ocean.
"The internet connection on the ocean is good, so I can call, listen to podcast shows and music.
I don’t like being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into the dangers, but certainly has been something for the weather, but never a lot of danger,” says Axel, who is lucky with that he is never a seagull.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is doing at any given time.
In the coastal fishing industry I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but I’ve been continuously in one and a half hour out to catch fishing.”
The arrangement in the coastal fishing sector he says that it can catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds inhibiting.
‘Other restrictions are they that I must not catch Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and I can only catch twelve days of month, this four months that are fishing for sea fishing, May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their own fishing days after the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary press is supposed to be rowed instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and can choose after their own head.
I could also go by and sea, which are well located by the fishing grounds should enjoy it,” says Axel, who extracts most of the cod from the salt sea on their shores, but also has a doubt and unique other types of float with.
Axel works during winter with the University of Iceland at Núpur in Kópavogur.
“I don’t think there are many sailors working in preschools in the country,” says Axel Relief, adding that he has only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.
I therefore get stuck because I feel this awesome job.
I hope that my degree of psychology will be useful in the future of preschools,” says Axel, who is also a long way of studying business.
Villa in registration was prevented from a homage
A villa in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country made a person, living in Iceland, was not called back in sampling.
It is not a requirement to register the ID number if the person fills the form in English, as this is done in Icelandic.
This will be looked at this week,” said a specialist in the field of occupational health and safety.
Three domestic diseases were detected at the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who turned out positive came to Iceland on 15 July, two days after the rules for such a homestay plan entered into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then temporarily disembarked at arrival in Iceland and returned to sample four to five days later.
It was stated in the Lunch news that the person in question had followed the old system.
The shortening of the border was negative and he was not called back in screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, specialist in the field of quarantine of land doctor, says in a conversation with a news agency that this can be attributed to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, they are not required to enter their ID number as is in the Icelandic version.
After that, it was mostly thought of foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not received an automatic invitation to put in the sampling.
However, Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on the World Entrepreneurship Portal even though they have filled the registration form in English and in some cases, employers have also been alerted to sending people in sampling again after they arrived in Iceland.
This will be looked at during the week how to make it easier for people to draw their attention to the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go in sampling, but two were beginning to show symptoms.
The infection is now underway with the three infections that were detected yesterday, but it is mostly completed due to the two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, reciprocal analysis of Icelandic genetic analyses has revealed that there is a variation of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have been directed towards Israel, although it is known that the virus who had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says it would be possible to lie before tomorrow where the other virus was coming.
In total, there are now 15 in isolation according to the COVID. is.
135 are quarantined.
Four of the five infected unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in the past few days.
Of them, four are completely unrelated and, for example, it is not possible to find the origins of the infection that occurred on the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday.
The infection is still ongoing.
Originally in quarantine, the number of visitors in the 16th century was slightly fewer.
Overall, 34 in quarantine due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time at a short time that infection is diagnosed during sports events, and it has raised questions about whether such events are holding.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager at the Department of Civil Protection, says it quite slowly, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
We are constantly urgent for all those here who have to keep up individual infection prevention measures.
We also need to urgent for people who are hosting events that there are certain rules going on that need to go after.
Then you can hold an event,” John said.
He says that you can prevent infection by holding on the air of individual infection prevention measures.
Furthermore, rules and guidelines are constantly reviewed.
“What needs to be done, and what the Civil Protection Department and the Directorate of Health are constantly urgent for people, is to consider these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and also with service companies.
That people wash for hands and use sprints.
It prevents infection from going on,” says John.
We need to push for people to continue on the good journey we are on, so that we can keep up the progress we have so far.”
40% victim COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father was with diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infections.
diabetes was specified as the underlying problem and Brumfield, which also has diabetes, is afraid of the fact that only one should go for themselves.
Reuters news provider says fear Brumfield is not reasonless.
The figures of a new study carried out by the U.S. authorities show that nearly 40% of those who have had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is checked, the proportion will rise in half.
The investigation by the U.S. infection control (CDC) took more than 10,000 people in 15 countries suffering from the coronavirus period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in Infectious disease at CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who are diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuters’ slow growth led to a survey and point out the answers from the 12 countries who responded to comparable proportions.
10 states, but among them are California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet reported underlying diseases.
“Sugar cloud was already epidemic in slow growth.
Now, COVID—19 has violated as a powerful age,” Reuters by Elbert Huang, Executive Director of the Centre for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the Chicago University.
Sugaritis is more common among the black and people of South American origin, which has also gone worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best defenses for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease through fitness, healthy diet and healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus has made it difficult for many weeks to keep the routine.
Furthermore, high prices on insulin consumed some to continue attending work and risking being exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that the U.S. authorities have been aware of the risks they have with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them were with the disease and in the swine fluencies in 2009, this group was at a higher risk of having to enter the hospital.
When MEERS reported in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were put into intensive care were with diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a senior scientist at Yale University, says that because the impact of the COVID-19 virus could take longer to deprive the veil from a number of previously unknown complications.
“I fear that we will see a wave of problems when finished,” says Andrew Bolton Chairman of the International Association of Sugar Diseases.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney diseases and kidney separation.
As well as new studies, the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says researchers are trying to understand the relationship between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus depends on the heart, lungs and kidneys, the organs already sick for many who have diabetes.
Furthermore, the high percentage of glucos and lipids of sugar can produce a truly “ cellboard storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and depends on the body.
Damaged inclination cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can cause deadly blood clots.
“This is all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
It’s all intertwined.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were invited champagne, so they left the room.”
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollison were interviewed by artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera set up in Paris.
We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.”
Atli Bollison never forgets when he met his wife and child mother, Asrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
I was very fascinated by her.
It was natural just the emission, but it also seemed to me completely unreasonable.
And yet again,” he said.
Asrún recalls the first meeting regularly.
I’m always hearing this story.
Last weekend,” she who also attracted her husband to the first sex.
I felt and felt so much suede around Atli, whom I elephant.
There’s a lot going on and much to happen, and I’m fascinated by it.”
Atli says they have focused on their relationship to go their own ways.
We do not bind our bag to the same knots as our fellow travellers.
We avoid buses that we observe around us.”
It is possible the reason they took the talk from Ragnar Kjartansson, an artist just celebrating, although it would be most unusual.
“Kritín Anna our shared friend contact us and asks if we can come to eat desert with him, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar’s wife on Snaps.”
They were invited, met the trilogy of Snaps, and had a desert wine and each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at an art exhibition that he thought to be set up in Paris’ Palais de Tokyo in the autumn.
He had multi-channel video works called Scenes from the western culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Asrún said he described the work as a banana and dekadent scenes from the everyday life of the West.
He had sketches of all the scenes he meant to shoot, and last told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining.”
Senan whom Ragnar asked the couple to join the direction to show a young middle class pair to love in a minimalist room.
These are intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much though they had known him and he of them “but they knew us and felt fit in this.
They had a word that they did not want to advertise to people.
Maybe they did not believe that they would not get the right people, but people who had sexually dispelled themselves from being a soldier for others.”
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to think the matter, but it did not take a long time.
“When we had passed on by Snaps, we said: ‘Are we not just this?
This was just that way.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,” says Asrún and Atli.
It’s about love and closeness”
Senan was picked up in an exclusive apartment on the Mýrar Street.
There was a very poor film team; the director, Ragnar and the soundman, and the couple.
After turning on the recording, all the room was left to wait in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
“We hadn’t decided anything how we should be.
We got some little instructions, but we tried to forget a moment and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no play, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asrún.
But was this romantic?
Yes, it was a little romantic,” says Atli and Ásrún.
We were offered champagne before they went out of the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a fine hotel in Paris.”
The team was delighted with the performance of the pair in the work that moved with them.
When Tommi decides, he wept, and he thought it so nice,” says Atli.
It’s as much about love and closeness as it’s in place as possible,” says Ásrún.
Atli said that his mother heard the voice in the son at Reykjavík Art Museum and realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turned around and starts to plunder in this way,” says Atli.
Mom and dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that way, but so just my dad sends me a message and says: Fun to come across a small family in Palais de Tokyo.”
And if you intend to participate in the work, have deepened the relationship between Asrún and Atli?
We are still together, so maybe this would deepen up something.
This entirely deepened my relationship with the family of connected,” says Asrún, laughs.
Asrún’s work was done in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I felt a little hard not to be with you but someone else,” she says, turning around to her husband.
“But it was nice to see that this is just one scene in a much bigger piece and when one saw this with the other works, this is very cool.
I could a little bit break away from it and was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach,” says Asrún, who was pregnant with another child of the couple when the tea was taken up.
It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marisbil Clausen interviewed Asrún and Atli in Love Stories on Channel 1.

Swansea leads it 1–0 in the duel, but the second game takes place on the next Wednesday at the home of Brentford.
Fifty years from 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American Ambassador in Iceland, is in the light of the press after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed guard where he feared his life.
However, it has not been unreasonable for the President of the United States to appoint ambassadors here in Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst's office, the U.S. representative at the end of April 2009 has been totally ambassadorless in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned according to the strange situation, but Kastljós reported that she should have obtained the Falcon word.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the office that she would not be honoured.
After she disappeared from Iceland she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the successor of Van Voorst came to work, in September 2010.
It can be traced to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as a Ambassador but did so.
At the time, Louis Ariega had then worked in the foreign service for decades.
In the autumn of 2013 he resigned to the office of a Ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another Ambassador-free period took over.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States in January 2015 and came to work shortly later, but no Ambassador had been on site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed but not a diploma, but he had worked as a lawyer and a short election fund for Baracks Obama.
He left positions as soon as Donald Trump took over the presidential office on 20 January 2017, as is usual with a political ambassador.
Trump’s board was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and high-end officers in the Washington government system.
Therefore, two years until the United States Congress announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter his meeting to ask him the spies out and confirm the end that the Ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony to the Thing he never said he had come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been out of Dutch crime.
Gunter is politically appointed, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in Jewish organizations in the Republic of Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner, Sheldon Adelson, established them as an organization, while Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no Ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest one in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump’s board was to appoint people in a key office as well as in recent years, the work of the United States Congress has greatly decreased in the longing, including confirming the Ambassador in office.
Since 2009, there has been an unrest in Iceland for over five years.
However, it hasn’t been prevented from construction on behalf of the embassy that just opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
Construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion but the safety wall is surrounded by the building and amplified glass is in all windows.
However, it doesn’t seem enough to fill the current ambassador safetyal because he is said to fear about his life and has asked to get a armed guard.
The former player ÍBV had an ass in Iceland - “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tony Mawejje, a former member of ÍBV, claims to have been hurt when he was in Iceland and that he regrets having come to Iceland.
This occurs in an interview with Tony, who appeared on the Ugandan medium Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a game in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tony talks about many things, including his time in Iceland, but he played with ÍBV, Val og Grótti in Iceland.
When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play at the middle as I used to play.
The team’s captain was in that position, but he also included the shirt number I wanted so I didn’t get either of what I wanted,” says Tony, who played at the right edge of the season with ÍBV.
Among the things that Tony discussed is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players are exposed to when playing in Europe.
It came once for me, but as I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I learned from the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He told me that my opponent had had rash comment about me after I had brought him.”
In 2014, Tony went to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistake that he sees the most.
Tony hadn’t managed to get to the start team at Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked him to return to Iceland on his loan, but he went to Val's aid.
It was a mistake to come to Iceland again on a loan.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted,” says Tony, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he could probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made out of his dreams of getting into a large group in Europe.
Find Worms in throat woman
Doctors at the St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 cm long black worm in a suited woman who searched there.
Doctor managed to pull the worm out with a tongs.
A study revealed that parasites were being parasites.
CNN explains from this.
The woman had a few days before eating sashimi, which are thin slices of meat.
The woman quickly improved after the worm was removed but parasites like these are often in raw meat or fish.
After the sushi raided in the West, the situation in which parasites have been received in people is increased, CNN reported.
Fear that other waves are starting in Europe
Spain is now underway with concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to initiate the spread of the coronavirus pandemic again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona infectious times.
Other European countries have also taken measures due to the increase in infection in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to quarantine with the return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned of travel to Spain.
Stakeholders are also increasing the number of new ones in France and Germany, where the government try to find a balance to bolster the spread of the virus and bring the economy back.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but the global infectious rate is 300 thousand per day, which includes the most infection in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has reached 16 million worldwide, according to John Hopkins University count, and death is confirmed to be related to the virus at 644 thousand.
Mosaic Works Made gets finally enjoying her full time
In front of the Tollhúsið in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it, humans have orange helmets.
There is also a large digging.
And more smaller machinery.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the sidewalk is moved, and many people are now standing by, respecting the artwork from millions of mosaic tiles — just as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it did not respect.
The work has been fairly hidden so far, right in front of it there were parking spaces that were always overestimated.
People put there, locked the car in a sharpest and then jumped off to their business in the city center.
The “bio and diverse public spaces” and “impressive urban areas” are the guiding light of the reconstruction of Tryggvagata, which is now above.
The goal is to celebrate the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerður Helgadóttir in Tollhúsið to enjoy a better view.
In front of the piece will be a square and since the area is well located by the sun it is considered suitable for road users.
The artwork will be lit up and now gets the material wood to enjoy it better than before in this 142 square flat.
There will also be small ‘mist sprays’, a number of water sculptures, which offer a game and provide the area with a certain mystery.
In this way, improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík which is under construction along with Veitur.
Pipes of water supply, heating utilities and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their years, but the sewage pipes and cold water pipes are from 1925 and have served residents and companies in the city centre for almost a century.
When the street is opened again after construction, cars can re-create it.
But it will become a monopoly street and at the same time creates a calm and accessible space for pedestrians.
In information about the Directorate of Customs website, it is stated that the building was in use in 1971 and that its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because port damage reached through the building formed there a 250 square meter windowless wall surface out to the street.
The construction committee and architects agreed that such a plane would have a bad impact on the overall street image, if there were no special measures to match the appearance of the building.
Therefore, the parties agreed to calculate by installing a permanent work of art there.
During this time a mickle word of Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, was told in the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaics in Germany and beyond.
It was first seized to contact her before it was decided whether there would be competition for the work.
It had often been said that the work had to mirror life by the harbour, as the harbor had been life for Reykjavík since it was done.
When talking to the artist, she had to tell the idea of such a work.
An agreement was reached that she received drawings and other assistance before returning from the country, where she would work with the proposals abroad.
At the time she decided herself to have, and when she returned home she submitted some suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
An agreement was also requested to enter into an agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, who had worked with them for a long time on the installation of famous works across Europe.
The contract was completed and the work was carried out by the artist in the workshop, which then carried out in the Directorate of Customs.
All the work was exceptionally well resolved, both by Gerðar Helgadóttir and Oidtmann’s brothers, in the summary.
This has since been a bad weather in Iceland.
Made about two years working the work, which was done and set up between 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the work of Tollhús was completed, only 47 years old.
Prepares transfers of more institutions to the country
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be transferred to Iceland in the near term.
This told the minister in the show Sprengisandur at Wave for lunch.
Recently it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
There are six specialists in the fields of fireworks, but none of them intends to accompany the institute north and has the national association of fire and medical transport officials criticized the migration.
I think we should step further in this being.
I am preparing further steps in this being.
Further transportation,” said Ásmundur.
He commented that the vast majority of the nation wants to see the greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it has to make more political decisions about the transport of public jobs in the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority,” said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to Iceland and made important for rural communities such as the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority’s transport to Selfoss, the survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance on Skagaströnd.
All the main since the second day of the Champions tournament
Iceland's 94th Master's tournament in free sports ended at Thorsvoll in Akureyri today.
Several tournaments were set on the second day of the race.
An exciting competition for women was calculated at Thórsvellir, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH settled settled Íslandsmet in the sledgest in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR was added in May last year.
Vigdis won the Icelandic record this summer and has been in a fashion form recently, but she has tripled the Icelandic record of the summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not pick up today.
She only had one valid throw of five, cast 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdis cast the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and eventually set a protest.
Her Icelandic record was 62,69 metres from the beginning of July, although it was somewhat from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsson from ÍR had the second best throw of the day and she added her best results with a chest of 50.18 m.
The men’s class won the FH-hangur Hilmar Örn Jónsson, the Icelandic record holder in percussion, a safe victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his second cast and set a record.
His record in the industry is 75.26 metres.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, a Olympiar and the Icelandic Met Office at Thorsvoll yesterday, who competed in the roundst that is his main branch.
Godna Vals’s record is 65,53 metres, which was the longest casting of 59.13 metres today, guaranteed.
Valdimar Hjalta Erlendsson, one of the most important casts in the 2nd place, 49.43 metres.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, the Icelandic record holder, won a long jump with a total of 6.25 meters today, almost 40 cm of the Icelandic record.
In the 200-metre-run run of women, the Icelandic Women’s Irish-owned Guðbjörg Jónas Bjarnadóttir was born in 24.04 seconds, with a record of 23,45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was a winner of two gold medals in Akureyri, a 100 m race and a 4 x 100 m race.
In the men's category Kolbeinn Hörður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to finish the 200 m run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Ólafur Mána Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Jóna Guðbjörg, Kolbeinn won gold in 100 metres yesterday as well as at the 400-metre run.
Not receiving a fine for 27 million Bitcoin harvesting
The Internal Revenue Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigation manager who required a fine for defrauding their capital income due to the sale of Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.
The Committee found that the tax research director had not provided clear arguments for why it would be necessary to impose a fine on man.
The Board of Appeals states that the Directorate of Internal Revenue considered the person to have recognised materially incorrect tax returns for the income year 2016 and 2017.
He had underestimated his capital income generated due to the sale of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or of spectacular destabilization.
The guilty beareth man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the Committee.
However, he worked on having sold Cryptocurrency in 2016 for 27 million.
He would have had a dignified year in 2009 and 2010 when both such had been easy and unexplored with an ordinary home computer.
Then he pointed out that, when selling the cryptocurrency, tax implementation due to such sales would have been significantly unclear and unforeseeable.
It would have been possible to expect public sector bodies to report on such measures on the tax return.
He hadn’t intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest, and had reported his property on the return as a currency account balance.
He had inquired with both the knowers and the Directorate of Internal Revenue about how this was pronounced but without success.
He then thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland, and had only lived here for several years when he began digging after Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarize themselves with the complex rules that the tax authorities had not formed a clear view.
So the man thought it was right that his taxes for these two income-adjusted years would be reconsidered and stressed, but in other respects they did not make punishment.
He then repeated his presence in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He would never have intended to get away from his duties in a disobedient manner.
The claim for a fine would be out of all moderation and would cast it into debts.
Brynjolf wakes up a talk: “This man understands what football is doing”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been very different from the teeth of people, but also attracted the rehearsal of his efforts that are of play with Breiðabilk in the Pepsi Max league.
Blinds will be in the fire line tonight when they receive the ÍA live broadcast on the Station 2 Sport.
Brynjolf then takes out a play ban on four reminders during the season, so no new haircuts like in summer games so far.
He had written "bla, blah" on his head for the game by HK on Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was answering with the payment, but speaking about character, this was better to try in the game.
He did not go in hides.
He wants the ball every single time, and if there was someone going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or create it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max Girl, when it was thought to Brynjolf.
“I should be here for the people.”
It’s hard sometimes realizing what it’s in.
He looks for a bit on the left when it starts to feel the games, but he has a very free roll in the team,” Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjolf real entertained and delights in getting such a colorful man in the league: “There is no one who shares that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love it with your hair, and always be ready to meet and answer in interviews.
It’s an amazing amount of people busy with him, which tells me that this man understands what football is.
‘I am a entertainer.
I’m going to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
The people are reading the interview with Brynjólfur, people are paying themselves in and keeping an eye on what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,” said Máni.
The player KR says that he wants to leave the company - “I have been in touch with some teams in the B league”
Tobias Thomsen, a player at the Pepsi Max league, appears to be on the go from the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the period in his home country, but he first needs to resign his contract with KR, where the Danish Department starts before that Icelandic probability.
The company know I miss Denmark and have shown me a lot of understanding,” said Tobias Bold.
I’ve been in touch with several teams in the B division and will probably switch before the Icelandic period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can allow themselves to pay up my agreement with KR.”
Then he said that he must most likely take on a wage cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have likely found more for the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Wheel rest Brightmar has recovered reels for millions - now responds to itself depending on the coverage of DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had interests unlike most of the others.
It needs up and rescues lost and stolen bikes, electric bikes and scooters.
He has earned the name ‘wheel rest’ as a result.
Yesterday, a lot of feathers came up when you published a story from their dealings with Bjartmar.
In this talk, DV referred to the Facebook group of the West, stating that Bjartmar has taken the man to speech at Austurvöllur and told the scooter possible to be stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electromotive person, but that Bjartar had given him theft.
The text has now been changed to Facebook and the headlines of the initial DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case at all is not a descriptive for what really went on yesterday at Austurvöllur.
It was said that Bjartmar had received information from the victim’s electric shuttles that this was truly electric.
This information was collected by the owner, but the information was found wrong, says Bjartmar.
I saw the guy and I looked at the shuttle, as there was information about an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time.
I certainly hesitated, but when I saw him prepare to drive off the shuttle, I decided to knock on talking with the man.
The owner was sure in his case and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I go very fine in such a matter, but before I managed to finish what I had to tell the man had taken from me.”
Bjartar says that the man on the raft had invited him to show his receipt for the wheel and that he himself was called to the police.
“Yes, cool,” he said, “get it just clean.”
Then the owner of the electric shuttle confirmed ownership of its electric shuttle and went on.
Later, the rights owner of the electric shuttle were reported on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
During this bed that Bjartmar has practiced this practice, he says that the exchange he could pick up with people on the fingers of one hand.
“I’ve been communicating with the most extreme people in Reykjavík,” he said, “I’ve had a happy relationship with Reykjavík’s most extreme people,” and he pointed out that there are often the smallest brothers and sisters in society, figuring, psychiatricised people and other people who are affected by the road.
“The addiction is a hard master and somehow needs to be financed to the next dose, unfortunately theft of such a liquidity is easy to the goal,” says Bjartmar.
My communication with these people is really so good that I have a lot of the good people with me.
There are examples of people taking therapy and looking for me to help me with what I’m doing,” he said.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is in a courteous note.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and offers peacefully to show him receipts, the number of bikes and so on.
The cycleft is a big problem that has been covered by little.
Furthermore, Bjartar says that the police even suggest people to talk to him out of stolen bikes.
Bjartmar is unhappy with the previous newspaper transfer of DV and claims to not be a type of self-organized police in a personal search for the justice.
When asked if he is not on the high ice, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, he says.
Of course, the law should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the law is not necessarily performing this.
For example, I have watched the policemen drive away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
It’s pure out of this matter.”
“When the law is not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this matter, why not?” asks Brightmar.
He says that he has achieved so much success in having on his stolen wheels, sometimes he encountered his “clients” on the street that they just had the right brighter wheel that they had previously attained.
The exchange that Bjartar has called for the assistance of the police has established that she doesn’t show up.
“This is not just working with the police, and it is not me to blame, and it is not the owners of the bicycles to blame,” he said, commenting that the victims of the telephony have to suffer the tomuse of police in this case.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
Many stories can be found by people thanks to Brighter for having achieved their belongings back to them.
It is said that Bjartmar has long been losing the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts run for millions, if not millions.
Road there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric vehicles heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar is working on a day to kindergarten and every other weekend he works on his farm.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he attends during his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a major anniversary in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
In 1919, the government had received retirement from the Danish king, but the pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
The foundation for current pension funds for the general wage earners was then awarded with universal collective agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for a work-related pension fund with a mandatory membership and a full-fledged fund since the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, the legislation on the basis of these agreements was established, and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.
The pension scheme of employees was not the only radical change that the trade union movement of the 20th century ran through its struggles.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in historical strike actions in 1955, and the organization also obtained progressively on its claims for illness rights and sickness funds, significant holiday rights, shortening the working time, housing benefit, and more as much exchanged.
All these rights cost a great deal and a strict struggle, but tried to consider, much more and more lasting wage benefit than the increase in the aur in the pay gap, which disappeared from the heat of inflation that characterized the period after the war to 1990s as many remember.
The decline in the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
While it was eventually agreed that the funds would be in fact the fund member’s property, the trade union movement became involved that their board should appoint representatives of employees and fund members to equal pay.
In the coming years, the demand for the majority of the fund’s employees was often discussed in the employee’s association, but it never managed to go ahead, so we still sit up with the unusual mechanisms that fund members are not in the majority of the funds’ board.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on Guarantee of Pension Rights and the activities of pension funds are covered by the Fund’s investment policy.
It states that “the pension fund shall be guided by the interests of the fund members.”
5th, it is said: “The pension fund shall establish ethical criteria for investments.”
The Pension Fund’s share policy includes the following provisions of the aforementioned provisions:
The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investment, as well as many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the Western Sea and Europe.
The rules focus on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can help improve the investment performance of securities portfolio.
Thus, the interests of investors and the goals of society come together in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, set a public policy on: to maintain good corporate governance of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Values, which has the largest funds in the country, have set itself a 'details of Responsible Investment' and which are the provisions of a similar nature.
This is all reminiscent of the latest fashion words in Iceland, ‘s shadow management’.
As the case is new, it is not hoped that it has been defined as being “most taken”: The shadow management is already a member of the union states that he intends to send the members of the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to make a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be withdrawn from the Board in the first practicality.
If the leader does not have this in the media and does not speak about terminations, however, that is not "shadow management" as this is the case between people, of course, always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about who the way he finds a ‘s more shady.”
There are in particular two people who have tried to shape this definition when written, in the morning of the Saturday 25 July 2020.
There are Hord Ægisson journalist on the newspaper and Ásgeir Jónsson Governor.
The occasion with each other was after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced that the agreement between the airline and airfares had been terminated by the airline and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce Association, sent them recommendations to the Board of Pension Funds to support the possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they may be deviated.
A little later, Bogi Nils drew his decision back, and later, Ragnar Þór went with his recommendation, of course, on the decision of Bogi.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the newspaper Friday of the Newsblaðið, with big words about shadow management, law enforcement and a strong need for changes in legislation.
There you certainly have a little bit to wonder about a heavy load, although blessed you would have been in touch and in addition been dried out snacking.
Since the issue is important, let's mind the content yourself at the end.
I worked here ahead of the rules on pension funds related to this matter.
The board of directors is required to safeguard the interests of the fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are further implemented in the Articles of Association, both as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT only look to the short-term profitability factors in their investments.
This would be a major policy and it is not necessary to look for examples of such in the past, as large banks and funds have flowed to the immoral adventure and environmental wasted, with catastrophic consequences.
Icelandair’s CEO obviously was on the high ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus reducing the power that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw himself and drew this back.
The time points out whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be responsible for the fund members at the time of the project.

One of the infectious things did not apply to world estimation
One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to Iceland from the Baltic states on 15 July, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Icelander who is not living here, and therefore did not get clear instructions on having such a homestay after coming to Iceland and going for other samples a few days after arrival.
He got negative from screening to borders.
But he is in Icelandic society and in fact to go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of infection prevention at Landlækur and a paradoxical school during his summer, in an interview with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and it is not mandatory to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered, you are not automatically called in the second sample.”
She says that he has been able to use the English registration form because he is actually residing abroad but because of his network in Iceland he would have rather been using it Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
When the ID No. is not recorded, you will need to follow it yourself to come to the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way,” says Kamilla.
As such, it is clear that we need to strengthen the disclosure of this while we find any way to automate the preaching system even though Icelanders do not register their IDs.
Or then to do it somehow evident who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, though, the person concerned will get to Iceland even though he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, the protection of Icelanders.
Only six people have been sent to quarantine after they were diagnosed yesterday, and these six were all in association with him.
They’re going to be in sampling, but two of them are still beginning to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received negative from his sampling to the border on July 15th.
Kamilla probably says he had recently been infected by the virus that it has not yet been detected when the sample was taken over the borders.
However, she does not want to rule out that man was infected in Iceland but did not carry the virus with her to the country.
It is not quite possible to claim that this is safely imported infectious because it is far since he came to Iceland that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little strength in relation to the sport.”
That is, however, she says that it is very unlikely because of the fact that the few man is concerned here.
“It is really very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but it is not possible to exclude it until Icelandic genetic analysis has been ordered to identify the virus in man.
If we receive a virus plug that has not been seen here before, it is almost safe that it has applied to the country.”
Pepper spray and bombs applied to protesters
There was a conflict between police and protesters in Seattle this night.
Police applied protests pepper spray and unexpected hand bombs, but protests broke windows and turned on.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested widely in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were supported by protests in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas state was one protesting shot to death.
As the BBC takes place, the aggressor has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of peaceful protests gathered.
A group of people then turned into a construction site and broke the windows in the City’s courthouse.
Following that, the police told the protests to be unfavoured and conflicts between the groups of protesters and the police.
Requires justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police in August last year, recalled by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of people of state leaders came together and required justice for Brenni Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was killed by police in her home in March.
The group carried firearms and walked in states at the controversial intersection where the police separated the group from a group of people who objected to protests and also carried firearms.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was killed by a white barowner in May.
Solscrapers: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjar, Manchester United Football Manager, does not want to make too much of the game's importance to Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against Wolves, the end of Solskjar and his men in the 5th place and thus lose a league seat.
However, they should still be expecting to get to the Champions League by winning the European League next month.
We have not arrived at the end station.
If we reach a level against Leicester, I think people will say that we have not had a bad period now,” Solskjær said.
But whatever happens is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot of land to reach the two teams above us,” Solskjær said.
It is clear that the nerves of men will be there at 15 today, but Solskjar tried to make as if each other game was about.
If one wants to belong to Manchester United, one must be used to be under the press in the final game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is based on the company.
We’ve created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s our way of utilizing it,” Solskjær said.
"This is not the most important game of the period, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our season, we have already had many times to define this season.”
“Come Bruno Fernandes has changed a lot for us and I believe that we are in a better form and will be stronger mentally than in the last period,” Solskjær said.
65,000 infections during the day
65,490 new infection rates were detected in the United States yesterday at John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178021 infections have been confirmed by the western seas from the beginning of the pandemic there in Iceland.
900 died because of the virus yesterday but for the last four days until the death of the virus was more than 1,000 in a day.
A total of 146,460 deaths for the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the US government’s forecast, the number of deaths caused by the virus is 175,000 August.
Fear of the second wave wave
The Government of Spain is now seeking out weak might hold the rise in the spread of COVID—19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new COVID-19 cases, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been more detected in one day since the beginning of May, and the news is coming from Spain and Spain is starting to lift one of the most stringent European exit bans.
The backstage resulted in the obligation of the British authorities to quarantine upon arrival by passengers arriving from Spain.
A week before, Spain was on the UK’s list of safe states.
The situation is the worst thing in Catalonia in the northeastern part of Spain, where the government has taken more measures to try to tame the rate.
In Barcelona’s capital area, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and elders will close at midnight.
The ban is now valid for 200 thousand residents in western Catalonia.
The decision of the British is expected to have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which will depend on the arrival of foreign tourists and the bad game after the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
The authorities around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of pandemic, but little interest seems to be on taking back to a large extent a prey ban, which has laid the economy down.
For example, Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken very ill in such a way as the nuclear weapon he does not want to use.
Jean Castex, French Prime Minister, said that the nation “ would not get a life of, economic or social,” if it were again taken to a national court ban.
Apparently, many local authorities resorted to residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be able to hold back the virus on the next traffic in case of it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic treats were detected yesterday, in addition to the border.
In this way, five individuals were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infections yesterday in Iceland.
In a public announcement, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent into isolation and sixteen in close association with him in quarantine.
This was a participant in the sports club’s social activities in Reykjavík and is according to the report, “only part of the sport team” in quarantine.
Others who were sent in quarantine relate to man in another way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded, and the infection is in full swing by the National Commissioner’s infection control team.
The organisers of the CUP have adhered to the instructions and regulations of the Chief Epidemiologist and the public protection that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, images of the tournament showed some attention in a very close association to celebrate the good progress of his team on the field.
Just before 11:00 today, the organisers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It states: "The parents will respect the rules that the participants apply for themselves to school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was detected yesterday but is associated with the infection reported on the previous day.
The report states: “Icelandic genetic analysis has analyzed the infection and has found a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
It is also being processed in the case of infection and is infected in isolation and 12 quarantine due to infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
It was detected on the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six in close association with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already starting to show the symptoms of viral infection.
In addition, two at the border were detected and the result is requested as further research as per the orbit of border matters.
Finally, the report states: The Directorate of Civil Protection and Directorate of Health is urgent for people to take care of their care and to pay good attention to individual infection prevention measures.
The games mentioned doubt whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are there, the same is asked to take sampling at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the campsite booked about shopping weekend - direct guests another
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to the announcement from the West Fjords.
Guests are advised to check out other options.
Names Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes in Redsandur, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
It is enough to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as the previous year Skjaldborg festival, the Icelandic documentary will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in the town.
If the weather doesn’t put a bar in an account, but DV said earlier today from a derivative forecast, one can expect a good attendance this year.
However, the weather can be expected on the south side, and the hope of Patreksfjörður is.
The website bb.is first told us that all other accommodations in the town were already booked.
A whole apartment building grooves down to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18–20.
During the third year, owners seeking renovations, but their queries have been successful in the system.
One of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts in the City of Reykjavík is a large apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house there are two staircases, each of which has four pretty large apartments.
Are they ranging from 93 to 130 square meters, although most of the 100.
The house has a lot of history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, hosted video rentals, the shoe shop, the dairy dairy dairy dairy farm Jóa gunsmith, fish sales, and now the University print.
The house has, so mild to speak, its luxury idiots will be more beautiful.
The house is now under much damage, as you can see in the attached pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are in accordance with the corporate registry of other Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús went for the owners group of Borgun and was the director of the holding company.
In a group of owners of the holding company Borgun, Steelskip is ehf.
Steel ship is an investment company Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gudrun is also the owner of a third of the shares in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once drove a ship Steel vessels.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore not been maintained since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated continuously since, although most in recent years.
On the Facebook page of the residents in the neighborhood says one of the residents “has not been very lively for the past few years”.
There may be play in that owners have for a few years been posted by changing the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house for a long time has not been okay.
It’s long time to do something proper to this spot and boring that this has been done like that.”
Furthermore, he says that he’s filled out with the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, finding someone a common flat with the neighbors of the house and canceling this ‘lawship’.
Do this just in consultation with the surrounding community so you can drive in this and finish it.”
The “Law App” as a resident refers to is the organization of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 after their permission to build a floor on the current apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an annex to one floor as well as a basement.
The granting of the building permit was appealed to the Environmental and Natural Resources Committee, and the Committee repealed it not a support in the dispute structure and the reporting was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík then went on with crucible work and completed it with an advertisement in the Official Journal of July last year.
It was also appealed to the committee and repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, nearly three years from the initial application for building permit and the owners of the building were in the starting field.
The house had at this time dragged down considerably, and neighbors began to get tired.
When DV asked neighbors the house out into the situation and the reactions of the neighbors were the answers in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the house’s intentions, others not at all.
Others beckoned to the city, others not.
Others were just angry but nothing necessarily out in anyone.
Still others said the parking necessitation, but the neighbors have used the unused parking Dunhaga 18–20 under their vehicle.
One complainant in the case said long-term fatigue in the administration:
“Let’s have to go through the process for a moment is absolutely amazing.
It’s like the City of Reykjavík couldn’t read.”
Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.
Monument to the maritime administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of their work that is currently on the starting point.
When a journalist was sitting at Dunhagi 18, a park with a windowed door and a rubbish.
The Playstation computer and a recent television lay around the rest of the earth — victims of Icelandic summer soaking.
Open into the University Centre’s old office, and there a lot of cats from the artisanal to judge.
It is clear that someone has nested around in one corner but no one can see.
Characters of sofas and beds and several pallets of geological pages, which undoubtedly you should become a book, flash around.
The house’s staircases were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was fortunate enough to collide with the inhabitants of one of them.
The Romania had to boil themselves potato dishes for dinner and invite the journalist to the inside.
The cubicles work for the employees’ rental Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time, claiming DV that the company has nothing paid for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not pre-conditional to collect rent.
Of the circumstances of post in the house lobby, it is clear that there have been some number of foreign workers living in the last few months.
The construction of a temporary-work agency has not been spared by the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two burners have been the most efficient use of the service of the temporary rent.
However, households at Dunhaga 18 seem to have enough time to do and so, as the plants and mittens in their common areas have long working days in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the early condition of the house, the apartment that the boys were well maintained.
When the journalist claimed the boys Romanian, he suddenly became clear: at the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of property is downright.
Owners want to change the house to improve and neighbors will improve the situation but share the definition of ‘Recovered’.
Between them the city’s urban planning area is on the starting point, endless appeals and appeal options are available in the planning process and subsequently the disputed resolution of the Decision committee on environmental and resource issues.
In the house, such Romanian workers, maybe exactly those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop commuting.
The article was originally published in the weekend magazine DV 17 July.
In a fight against obesity following the coronavirus pandemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in a campaign against obesity, which will, among other things, involve a ban on fast-paced ads, following that he was seriously ill, partly due to his weight.
To date, Johnson launches the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe Cycling for their clients in obesity and will also be involved in an effort to increase cycling paths.
In addition, the advertising of fast-paced TV will be prohibited before 21 in the evening, according to British media sources.
COVID—19 has attracted us to the short- and long-term risk of being in overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to become healthier, more active and to eat more healthy food,” he said.
Johnson has struggled weight problems, but he was laid into intensive care when he was infected with the coronavirus this spring, and that is partly due to his weight because he is considered to have been so seriously ill.
Women better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution was the largest step in which the nation can take towards more authority distribution, transparency, and in counteracting corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to go about gear a little now, and who is better suited to this way, rather than the group of society that is easier to be in these values.
There are women,” says Helgi.
Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s solidarity.
To stand together and be together in leading changes.
So now we’re just coming to lead these changes.”
She said that she was a little gloomy over Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
We are not as ready to see what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and view everything that needs to be done.
There is lots.
We must know where we are coming and know the story and listen.
Listen to voices of marginalized groups.
We don’t live with the same rules all here,” says Helgi.
When asked, she told women to be in many ways in good matters in Iceland, but she added that, as in many other parts of Iceland, Icelanders have a super-critical value.
She said that the politics revolved around her own interests, authority, and powers that were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“Women have now created this group and come together and are just a little frustrated in the fact that the Althing intends to try to watch this referendum from 2012, she said.
“There are these feminine values we are thinking this from.
From human rights and nature conservation, we all really sit at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values would be the basis for the new constitution.
We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people who live in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can change differently,” says Helgi.
It is ridiculous that there is something natural law that women’s jobs are always less paid.
It is ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to stay in a fight just to achieve decent wages.”

Try to rob pedestrians in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center for a night after threatening pedestrians and trying to make money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two were arrested due to the matter.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in the slopes where its driver was at 146 km/h, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
Moreover, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
Police in the capital area had enough to rotate this night and were over 80 cases recorded in the journal of the police from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise notifications due to compliance.
Saturday's next night notifications were received of eleven noise-average, and this was a big part of the police's calendar.
In the night, however, 22 noise issues were ordered on board the police.
Six people were saved in the prison cell tonight.
In Árbær, the police was called for this night when the parties shot fireworks.
However, they had to avoid themselves when the police officers carried out to the park.
Nine drivers were also stopped for drunk driving and or drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre this night but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Two moved to reception after they fell on the face, one in the city center and the other in the Westtown.
One was moved to an accident after he was injured to jump in a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who drew a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
The caravan’s bike equipment was, according to the police’s calendar, in “very bad condition” and it was silenced.
Stay in the house of Monet about the shopping weekend
The house, which the escalator Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice in, is now for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next free nights in the house are around the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Given in Normandie, France.
The painting world famously lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet first got inspired to paint her gardens famous in this house.
If someone intends to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb’s page, it’s next free after week, on Sunday of the retail market, and could be ideal for some retail workers on vacation to hurry to book the painter’s house.
The two nights above a shopping weekend will not cost you more than US$964, or just over 130 thousand ISK as the news sheet is next.
Tugs in quarantine and some of them began to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been detected by the coronavirus within the last three days and most of the infected are disconnected.
Tens are in quarantine due to this, and some of them began to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were detected with the COVID-19 pandemic yesterday and two border screenings.
A specialist in the Directorate of Health says that the growing number of domestic infection does not necessarily mean that the virus is spread widely in the society.
It has been ordered from the previous national infection, and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think that it has gone irritated in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country but of course we need to be very well guarded now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of infection.
Most of them have been infected with people who came from abroad.
Further sampling takes place in the near term, which was in association with those infected are beginning to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no inflows and less about other respiratory infections, so we can be fairly liberally doing this test in people who during the influenza period would have found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
The infection is mostly completed, but it is not impossible for more people to quarantine.
Two of the infected people were diagnosed after attending sports events.
This has raised questions whether such an event is preselected.
The communication manager of the Public Administration says it slowly as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
Kamilla says almost impossible that the infected have been infected with sports tournaments.
If it does not go more into isolation from these individuals after dealing with them at these sports tournaments, we can claim that our anti-ageing practices have been active.
But it’s not revealed,” Kamilla said.
The procedures for the Department of Civil Protection are constantly audited.
We need to be ready to take into more recommendations or restrictions if it seems to have an occasion,” Kamilla said.
After more than a week, the numbers will be increased to thousands of people.
This new situation may affect the exclusions.
‘Severy meditation’ - See the menu of Elsa Viðars
Elisha Viðarsdóttir is a female actress in a football player and plays with Valur.
She is also a master’s student in nutritional science, mother, and works as a food scientist.
It needs a lot of energy for the day’s asthma and gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My regular day begins with attending work from eight,” says Elisha.
After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare the dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten at about three hours.”
Elsa loves to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
It is good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one element to empty the mind.”
Elisha does not come with any specific diet.
She is laying the final hand on a master’s thesis in nutrition and knows how well she feels to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
What is right for me is eating a variety of foods that are well formulated by proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.
I think it’s important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to sort food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritionally.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“I feel certain meditation about standing in the kitchen cooking and applying it very much into it.
I must say that confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe I'm a decent chef.”
Breakfast: oats, chia- seeds, hemp seeds, salt, small lemon juice, let lie in a almond milk overnight.
Top this meal so with what exists at any given time.
Most often it is a banana and crisp musli & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee woman.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruits or vegetables, flats, pure skyr with bananas and muesli, bread with toppings and so I could eat hummus with a spoon made of a box if appropriate.
Lunch: I often create all kinds of food great salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, lettuce, salad, baking vegetables with good dressing is a little bit what I’m working with.
If the layout goes completely out of the band (which happens often), the egg machine at work has brought me pretty often to the rescue, and then there are 2 bread slices with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, no more on you.
Interfere: Receive some carbohydrate for exercise, bread with topping, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: fish will be very often for my choice in home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian.
Interaction between the police and protesters in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, D.C., has declared an uproar state following a number of protests in the city centre.
The police seized yesterday to blaze bombs and peppers to tempt the fact that large areas of protesters conquered and stretched over many of the Houses of Parliament in the city.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation had been conducted at a police station yesterday, possible with some bombs.
Civil and police authorities say that protesters have stoned the police with rocks, bottles, bombs, and other vacantly, and was one police officer transferred to a hospital where it was done to injuries him.
However, the protests in Seattle were peaceful long away from the front.
The blow was their way to show protesters in Portland, Oregon, where in a city has repeatedly come to a fierce conflict between protests and armed forces of the federal police.
Where, like in more cities of the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, remembered Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on 25 May, protests systematic racism in an American society and requires improvements.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is still not valid for Icelandair's flight attendants to take effect at the end of the month.
Electronic voting on the Icelandic Civil Aviation Association on behalf of Icelandair ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says that Icelandair will not make a decision on the cancellation until the ruling is settled.
It’s definitely hanging out,” says Guðlaug Líney.
“There have been no redundancies, this must be scheduled to be able to human the machines.
So, of course, people are tirelessly after getting to know if it will be with work after the month of the month.”
An agreement signed for one week ago, on the eve of July 19.
It is assumed that it will enter into force until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the airlines had previously been involved in a vote.
On 17 July, the Board of Directors and the trustees of the Icelandic Aviation Association approved a general work stoppage at Icelandair.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to cancel negotiations with the airline, terminate all their flight attendants and seek agreements with other unions.
Then, the company’s pilots had to take on the work of safety items on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks that the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it’s hard to say about it.
People are affected by this procedure by Icelandair, when all the airlines were terminated and reported to be contracted with another trade union.
Now it turns out whether it has an effect,” she says.
940 flight attendants were operated by Icelandair at the end of April, around 900 of which was declared 95%.
The notice period is varying, for those who have shortest working time, it is three months and therefore ends at the end of the month of July-August.
There are about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants in that group.
What does the agreement not accept?
We wish for continued dialogue with our clients.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair’s requirements.
If it is denied, it is clear that the aviation industry has gone too far.”
Voting on collective agreements ends and Icelandair announces the results of Q2 tomorrow
The vote on a new collective wage agreement ends at 12 a.m.
The Icelandair accounts for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the Company’s income has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The Icelandic Aviation Association and the Confederation of Icelandic Employers (SA) commenced on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote on the agreement are Icelandair’s employees who pay membership fees to the airline.
On 19 July 2022, Icelandair and FÍ signed a new collective agreement on the eve of the Sunday of July, but Friday, Icelandair had spent talks with the airline after the number of flight attendants in the first election in July.
Icelandair had also told all the airlines on Friday, but they were withdrawn after the new agreement was signed.
According to new collective bargaining, airflow needs to be five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The agreement is valid until 2025, where the provisions of pilots and flight attendants have been integrated for how long a single shift can be taken.
The agreement was presented to members of the FÍ meeting at the Hilton Nordic hotel on Monday and gave many flight attendants a talk about satisfaction because of the agreement.
However, most people agreed to agree that the agreement must be approved to keep the FFÍ alive.
The Icelandair accounts for the second quarter to be announced tomorrow, with the EBITDA of the company, the operating performance for financial items and taxes, according to the preliminary operating results of negative USD 100 to USD 110 million, or about ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair issued temporary calculations on Wednesday, which said that the company’s income has amounted to USD 60 million in the quarter or ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and equivalents have been ISK 154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to issue the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair intends to finalize contracts with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before entering a share offering.
New variations rather than a new type of virus
“New virus means just that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been malling here in Iceland,” says Már Kristjánsson, a senior doctor at the hospital’s infectious disease department, about the news that “a new type of virus” has been detected in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday and two at the border.
One that had been identified had participated in the club's social activities at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the origin of the contagious meeting and infection is ongoing.
It was also detected by an individual who came to Iceland on 15 July and two of them that were in contact with him have started to show the symptoms of COVID—19.
Yesterday, during the last day, an infection associated with infection reported by the Icelandic genetic analysis was discovered, “a new type of virus that has not been identified before.”
The infection is completed in connection with that infection.
It is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is right to talk about a new variation of that virus rather than a new type of virus.
Asks what it means and if it could say something that the other wave of the pandemic is starting, Márr says that as if this is a single instance, and it could go so that nothing more from that.
However, if there are domestic cases that do not have a connection from abroad and have the same type of heritage as this particular variant then it would be possible to conclude [the second wave], but it is premature at such a stand,” explains Már.
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Iceland’s happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The award winning BBC draws on the probability of a fun video that highlights the country’s pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is special in the world and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places on each population.
The natural geothermal energy is its foundation, but also the tradition of swimming activities that are rich here.
Children’s swimming lessons were statutory in 1940, but older citizens are still not able to use the hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a permanent part of the country’s general welfare.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of the class and position.
Free from mobile phones, people discuss personal notes about home and space, or enjoy the similar powers of the water: meditation and charging the soul’s batteries and body.
On a steep download one hundred days in elections
Hundreds of days are until Americans go to elections and choose the president for four years.
Donald Trump seeks to re-elect, but he still has a steep chance to pick up.
Joe Biden, the upcoming candidate for the Democratic Party, has a high advantage on Trump at a national level, being examined by inspection surveys.
According to a new survey by AP news provider, the record number of Americans consider the nation to be on the wrong path.
Trump’s response as a result of the pandemic’s new coronavirus is also very inconclusive and, in addition, more Americans than before, the president has held badly on economic issues.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say Trump’s response to pandemic and 48 percent he said that he’s been holding well on economic issues.
In March, it was a ratio of 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, the Biden 49.99 per cent is accompanied by Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has attempted to move his attention from his performance towards Biden, under the so-called cultural debates, and to preach laws and regulations.
However, the availability of Biden is a great challenge to keep the attention on Trump and believe that it is very likely to be successful if the vote is really about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Trump also seem to come down to the MPs of the Republican Party and fear the Protestants that the Democrats could even reach the majority of the Senate of the United States, which until now has been very high.
Politico reported that in the days that the parties and the candidates follow comparable, and that is, now, the Republican Party would receive its greatest dissolution for decades.
Environments have proved to have a particularly bad issue in the 2016 parliamentary elections, and it is now a prospect that this trend will continue.
In the past days Trump has sought to scare the inhabitants of a suburb to accompany him, among other things, by saying that he will be Biden President, he will ruin the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has dropped regulation from Barack Obama’s time in the White House, intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He then urged the US to read an article by former Governor of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the United States’ suburbs, and Trump took place.
Your ‘Biden will ruin your neighborhoods and your US dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
The U.S. population is an increasingly growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of this group’s votes has become a president.
Except in 2012, when My Romney received the majority of votes from this group, but lost for Barack Obama.
Polls have shown that despite Trump’s fact that the majority of the fisheries sector has been heavily reduced.
Although it is different between the surveys, Biden has measured around fifteen percentage points for Trump in the web recently.
Regis Philbin's dead
The American television player Regis Philbin is dead, 88 in age.

He is best known for controlling the popular Live! with Regis between 1988 and 2011 with Katie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed episodes such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.

He was awarded six Emmy Awards in her career and was nominated for 37 times.
A statement from his family states that Philbin died of natural causes.
The number of colleagues, friends and fans have remembered his social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic Fire be at the end of the walk?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only World War II has provoked, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic Fire would be “the light to the end of the trails,” referring it to the coronavirus pandemic that the inhabited world now passes through.
Professionals have a year in addition to prepare for themselves and the authorities in Japan improve on costs due to delay.
However, everyone thinks a head, as much at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan, the Olympic Stadium would be celebrated this year by Japanese representatives.
They cried out and laughed for an exchange, since Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 games, but it was finished in the lower place for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo City and Japan would bathe themselves in the world’s attention.
The games should be held on July 24 to August 9 but have been postponed for years and begin instead of July 23, 2021 and ends on August 8, 2022.
If the coronavirus still becomes too much threat, the games will be cancelled.
However, no one wants to think completely then thinking at the end.
Olympic games are no ordinary sporting competition.
There is nothing to save, the show should always be fabulous and strive to top the last play.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the evaluation of the selections of the city’s promotions.
The more magnificent the presentation — the more likely to have a globule.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics or just over ISK 20 billion.
The second time, when the application for the 2020 Olympic Games, was USD 75 million, a total of ISK ten billion, were posted in the Promotion.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to have the games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent around ISK 30 billion to the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the ocean based on what it costs to build a Olympic village, stadiums and generally strengthen the country’s infrastructure to cope with such tournaments, prepare it and keep the Games themselves.
Japanese organizers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which would have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
In a report from the National Audit Office in Japan, which was published at the end of last year, it emerged that the cost would be doubled.
There will probably not be a fully assessment of the cost to postpone the game, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two to six billion in addition to the original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run from 15 to 30 billion.
There are so high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state are only enough for almost half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.
Olympic games are an event of the magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to review the figures and look at the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, many people seem to have found that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are, for example, jobs are very much short-term, but for a long time, cities often sit up with debtors and threatening operating costs small used structures.
Rio in Brazil sits up with significant liabilities because of the 2016 game and has been struggling to cost maintenance of all the large sports infrastructure built for the games.
It has been found that only 10 percent of those who received work-related Olympics in the city were unemployed in the past.
This means that it was not a new job, except in small terms.
In general, cities have not come out of their own financial position to keep Olympic games because of the cost of human activity built for the games.
The benefits are, however, considered to be as an increase in tourist traffic who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which is still very uncertain about the games in 2021.
Also, it is unclear whether the number of viewers usually attend the games.
However, the main issue is the honour chosen by the cities, but it is difficult to value for money.
Therefore, despite the enormous costs, the joy the games do not imply that it is possible to put on the price tag.
But although the exhibition is often impressive, and nowhere to be saved, this is not of course just money.
There are the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some athletes, it is surprising just a welcome to postpone the games.
Australian acrobat and gold winner in their article at the site Olympic games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, a chaolyzed and had been far from fun this summer, but the hope of being in a competitive shape for the play 2021.
It is therefore among the athletes who are just happy with the deadline, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to leave the games this year, they would have been held on time, in some cases, means that they will stop the competition before the games take place.
Trusted their body simply not to go through a year of rigorous exercise.
Few athletes were equally in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and the acrobatic star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold about her neck and one bronze.
Biles has been involved in several interviews in his US country in the past to discuss the Olympic Games.
However, she is not necessarily sure she will be on top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered hair age, it is at a higher level for a gymnastic woman at the forefront.
It’s a delicate issue,” says Biles, but smiles to another interview published on the 2022 Instagram page of the Olympic Committee, asked if it’s going to reach an equal level on the Games in 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.
I just don’t know if I still get to the top after a whole year of exercise,” says Biles.
She has previously spoken that her body can’t stand the pressures that come with fiddle training a lot longer.
Nevertheless, she exercises off the competition for the Olympic Games 2021.
Biles recognizes that it has been an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop suddenly training when the world pandemic stood high and the gym was shut down.
No exceptions were for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the other, she had to find various ways to keep fit just like others.
The basic form certainly better than most people.
We have a rigid plan now.
It was hard to start training first after the gym opened.
We started slowly but have returned to a full moment again and I will increase my training level and steadily as the year progresses.
We of course don’t know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held but we do practice based on that they’ll be, can’t be another.
I have put too much on myself to leave the sport now,” says Biles.
With it as well as any doubts or perhaps further awareness that the situation can arise that the games will not be held in 2021.
To predict, however, it is hopeless.
No one can know how the status of the pandemic of the coronavirus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games because they will be held a year.
Perhaps the Olympic Fire will be at the end of the Covid Walk.
Canceled wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was married to the ex-Barette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
I think there are other things to think about driving right now,” said the actress in a conversation with People.
We would like to marry some time and have the dream wedding and have all the present that are dear to us.
But we decided to strike it every step, focusing on what is important to us right now and it is to help sharing information about the importance of wearing masks and keeping up at home.
I look more into the world than the wedding matter these days.
There’s a lot going on and we’re going to focus our attention on what’s going on in the world.”
