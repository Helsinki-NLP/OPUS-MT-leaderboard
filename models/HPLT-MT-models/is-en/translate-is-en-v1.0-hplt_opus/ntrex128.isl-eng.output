Welsh officials are concerned about ‘looking like a fool’
Fear is in some councilors due to a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have arisen as a result of the plan to change the Council's name to the Welsh parliament.
Councilors from all parties are concerned that it could make them ridiculed.
One Labour official said his party was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers living outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means mad, and pwp means faeces.
A member of the Plaid Cymru group said the group as a whole was “unhappy” and made other recommendations.
A Welsh Conservative party official said his party had an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be noted that the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is currently working on a legislative bill to submit the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names that are taken over the members of the Council will, of course, lie with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council issued the results of a survey among the public, which showed great support for calling the Council the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the council, the WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh MPs) were chosen, but the MWP was most supported by the public in the polls.
According to the news, councilors are now making alternative proposals, but it could prove difficult to reach an agreement for the Council chairman, Elin Jones, to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the dismissal of council members and the organisation of the committee system.
Council members will be able to vote on their title when the debate on the bill begins.
Macedonians vote in referendum on name change in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
This case was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province with the name Macedonia.
The City of Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim in its territory and has repeatedly challenged their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the referendum on the change of names, has said he will not consider the election valid.
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said, however, that the change of name is simply the price that needs to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells sound when churches in Harlem are struggling
The older people I've talked to said that there was a bar and a church on every street corner," said Mr. Adams.
There is no one there today.
He said it was understandable that the bars were falling.
People have other ways of meeting” today, he said.
Bars are no longer the centres of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect “and sooner or later they will return to the starting square.”
He added that perhaps churches would be replaced by residential buildings that would be full of people who will not assist in rescuing the remaining sanctuary areas of the neighborhood.
By far the largest number of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and will therefore accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people moving into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and the St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A group of black men who had worked in the vicinity took over the building.
The Black Church took over the St. Martin's Church under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who initiated the boycott of shopkeepers on the 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who longed to hire black workers or provide them with promotion.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of the Reverend Johnson's congregation planned to rebuild it and they also had the clock game built.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Reverend Johnson, called the clock game a proud "clock of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Culture Treasure” and “a unique historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock card in the world as a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved on to a larger clock card in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not received anyone else in his place.
Over the past few months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some recruited by the leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The Church Council – which oversees the parish and is composed of Church leaders – wrote the diocese in July and expressed its concern that the diocese “would seek to bring the costs over” the Council, even if it had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who dived after a lobster in California
According to the authorities, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him on Saturday when the boy was diving after a lobster in California on the first day of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before seven in the morning near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy shout for help and then rowed over along with a group of others to help catch him up from the water.
Hammel said at first that he thought it was only the excitement of getting lobster, but then "he realized that the boy shouted "I was bitten!
I was bitten!
All his cuff was torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
I cried to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken by a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark is attacked by the boy.
The chief of the Coast Guard, Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before, but it was not of a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered severe damage to the upper body.
Authorities closed beach access from Ponta Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said there were over 135 different types of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to enter the UK’s cosmetic market
Sainsbury’s plan is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shopping-style cosmetics shelves and with highly trained assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, worth 2.8 billion pounds, and is increasingly growing while sales of fashion and household goods are declining. The larger cosmetics shelves will be tested in 11 stores all over the country and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Investing in cosmetics is part of the way supermarkets use shelf space that was previously utilized by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s claims will double its cosmetic range up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive extra space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store is also planning to re-launch its boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of the products are vegan-friendly, but younger consumers demand it more and more.
In addition, the perfume shop Fragrance Shop will test the stands in Sainsbury’s two stores, the first one opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
E-commerce and increased consumer tendency to buy small amounts of food daily in neighborhood stores means that supermarkets need to work more to get people to come to their homes.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe said the stores would increasingly resemble shopping malls as the retail chain tries to fight against the low-cost stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat camps since both chains were bought two years ago, according to which it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt by the store to enliven its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed well.
Sainsbury’s tested a partnership with Boots around the year 2000, but it ended due to a dispute over how to share the revenue from the sale of drugs in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of 281 drug stores to the Lloyd’s drug store owner Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will have a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skin brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s marketing manager, said: “We have revolutionised the look on our cosmetic shelves to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special training for staff who will be on hand for advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need. The charming environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting cosmetic store that transforms old shopping habits.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby cancels a £11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den's show, became "Early Angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million deal with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories brands, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand.
Willoughby, 37, announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, behind with a sore forehead by opting out of the popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been "the abhorrent" at a difficult Tuesday meeting at his trading center in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the popular television woman admitted she doesn't have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly due to the new contracts worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, and was designed to double Willoughby’s assets, with an estimated value of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was planning to pull out of Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s priority list.
It was supposed to be her future project that would generate her income over the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was completely open to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line would go on the market.
There’s a full stock of products at Marlow’s headquarters ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, one of the UK’s most popular stars, can cost millions of people because of massive product investments, ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and household products, and potentially cause further delays in the product line going on sale.
This could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as Chairman in March.
The pair spend their summers together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's company, which produces television.
Willoughby will replace Ant McPartlin as the manager of ITV series I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said: “We don’t want to say anything about his business.”
It’s hard to say, “And then we fell in love.”
He contradicted the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would think inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive towards the leaders of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much behind?
Trump said, mimicking the voice of a reporter.
I haven't left anything behind.
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, talks about shutting down nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s chief ambassador, Ri Yong Ho, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not received an “appropriate response” from the United States during North Korea’s first steps towards nuclear disarmament.
He said that instead, the United States maintained a trade ban for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was more positive in his speech.
We get along very well with North Korea,” he said.
We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had been successful – missile tests had stopped, hostages had been released, and the remains of American soldiers had been returned home.
He also defended his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds have perished
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, an international humanitarian organization was told that theirs was not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, but it is a prerequisite for international organizations to start aid operations there.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have clearly stated that they do not intend to ask for assistance from international organizations, so this is difficult,” said Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Organization, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist with the aid effort.
Given how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is very badly prepared to defend against the forces of nature.
Flood defences have been built in Aceh, but they are a rare sight on other shorelines.
It seems that the absence of tsunami defense whistles in Palu has further exacerbated the casualties, even if a warning has been issued.
Even under the best of circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has docked in Lombok to foster the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it the main objective of his campaign to reform Indonesia's degraded transport routes, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration, but next year's election will be held.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with a lasting tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where the members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious policy.
Over 1000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing against Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring on Saturday's 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a shipment from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal was under 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried a shot at the goal towards the other side.
The ball flew high over the goal and towards its right corner.
The ball eventually crossed the Kepa Arrizabalaga, which jumped up, and into the net.
I just wanted to get to this position, catch the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as forward as possible, so I tried to create as much time as I could,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and touching once, not thinking so much about it, but just taking a shot.
Chelsea scored over 1-0 in the half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored on the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic and then sprinted from the centre to Liverpool's quarterback.
Kovacic made the ball move quickly in the middle.
Then he sent the ball forward impressively and sent Hazard in for a penalty area.
Hazard ran off and scored in the far-angle with a left-foot shot by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the semi-finals of the Premier League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Number of deaths increased to 832 after a tsunami in Indonesia
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country’s disaster facility early on Sunday.
At a press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the organization, said that a large number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed on Friday and were 7.5 points on the Richter scale, causing tsunamis up to 6 metres high.
The city of Palu, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with debris from buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they saw or heard anything.
Investigator Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I would like to ask everyone around John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
Also, I would like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have caught something in a photo with their car cameras to contact us, because they could have important information for our investigation.”
Police spokesman confirmed that the woman who died had lived in Birkenhead and found her in an apartment.
This afternoon, people who thought they knew her have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and the police say they are working to inform the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one could come into or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours could pass until they can go back in.
A police officer heard a man say that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She says, "It's so horrible."
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the marked area and one car outside.
A number of police officers stood inside the marked area and observed the residential buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact anonymously with the Crime Service line by phone 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 from 30 September.
The British Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "rewriting the story"
The ban of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitious Puritan escorts on so many of England’s cultural and religious jewels.
However, Cromwell said Mr. Crick's proposal was "faithful" and "an attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate surrounding the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be hit.
The resistance of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is an indication of the spirit of the 19th century and is part of the history of a man who many believe is still deserving of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps in the late 19th century rather than today, to have been the protector of Congress against external pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still a lot of historical controversy whether this description is altogether correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts that were in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of that conflict.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his accomplishments as the protector of the state.”
Pig attacks Chinese farmer and kills him
Pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him on the market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, named only by his last name “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near a stall on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, according to news from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pigsty on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to him, he had traveled with his uncle from the neighboring Yunnan region on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the uncle found him dead and saw that a door into a nearby pigsty stood open.
He said that inside the stall there was a large boar with a bloody mouth.
A trial confirmed that the 250 kg boar had killed the farmer, according to the report.
My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded," the uncle said, with the last name "Wu", at the Guiyang Evening News news conference.
Recording from a security camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed their pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to news, Yuan’s family and market owners are in talks for compensation for his death.
There are documented cases of attacks on people by pigs, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously wounded the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig tied a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that blood taste can provoke aggressiveness in them.
They're just playing.
They like to snuggle and are curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Rose's hurricane carry heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
As predicted, the strength of the hurricane, Rosa, is declining as he crosses the colder seas on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rose will carry with her a lot of rainfall that could cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rose became a hurricane in category 1, with a wind force of 136 km per hour, at 5 o'clock in the morning towards the east coast time on Sunday, and he was located just over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a slump in the formation of the Pacific Ocean and it will go east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rose arrives on Monday as a tropical storm, she will be accompanied by a high tropics drift towards the north into the southwestern part of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Since then, the tropics will blend with the lowlands approaching and forming vast rainfall across the southwestern part of the country in the coming days.
Local 2.5 to 10 cm precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, movement of soil and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in most Arizona states.
There is a possibility of sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised against going on foot into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into muddy rivers, and thunderstorms can lead to storms and dust storms.
The lowlands approaching will carry a local outpouring in certain areas along the coast of Southern California.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation, which could result in a slight movement of soil and slippery roads.
This is the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Several scattered tropical sheds will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rainfall spreads across a larger area late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four states on Tuesday and last out on Wednesday.
High temperatures in October are expected throughout the United States as the Arctic is cooling, but the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A good example of a large temperature difference was observed in the mid-states of the United States on Sunday.
There is almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and spread out again.
A large part of the central and eastern United States is expected to get a warm start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the northeast.
Temperatures could go up to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above the average for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's exciting testimony on Tuesday, and Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to the woman who accused him of sexual assault that had taken place in the nineties.
At the same time, the political stalemate continued, and television stations paused the regular agenda to release the latest news on Friday: Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona filed a bill so the FBI could investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had groped at her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was confident that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company measured average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also generally has trouble measuring people’s views in offices.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar in size to the finals of the football or the Oscar festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the respondents, who took the whole day, looked at Fox News Channel or $5.69 million.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued to be high after the trial.
Flake was the centre of the game on Friday.
After the Office of this Republican Congress announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh in favour, CNN and CBS filmed him when protesters made a call on Friday morning as he tried to enter an elevator to meet with the Justice Committee.
He was downcast for a few minutes while it rained over him in a live broadcast by CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
People said to him, “You have power while so many women stand powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would comment further at a committee meeting.
All of the cable and television stations had a live broadcast later when the Justice Committee voted on whether the appointment of Kavanaugh should be forwarded to the Senate.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominees next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was partly convinced by a dialogue with his friend Chris Coons, Senator of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several other senators thereafter.
Flake's vote was crucial because it was clear that Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has given permission for the FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
May, UK Prime Minister, accuses critics of "being in politics" over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused her of leaving the European Union of “being in political play” about the future of the UK and undermining the interests of the country.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend a conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, 29 September 2018.
In another interview, which was published next to her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, gave the so-called Chequers-program on Brexit, saying that the proposal that the UK and the European Union should impose tariffs on each other would be “absolutely absurd”.
Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested one suspect on the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge said.
Authorities posted a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, saying Sims had lost their glasses during the clashes.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they had found a genetic material from Simpson on them, according to CBS's sister company WAFB.
The police said Simpson confessed to the interrogation that he had shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, there was a certain guarantee of $350,000.
The Office of the Forensic Pathologist in East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a gun shot in the head and down the throat.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Special Forces, the Police Crime Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, head of sports at LSU, thanked law enforcement officers for their “carrying and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 rebounds for each game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday that the team was "stricken" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
It's something you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention recommended Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center observed vibrations and earthquakes from the volcano.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in the districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometres southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 on Richter struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in a conflict with the Catalan separatists just before the birthday of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independant protesters confronted the riot police, and thousands took part in protests to mark the first birthday of the controversial Catalan election to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned rioters with eggs and threw powder paint that formed dark dust on the streets, which were usually otherwise filled with tourists.
The fighting also broke out later in the day and the police used the bats to keep the attacks under control.
The groups of the separatists shouted, “We do not forget and do not forgive” for a few hours while their opponents shouted back, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were in need of care because of the minor injuries they suffered in the protests, according to the local media.
There is considerable tension in the area of independence one year after the 1 October referendum was declared illegal by the Madrid authorities, but was welcomed by the Catalan separatists.
The majority voted for independence, but participation was poor as most of those who opposed the separation ignored the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to stop the election at various polling sites across the region, which caused conflict.
Independent groups had stayed outside overnight on Friday to prevent protests to support the country’s police.
The protest took place but was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the demonstration of the separation with his wife and said he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
Last year we had some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry for joy over being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia’s independence parties have had a hard time keeping the damp this year, as many of their best-known leaders are either in voluntarily exiled or in pending trial due to their role in organizing the vote and the Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the protest to support the police on his phone, said the politicians of both parties had encouraged the dispute.
Tensions are increasing all the time,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail and asked for a trial from late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in the field of democratic values and the oppression we have seen by the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after driving a car to a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving to a Londonderry house.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 to a British time.
Bob Blemmings, investigator, said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that a crucifixion was shot in the direction of the vehicle.
Menga scores in 1-0 victory for Livingston against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga secured the victory of Livingston
Livingston's team, who came from the lower division, came Rangers in open shields and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 appearances as manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the difference and Gary Holt’s team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard has not yet won in the Premier League this season and plays against Hearts, which are eight points ahead in the top spot, next Sunday.
For this game, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six victories, and Holt Master Trainer has not yet had to experience a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against bitless guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored a goal, but their bonework caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot a pass after sliding through the defense to receive a bald pass from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let Rangers play in front of them in quiet, knowing that they could cause the visitors trouble in the right places.
And that's how important the goal was scored.
Rangers got a free kick and Livingston won a goal win. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who took over the mission and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the ball but the defense of the locals was unbreakable, and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put much effort on himself.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by the feet of Allan McGregor, Rangers goalkeeper, and Lithgow shot from the goal after retrieval from Livingston.
The questions were constantly caught in the penalty area of Livingston but were kicked out, and two claims for penalty kicks - after Halkett's defense against substitute Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were dismissed.
“Grazy” at Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and finals for Livingston.
For a normal man, they did a great job and continued to exceed all expectations on their rise.
Their style of play and team members have hardly changed since they got back in the top division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having polished the team together since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, captain, was extremely good and led a fully organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on her toes all the time.
Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard's control, they played far below expectations.
They were unable to complete their offensives and managed only once to open the stadiums of the locals so this should be an awakening for the Rangers who are currently sitting in the middle of the division.
Erdoğan receives mixed reception in Cologne
It was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdoğan's controversial visit to Germany with the purpose of improving the relationship between the two NATO nations.
There has been a dispute between them due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
Erdoğan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city is home to most non-Turkish residents.
The police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from accumulating in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters could be seen in its vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also heard and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two protesters reflect how controversial this visitor is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford collision: A cyclist died in a car accident
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a crowded street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10.15am local time.
The driver stopped and the paramedics were treated, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash happened a few months after another cyclist died in a crash where the driver drove away on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident point.
Police said she was working on identifying the man and letting his closest relatives know.
The road has been closed and other roads have been diverted and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riots
Six prison guards were injured when riots broke out in a men's prison, according to a report from the prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9.30 a.m. at the local British local time on Sunday and are still raging.
The "Tornado" special forces have been called into the area to try to restrain the riots, in which eight prisoners are involved, and are only in one of the branches of the prison.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Certainly trained prison guards have been called out to handle a case currently going on in the Long Lartin prison.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
There is no violence in our prisons and we make it clear that the responsible people will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars and locks.”
Over 500 prisoners sit in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was announced that the prison director had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to the site to deal with a serious disruption of peace, where staff with billiard bullets were attacked.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City by flooding (drying areas could benefit)
It is rare for tropical depression to pass over Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week when the remains of the Hurricane Rose are crossing the southwest, with the risk of a sudden flood.
The country's Meteorological Office has already issued warnings on avalanches for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to cross Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with precipitation.
The Phoenix Meteorological Office said on Twitter that only ten hurricanes have managed to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or depressions less than 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 km of the Arizona border.
The last predictions from the country's hurricane center predict 5-10 cm of rainfall, with occasional rainfall up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
The precipitation is likely to be 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with the possibility of occasional precipitation up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of a sudden flood, the precipitation from Rosa could be a blessing because there are a lot of droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause a lot of damage, some of this precipitation will have a positive effect, as the drought is now in the southwestern part.
According to the US drought surveillance, there is at least a very high drought rate for over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest category,” according to the weather.com news.
First, the Hurricane Rose will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rose was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean and its force is therefore declining.
As a result, he is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a potential for heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
A precipitation of 7.5 to 15 cm is expected in Baja California and in the northwestern part of Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 cm of precipitation,” the Weather.com report said.
Rose will then head north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the Arizona border in the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger that is expected to arise from Rosa or its remains is the extreme precipitation in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert area of the United States,” said the country’s hurricane center.
This precipitation is expected to cause life-threatening floods and soil movements in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 04.00am local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "continuous".
One 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked for witnesses who could have phone recordings of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh “had to feel evil and anger” from the Democratic Party
A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had “a sense of evil and anger” from the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified to parliament on Thursday that he denied allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her a few decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to the Committee on its allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that “the Americans had seen genius and manliness and courage” Kavanaugh the other day.
A vote to confirm a Kavanaugh judge is a vote that confirms one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an impressive CV as a public official,” he told a group of his West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
There are five weeks in one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running for it, but I really do,” he said.
That's why I'm going around the field to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that Democrats were working to “prohibit and hinder.”
The first key vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination should take place no later than Friday, according to the Republican leadership in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died after an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and it is likely that the number of deaths will rise
At least 384 people were killed and many were washed away by a huge wave of skulls on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves of skulls on the beach at sunset, washed a large number of people out at sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The tsunami formed after an earthquake of 7.5 degrees on Richter.
When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they died,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson of the Indonesia disaster facility, at an information meeting in Jakarta.
The tsunami didn’t come alone, it took cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open ocean at 800 kilometres before it hit the beach.
Some climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transported to 24 centres in Palu.
Photographs from the air, published by the disaster facility, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to ride across the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were detected in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Institute for Food and Technology, said in a statement that the energy released from the large quake on Friday was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under debris from collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coast line 300 km north from Pala in an area called Donggala that is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communicating “completely down and no information is received” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
Over 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The agency was criticized by many on Saturday for notifying that a tsunami had hit Pala, although public officials said the waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media one could hear a shout from the upper floor of a building to warn the people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Just minutes later, the tsunami hits the beach and carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a lack of electricity that hindered communication around Pala and made it difficult for authorities to organise relief work.
The military is starting to send aircraft with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the region still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for relief and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is planning to visit Palau on Sunday.
The number of deaths exceeds 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The staff of the World Vision from Donggala have reached the whole of the city of Palu, where they seek refuge in the camp cities that were set up in the park outside their offices.
People said they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Helping groups have started a difficult job, but some have complained that foreign helpers with a lot of expertise were prevented from traveling to Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start arriving if the accident zone is declared a disaster zone.
It has not been done yet.
This is still a local accident zone,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared this to be a disaster zone, we can open up foreign aid, but no declaration has yet been made.”
When the second night fell over Pala after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, friends and their families, who are still missing, kept hoping that their loved ones would be one of the miracle stories that shed hope on the depressing headlines accompanying natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, assistants rescued a woman who had been trapped under a ruin for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian glider, had been the coach of two sailors, who is now missing, for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked into the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
As a man with long experience on a sailplane, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after news was received within the gliding group because the Roa Roa hotel collapsed, he had sent a WhatsApp message desperately to the contestants who stayed in Palu and participated in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray sign, instead of a blue one.
I think that means the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 upon filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport Police.
The driver had been emptying the ATM in the entertainment area and was about to fill more money on him, said Dennis McCarthy, police officer, in the announcement.
As he was doing his job, another man came “running behind the Brink employee” and stole a money bag that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects escape from the scene, according to the report, but the police did not disclose how many people were involved.
Those who may have information about the suspects are asked to contact the police in Newport on tel. +354 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Kanye West is going to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change happens to his participation in the Saturday Night Live episode, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the episode, but she resigned for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but there is also a shortening of his current name.
I think “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier in the year when he discussed the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the evil, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West colleague, has also written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's elected president vows not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians, now the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised to “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful protest march in the square, killing up to 300 people at a time when the leftist movements of students were taking root all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to assist young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly grant and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of learning opportunities attract young people to crime.
The U.S. should double its budget for artificial intelligence
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds it spends on research in that area, says AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The remarks were said after the different departments of the US government issued reports of artificial intelligence, even though the United States had no formal overall plan for artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in artificial intelligence by 2030.
It would be a good start to double the money spent on artificial intelligence, considering that all other countries are so much further behind the US, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of capital could double the chances of the next big discovery in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China.
He worked on artificial intelligence in the nineties at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the best player in Othello, and later worked as a Director at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department at Google.
Lee talked about previous technical competitions, which were held by U.S. authorities, such as the defense robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
It’s not China that snatches the main thinkers, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired geniuses from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its AI research.
I feel that those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should receive a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament issued its future artificial intelligence programme in July 2017.
China’s Institute of Natural Sciences provides funds to people who work at higher education institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a artificial intelligence center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
In terms of NSF, it invests more than $100 million annually in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, U.S. legislation, which was intended to create a security council on artificial intelligence, has not progressed for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether the country’s name should be changed to the “Republic of North Macedonia” in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and argues that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on their territory and therefore denied them entry into the NATO and EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the identity of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: “Do you want to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to the agreement with Greece?”
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair charge for Macedonia to get membership of alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came here today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will comply with it and bind it into law.
The amendment would require the approval of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The electoral commission said that nothing unusual had been announced at 1 in the afternoon.
On the other hand, the participation was only 16 per cent, based on 34 per cent participation in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum on whether to change the country’s name, which would facilitate its entry into the NATO and the European Union, into the Macedonian Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the session in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked on preparing a small range and stacking chairs in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads high, not going through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring the necessary funding to Macedonia, with the percentage of unemployed people over 20 percent.
I think the vast majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the population is in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said consent would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that is lower than the minimum required.
Another survey from the TV channel Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, attendance must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not approved, it could mean the first serious blow to the government’s policy, which is favored by the West, since it took over in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went lightly with Brighton's defense in Manchester City's victory 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the offensive.
He sprinted past Brighton's three defenders and then went out to the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He passed one defender and then ran away some more just to Brighton’s penalty area.
Then he sent to the left and found there Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch inside the penalty area to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Brighton’s goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the goal.
Aguero has some foot problems,” City Secretary General Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the Premier League game.
Mark arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero was sent far inside Brighton in that attack.
He sent an impressive long ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling towards the other side.
Forward City sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City plays against Hoffman in the Champions League at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout match against Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals there was not much reason to force forward another start.
But the rival Scherzer hopes to be thrown on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to get to the finals, but they have a one-game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
Rockies got at least a wildcard with their 5-2 win on Nationals on Friday night, but the team still strives to reach their first league title.
Even if we play for free, we can at least play for an electric atmosphere in Denver, and the other team is definitely going to play their best game this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday’s game, but they are expected to make Scherzer throw in these conditions.
Scherzer, who was starting play for the 34th time, took a practice session on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his usual rest day.
This right hand thrower at Washington is 18-7 with 2,53 ERAs and 300 wind strokes in 220 2/3 cycles this season.
Trump visits West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
Everything is at stake in November.
It is five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of the big, big... I don’t offer myself, but do, though, that’s why I go around the field to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means needed, you see the cruelty, the evil.
No matter who they hurt, over who they have to go to gain power and control, they just want power and control, we don’t give it to them.
He said Democrats are working to "stay and hinder".
And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, saying that the Democrats were "angry and wicked and unjust.
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate's ruling committee, by name, and was answered with a loud bullet from the audience.
Do you remember her response?
Was it you who leaked the document?
Ha, what.
No, no, no. I waited for one... it was really bad physical expression, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a tolerant church.
He can’t stand those who speak his mind.
When Momentum activists in my category voted to give me a recommendation, it was hardly surprising.
I am after all the last of many Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our thoughts.
Joan ryan, my MP, received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudice against the Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to give me a recommendation was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar to issues and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to leave no one behind and be successful.”
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday meetings have often been just that.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a “milder and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views have not passed in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged by the party’s leaders to be acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues, who I previously thought had similar political views to me, began to expect me to take a total turnaround and supported opinions that I would never have previously agreed with, whether it was about national security or a common EU market.
Every time I speak publicly - and then it doesn't matter what I say - it follows a crawl of abominations on social media called for my expulsion, central politics denied and told me that I shouldn't be in the workplace.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my colleagues, as the most comments I get to me are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who have to endure the cavities of sexual or prejudiced insults on a daily basis but never retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments in this political era is the normality of attacks and insults.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the church and with each impeachment proposal or amendment of the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly narrower.
I’ve been given many recommendations over the past two years, not to get too high and then I’ll be “okay” with myself.
But I decided not to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Labor Union as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the neglect of Thatcher’s government, which left my classroom in disrepair, I have advocated for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in a Town Council or a Parliament.
I have never given my political views, nor at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policies and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would only like to say that when the country is headed for Brexit, which will harm our home, business and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy devoted to my leadership.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns may have skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this hilarious game of the day in the Tennent’s Premiership league.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
Finally, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made the locals happier and Peter Murchie the coach had the full right to be satisfied.
We’ve had tough opposition in our games so far and are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Ayr deserves praise, they took advantage of their opportunities better than us.”
Mark Grant Anderson came across Ayr in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo turned his attack, but a yellow card on the Scottish captain, who was allowed to play the game with Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by penalty before scoring with a kick right before half, then a touchdown, and Ayr came over 17-5 at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half of the power and touchdown of Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned the offensive, the goal difference decreased to five points.
A long pause was then required to foster serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off the playground, and after that Ayr still increased her leadership with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the offensive.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson then received the yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of being a man with a touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough offensive.
However, the locals came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card for having tackled a Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's attack, after a free kick.
Climo turned forward, as he did again immediately after the reboot, after Kyle Rowe captured David Amrstrong from the penalty area and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchpoint.

The Sea is Ours: The Coastless Country of Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen guard the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
General construction flag blue flag.
Navy bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to sea.
It is our duty to recover it.”
Across the entire landlocked Bolivian era of the coastline, which was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century, still in fresh memory - along with the desire to sail through the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on 1 October after five years of litigation.
Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, waits for the ruling with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many citizens of Bolivia will observe the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in The Hague will rule Bolivia in favor of their claim that Chile is obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades of difficult dialogue.
The ruling on Monday is also extremely important for Evo Morales, the country’s president of Indian descent, who will have a controversial fight for reelection next year.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts think it unlikely that the court ruling in favour of Bolivia, and that it would little change if he did.
The court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to issue land from Chile and has provided that the ruling will not affect the outcome of the possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the court comes just six months after hearing the final speech indicates that the case “wouldn’t have been complicated,” said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been an issue of Bolivia for the promotion, but rather that they have caused a regression of the country.
The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morales' militant rhetoric has reduced all goodwill from Chile, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court had taken an unusual short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile” and an opportunity to “end a dispute that dates back 139 years, both countries for the benefit of the world,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using this issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to recover from the past.
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow up on the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His comments now come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is “dreamers” to think that the ongoing US sanctions and protests against the end of the Korean War will ever kneel to North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of large headgear that will come in boutiques near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or be completely covered by the sun, look no further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a variety of weird hats in oversized sizes for their SS19 lineup in the fashion scene that fascinated the jet team during the fashion week in Paris.
A number of photos of very unsuitable hats have been posted on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations exhibited at fashion shows.
The main work by Valentino was a large light brown hat with wide ribbons that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Of the other oversized accessories, watermelons could be seen laid gems, a man’s hat and even a pineapple, but these items are not designed to keep the heat on their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced a variety of strange masks, precisely at the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One mask resembled a diving apparatus with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other resembled a melting ice cream in a bread form.
If you want to stick to fashion, you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon come on sale in boutiques near you.
Big hats come close to the heels of “La Bomba”, a straw hat with over 60cm large stripes that has been trimmed all the way from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion brand behind the very impractical hat that was seen on all social media was the inspiration for another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene – a beach bag made of straw that was almost as large as the swimsuit-dressed model that carried it.
The orange straw case, with a straw and a white leather handle, was the main part of the Paris Fashion Week’s La Riviera SS10 fataline Jacquemus.
Luke Armitage, the stylist of the famous people, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appearing in boutiques for next summer – as the designer has caused such a huge impact, it should be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a must for cosmopolitan citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for their outstanding performance and it has continued in 2018 with new, impressive test results, which are still strengthened by individual and group results in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
These schools have up to 30,000 students all over Scotland, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further graduate studies, the career they have chosen and their position as cosmopolitans.
As a teaching sector that can put together and teach by specially designed curriculums, we see that new language continues to be a popular learning tool in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that touches his mind.
If you talk to him in his native language, that touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can not just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages are at the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students passing exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a decent grade of A.
The data collected from 74 schools within SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received a decent grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received a grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the necessary skills that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, languages, as an elective subject, are placed in the same place as scientific-related subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and elsewhere.
An opinion poll conducted in 2014 by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills revealed that for the reasons employers found it difficult to recruit, 17 per cent was due to a lack of people with language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future work.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real advantage in the future if they learn a different language, but it is a skill that lasts a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will provide a multilingual character with an automatic advantage over the competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to sustain dialogue, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage point, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for children of today to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilingualism, especially in emerging countries, will give children a better opportunity to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, there are differences between schools which language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical novel languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be the most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specially trained teachers.
Scottish private schools undertake to provide a learning environment, which will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It can not be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be essential for the future of the country, and it will be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be seen as “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer a choice, variety and superiority to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards is Chairman of the Scottish Private School Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided for how many minutes he will play.
It will be longer than a minute and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, journalist for the Lakers said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
During this period of my career, I don’t have to play games for the season to prepare,” he said.
Timing for Trump's West Virginia election and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of elections and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his choice of a new Supreme Court judge has been put on hold, Trump aims to build support for the next midterm elections, because Republicans are at risk of losing control over Congress when votes will be cast in November.
What time is Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 19.00 this evening, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice, where there was tension over sexual harassment allegations. The Senate’s vote to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI is investigating the allegations.
But the main goal of the meetings at Trump is to help the Republicans recover from a better move, but their awaited tough elections in November.
The message from Trump’s campaign was that the five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at “filling up the volunteers and supporters of enthusiasm that Republicans are trying to protect and complement the majority they have in Congress and Parliament,” Reuters reports.
A parliamentary board is so necessary for the president's plan that he will travel to as many states as possible when a busy campaign season begins," Trump said in a statement.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and supporters are expected to come from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburgh media will report on it," according to West Virginia Metro News.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent will in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia, to the Senate, but he is down in the polls.
It’s not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” Simon Haeder, political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows willingness to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three unilateral laps, the quadrant, which was afternoon on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this competition for the Ryder Cup.
A swing in success is a sports concept that has been invented and that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say that success is now?
They had a six-point lead, and now it’s four points, so the success lies on our side now, I suppose,” said Jordan Spieth, as he set out in today’s competition.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four levels ahead with an additional twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have a bit of wind in the sails and they can be hopeful of many things, especially the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played everything from the tee to the flat and leads by his example.
The cheers rose as the ring went on and he put down an important putt to take all four points in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two matches.
His putt, which secured them a win in the 15th hole, received a similar shout of joy, a shout of the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team still has a winning hope.
You just have to dive deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but breathtaking European couple has won four games of four and cannot do anything wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who had a flush on Saturday afternoon, but they also managed to avoid a flush on Saturday morning, on Friday afternoon, and on the nine-hole course on Friday morning.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the couple who need to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal the potential victory of the European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun sets over Le Golf National stadium.
The best option would be that both do it simultaneously on different holes.
It is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-game in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
A flush and two doubles on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never managed to scratch out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and four-way games are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pair, their advice, the advice they don’t give and how the schedule can change in a single turnaround.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a considerable advantage before the final day, but this four-season team also showed that the US has the fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 leadership for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good head start for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four-ball and four-ball game of Saturday, with the lead 10-6 against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, and have received four points on Le Golf National Stadium.
European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to get back the prize cup, which it lost on the Hazeltine stadium two years ago, showed great dominance over the United States’ teams in the quadruple game of the morning and won 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the four-game series and won two games but failed to win the scoring difference.
Team Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname “Molliwood” after a magnificent weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great team spirit and won the downside Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who drew himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius occasionally, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball games and four-ball games and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for a four-ball match in the morning, returned to his club, Henrik Stenson in the four-game, winning 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not succeed on this mild and humiliating day in the southwest of Paris.
Triple winner in big golf competitions, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the United States with two points on Saturday.
They won with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four-ball matches and came back and beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in four-card matches after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four points at the beginning of an individual competition, although Furyk's team would only need a draw to keep the cup going.
However, after being second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack appears to be overpowering.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament “impossible” without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased their distrust in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to unilaterally dismantle its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the UN General Assembly’s annual meeting, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken “substantial measures to demonstrate goodwill” last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, taking down the nuclear test area, and promising to stop the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first.
Although Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “leveled” approach to nuclear disarmament as North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed specific in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament cleanly as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement during the first meeting between US and North Korean leaders, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work on the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump issued a promise to secure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a solution to formally end the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States has said Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons behind first.
Washington has also resisted calls for a severe trade ban on North Korea.
The United States demands that “nuclear disarmament take place first” and increase the pressure by using trade restrictions to achieve it, and even protest the declaration of ending the war,” Ri said.
There are only dreamy people who know nothing about us thinking that a trade ban can put us on our knees.
But the problem is that continued trade bans increase our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke of earlier this week.
The minister instead spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, South Korean leaders in the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, then the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula wouldn’t be this stalemate.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he said in the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea's missiles to the U.S. mainland after Trump called Kim "a rocketman" in a suicide attempt.
Last year, Trump threatened to “deplete” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take a step towards disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that trade bans would have to remain in force until North Korea had destroyed all of its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time in this regard and said, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must remain in force until a complete nuclear disarmament has occurred and confirmed.”
The Security Council unanimously increased trade bans with North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said success was achieved, but only a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal claims.”
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a missile zone and a nuclear power plant if the United States took “corresponding action.”
He said that Kim had told him that the “corresponding actions” he sought were the guarantees of security that Trump promised in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counteract the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the best universities in the world often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effects that sleep deprivation has on learning ability.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, “Why am I being told this first now, in my final year?”
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help learning ability and performance in sports and even promote general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding out that students were extremely sleepless over the week.
The course is an hour in length and includes various interactive projects.
In one section there is a picture of the room at home, where students click on coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen during lack of sleep, as well as the importance of good routine before bedtime.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
We know that this will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we think they have a right to know this, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that favors those who wake and learn all night is still present, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
The assurance of achieving enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in chemistry and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, who was one of the courses of the professor last year in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master's students to complete a similar course before starting their studies at the University.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to bed, and to wake them up, and keep in mind the harmful effects from blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, but it can confuse the internal clock of the body and lead to problems in falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrard's men
Rangers were still struggling in the open field as Stevens Gerrard's disjointed team had to settle for a 1-0 loss on Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox's team wanted to achieve its first win on the field after their victory at St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave his second loss in 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership league.
Menga scored seven minutes before the half and Rangers seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to level.
Rangers now drop to sixth place but Livingston goes up to third and are only after Hibernian in a boundary difference.
Rangers could face further trouble after the Calum Spence lineman had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown into him from the pitch-half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and made the semi-finals in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, continued with the same Livi 11 set-up that reached the level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well trained his team members rocked the resistance.
Rangers were perhaps more possession of the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the ball it achieved.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first pass from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's goal, but he shot a pass.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs ended up at Craig Halkett, but his defensive team Alan Lithgow shot past the draw.
Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than in faith in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morales felt he should have gotten a penalty when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, while the Colombian prosecutor dismissed the call.
Rangers only managed to take two shots to the mark in the first half but Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper of Ibrox, didn’t have much to do with defending the headers from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Liv's 34-minute chances had come even though the other team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, though only because of their perseverance.
Rangers again failed to do anything from the long free kick from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose to send to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took his advice in half and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Colibaly, and the switch was almost immediate when the backman came in, but Kelly reacted swiftly and ran forward to block the shot.
Still, Livingston continued to nause the visitors to play exactly the type of game they enjoy playing, and Lithgow and Halkett each achieved a long pass on each other's feet.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor did well to deny Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the finish line.
Rangers alternate Glenn Middleton wanted to get another hell when he and Jacobs fell down together, but Thomson dismissed it again.
Almanac: The Man Who invented the Geiger counter
Here's a page from our calendar "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today and onwards... this is the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called Geiger.
Geiger has gained a permanent place in the scientific world since then, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s measuring device, used to detect radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects from the atoms because of the radioactivity in the rocks.”
Evans: “It’s really going to crash now!”
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach your immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment
Treatment involves taking the patient's immune cells and changing them in a laboratory
Then they can “see” a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking the patient's immune cells and changing them in a laboratory so they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that the vaccine is extremely effective.”
HER2 “makes various types of cancer stop growing,” including breast, ovaries, lungs, and intestines, Professor Berzofsky said.
A similar method in which immune cells are taken from patients and those “teached” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a long speech in support of Trump and carried a MAGA cap after appearing in the TV show SNL.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was cast in a Saturday Night Live episode after a long speech, boasting Donald Trump to the United States and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, where he carried the Make America Great Cap, he long spoke against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
I've talked to so many white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I was worried about racism, I would have been away from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a trailer in which Hollywood star Matt Damon joked about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the long-term West was not broadcast, it was released on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not certain if Rock wanted to make fun of West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received a bad reception backstage due to his cap choice.
I was bullied in the back.
They said to me, "Don't go up the stage with this cap."
They bullied me!
Then they say I’m in a deep hole,” he said, according to a Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Would you like to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his superhero robe, “because that means you can’t command me to do so. Do you want the world to progress?
Test your love.”
His remarks were met with bale from the audience at least twice, and SNL's actors seemed shameful, according to Variety, and one of the presenters said to the newspaper, "There was a stone silence in the studio."
West had been invited to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West surprised many with his stage performance as he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chair of the conservative TPUSA, who said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU for showing MUM resistance.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being "himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his “art”) who I think supports and spread the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change name and feet in Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the music legend Prince the late late, who changed his name to a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Indictment for attempted murder after knife attack in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being stabbed in a Belfast restaurant on Tuesday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to attend the trial in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticises toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO series The Crownists.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stereotype of the masculine hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be hard on themselves to gain respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong views” on how to deal with this issue.
Personally, I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with the masculinity?
What have we taught men about the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to an extremely masculine character on television.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of our time – how do we change this?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other series after the show's similarity next summer, saying he had "enough of battlefields and horses."
As of November, Kit will be performing in a remake of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing in the Game of Crowns was meeting his wife, Rose.
I met my wife on these shows, so they gave me some of my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's mistress, as Kit in this Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV or with AIDS.
Health authorities say over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported just in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new infections were sexually transmitted, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the presence of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has fallen to almost zero, according to Chinese health workers at a conference in Yunnan Province.
The number of people infected with HIV or AIDS has, however, increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but widespread discrimination against LGBT people is still taking place.
Due to conservative values in the country, research has estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections occur as a result of inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised access for everyone to HIV medicines as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticised “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, MP Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff members had posted the personal information of three members of the Republican Party on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these claims came from “super-right-wing” extremists and websites.
Lies, lies and more miserable lies,” Waters said in a statement to Twitter.
The information published, according to the addresses and telephone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown source at Capitol Hill during an interrogation with the Senate on Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court judge, over allegations of sexual harassment.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState said that the IP addresses identifying the source of the information were connected to the Waters office and disclosed information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
This unsupported accusation is completely wrong and a lie,” Waters continued.
My employee - whose personal information and security are now at risk due to these false allegations - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unsupported accusation is a completely wrong and pure lie.”
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
It indicates that she has no mood to sit in parliament.
When someone is accused without a cause, one must not act in anger.
There can be no opposition.
One must not question the reasons for the accusations.
It must be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the Kavanaugh judge, who critics said seemed too angry at the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the mid-term election, also said his opinion on Twitter.
Great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed “the relevant authorities and law enforcement officers of these false statements.”
We will ensure that the guilty will be found,” she continued, “and that they will be prosecuted for all the acts that are damaging and dangerous to all my employees.”
Film Critics for Johnny English Strikes again - Spy movie with Rowan Atkinson turns out to be powerless
It has become a habit now to look for Brexit references in all new films where the UK is involved, and it seems to apply in this resuscitation of the Johnny English comic series - which started in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just woke up again in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this cannibal satire about how clearly miserable we are being a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether or not, the outstretched, gritted and clumsy Johnny English has been granted a second license to mess up everything - his name above all shows that he is a creation designed for an exhibition in other than English-speaking countries.
He is of course the wiser intelligence officer who pretends to have an enchanting charisma but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, a dass of Mr Bean, and a little splash of the man who played one night for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
He is also originally based on the tourist and the mysterious cosmopolitan who Atkinsons once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he left everything behind in chaos.
It’s one or two nice things in this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the helicopter blades shrouded in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comical skills, but humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially when more “serious” films such as James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer unstoppable jokes.
The joke seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and I found the fairy tale that Johnny English did not get into as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's silent comics in Mr. Bean's artificial.
The long-standing premise of the film is that Britain is in big trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into Britain's secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British spies, to a great deal of trouble for the spy on duty - but there Kevin Eldon unfortunately comes in too little role.
This is the final straw for the prime minister who is arrogant and controversial character and already in great straits due to enormous political dissatisfaction: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character to be reminded of Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for her.
Her consultants tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had settled on a sacred stone.
And here comes Johnny English himself, now headmaster at some fancy school, but also provides a secret teaching in how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers a spy school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets Bough, his former long-tired companion, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now married to a man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite shine.
The spy duo who messes up everything in her Majesty's service is now back in gear and meets high-stakes Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is impressed by the charm of the fascinating multi-millionaire within the technology sector, which claims to be able to solve the UK’s computer problem: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bough begin their crashing journey: they turn into a fancy French restaurant disguised as serving, they cause hustle when they smuggle themselves into Volta’s luxury yacht, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to study the infrastructure of Volta’s house.
There is nothing to save on that final point, but even though the film is playful and energetic, some of the children’s material in it is distilled in its entirety.
Medium material.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his abilities?
The Labour Party denies that it is creating a four-day work week for the UK, with the same salary as for a five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, now considers a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the party, the company wants companies to make use of the savings generated from the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit by getting one extra day off.
Employees may also enjoy a three-day weekend without a reduction in wages.
Sources say the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic plan and its policy of improving the interests of workers.
Trades Union Congress has supported the shortening of the working week for four days, as a means for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A source from the senior departments of the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review will be announced by the end of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that matches the approach of the party to change the economy for the benefit of workers and the overall industry policy of the party.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the objective is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “Four-day workweeks are not on the party’s policy sheet and the party is not considering implementing it.”
John McDonnell, Minister of Commerce of the Shadow Ministry, used the conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "unknown CEOs" and "profit collectors" of utility companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water-based companies may not get their full share back as the Labour government could impose “deductions” due to alleged wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers in corporate boards and create a joint ownership fund to give 10 percent of their private equity assets to their employees, which could get a 500-pound dividend from them annually in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds
The FBI investigation of allegations against a Brett Kavanaugh judge has caused at least a week’s delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that will be aired on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a journalist in the episode “60 Minutes” asked the Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
I said when the trial began, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the allegations were put forward and asked, “Did you do that?”
He was determined, steadfast, unequivocal.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immutable.
I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an incredible accusation to change that," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly refused,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And everyone she mentions in her name could not confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Civil Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will be held on Saturday in New York City. It is an annual music event in which a series of superstars will emerge and have a similar impact; ending poverty all over the world.
This is the seventh year that the International Civil Festival is being held and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to listen to music from, among others, Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the festival to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The 2012 International Civil Festival is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international campaign organization that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests had to complete a variety of tasks, or “actions”, such as working volunteering, sending an email to any of the world leaders, calling a phone call, or using other valid means to help draw attention to their goal of ending poverty.
But how much progress has the festival achieved, now that there are 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert in a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “click action” – where people feel they do something that matters by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says that these efforts have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements for its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main commitments comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executives in the UK working to “help children fully enjoy,” and promised to provide 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
With support from the UK government, donors, governments around the world and international citizens like you, we can leave the social injustices that malnutrition belongs to the past,” Tracey Ullmann, a member of The Power of Nutrition, told an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5000 appeals were sent about the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
On the list of frequently asked questions on the group's website, one question is: "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied, “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail constantly.
But, we will achieve our goal, just like the movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation ahead of us, because we are stronger together.
This year’s event will include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will take place in New York and will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy as a “barrier” to block Russia’s energy exports, says the Interior Minister
If necessary, Washington could use the navy to prevent Russia’s energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East,” U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially as the country works available to the legitimate government there, was a pretext to explore new markets.
I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy like in Eastern Europe and its south,” he said.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and methods to counter it.
The United States can use the navy to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to provide a barrier to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed a visitor gathering offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group calling itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He continued and compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and said it was more or less the same.
The economic alternative for Iran and Russia is more or less the exploitation of energy sources and to replace them with others,” he said, saying that Russia only has one card in the sleeve with an economy that would depend on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as a result of Trump’s commitment to increasing its exports of natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, public officials on the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to opt out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project to impose a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has often argued that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 power line, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the opinion that energy may not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose from suppliers,” Russia’s Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I don’t like the fact that external countries interfere in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, Chairman of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously” consider running for president in 2020, she says.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “consider seriously” running for president after the midterm election.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running for a city meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then they also need a woman as a leader," she told The Hill.
After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for President.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.
I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been uneasy about his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominated Supreme Court justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that “of course, we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place.”
A poll published on Thursday, however, shows that the majority of Warren voters do not think they should run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent more likely to vote in Massachusetts, according to a survey published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her availability.
The opinion poll showed more support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, where 38 percent said they supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent said they opposed it.
Other popular Democratic candidates for the 2020 presidential election included former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to a news release from Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at an election meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for one year after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel for other families affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and the mental wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at an election meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said her son and other war soldiers “would come back a little differently, they are hardened and wonder if any respect is paid to their fellow military and air forces and other military departments for the country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for trying to prevent the notification of domestic violence and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Washington city support a legal challenge against a new US policy that denies victims fleeing gang- or domestic violence for asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the city filed a court report on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, according to a news report from NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions the prosecution put forward by American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been given.
She said her spouse “and his violent son, who were gang members,” had abused her, but her application for asylum was rejected by U.S. government officials on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The prosecutors, supporting Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where the problems associated with gangs and domestic violence are increasingly growing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum policy revokes a ruling issued by the Immigration and Asylum Appeals Committee in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
President Karl Racine, the Washington State Prosecutor, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “missed more decades of federal and international law.”
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the Court of Justice said.
Lawyers further said in the report that the policy that refused immigration for admission was detrimental to the economy of the United States, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “grant important labor.”
Jeff Sessions, the Director of Public Prosecutions, ordered immigration officials to stop granting asylum to victims who fled domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Those who leave their home country for persecutions based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular community or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all problems, not even all serious problems, that people deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the number of dead is doubled
Conditions are becoming more and more difficult for those who survived.
There's a lot of excitement in the air," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the help center in the city of Palu.
Ambulances bring bodies here all the time.
There is little clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes and looking in their water-sitters to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals are overcrowded and damaged after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were favored outdoors due to continued intense post-tremor events.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the earthquake shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm pushing up to the wall ruins, I think," Haris told Associated Press, saying his family had been in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife call for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of “persecution” by “provocative advertising”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the US newspaper to discuss the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about the Chinese newspaper’s announcement in the newspaper Des Moines Register – which is the best-selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections that will take place on 6 November. China denies this accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. parliamentary elections marked what public officials told Reuters that a new level of military expansion was a new stage in a Washington-based campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to publish advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are in a ever-increasing trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say China’s tariffs in the early commercial war were designed to harm exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, which moves a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in his article in Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register that “China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the beloved free speech tradition of the United States and of our free press by publishing a cost-effective advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” he said.
On the other hand, few protest voices can be found in newspaper stalls on the streets of Beijing, and there can be no true reflection of the different views the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic policies, as the media is trapped under the heels of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China got away with the offer to publish” his article, but he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Experts warn that Republicans are making female voters distract them for the mid-term elections of the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a designated Supreme Court justice, who has been accused of sexual harassment.
Very strong emotions have been around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
It can’t be reversed with these things,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that last minute's Republican Senator Jeff Flake's call for investigation by the FBI would be enough to calm the angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November, said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesman for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to a Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November approaching!” as they protested in the Senate corridors, when the Republicans running the Appellate Committee decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
Voters’ interest and enthusiasm will go up in every direction,” said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news website.
People will say that the enthusiasm has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who don’t like the president, but rarely vote.”
The analysts predicted a backlash if the Republicans pushed to have Kavanaugh confirmed, even for Ford's testimony, as she expressed her accusations of sexual harassment from him.
This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Still, a former member of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be left on the bench, it’s also about how Republicans have handled it and how they’ve treated it,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to disagree with who to believe after the testimony from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a narrow majority supports the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believed the testimony from Ford, while 35 percent said they believed the testimony from Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or indeed lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a report from the Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Appeals Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh carried his genitals in front of her when they were both at a party that included students at Yale University in the nineties.
The man who invented the internet has plans to start a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is set to set up a start-up company to fight against Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology god, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid, Open Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
We have to do this now," he said of the start-up company.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own “personal data store online” or POD.
There you can find a list of contacts, to-do list, calendar, music library and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify being all present in one browser and all simultaneously.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is totally up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment by using data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrupt is the idea that the company provides resources, processes and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own independent apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete change that would put their current business model on the head overnight.
We do not ask for permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had the "important aim of creating energy in a business and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while establishing Inrupt.
I am fully optimized for the next era of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Won: Priest and Creator of the Victorian Cross from the First World War Honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victorian Cross during World War I as a soldier has been saluted in his hometown 100 years later.
On 29 September 1918, during the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt, Rev. Bernard Vann served as Lieutenant Colonel of the Army.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and he never got to know that he had been awarded the British Medal of Honor.
His two grandsons unveiled him in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “wonderfully symbolic” that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years ago from his grandfather’s honour.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, the Lieutenant Colonel Vann led the Canal de Saint-Quentin Canal, "through a very thick fog and under a heavy shoot from cannons and machine guns."
Later he ran to the line of shot and with "great courage" he led the line forward before attacking a cannon of one of his team and overpowering three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's exploits were "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “a great honor to participate in the parade” and added that “the deeds of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead got to see Gurru Pig
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be refused to see the main event.
The program included 13 major battles from San Jose, six of which were broadcast live throughout the UK's Channel 5 channel.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, exactly when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, the British audience received an unexpected turn when the broadcast changed to Gurru Pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the switch as “a kind of sick joke.”
According to official regulations, the content was not suitable for the audience at six in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s content,” said Dave Schwartz, marketing deputy director for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Puppies, yes.
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator said they would review their timetables and take the audience into account in the future.
I think when I think about the replay we could probably solve this," Coker said.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we can't solve this until on Sunday, which is Monday with them.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, a large number of text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t so, it was a public problem.
I promise it won’t happen the next time.
We limit the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and exceeded ourselves.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley "found powerlessness" due to sexual orientation
Olympic dipmer Tom Daley claims to have felt powerless against other people during his childhood due to his sexual orientation, but that he was encouraged to succeed.
24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realise that he was different from others until he went to high school.
In the radio show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that parenting has reduced his interest in winning the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular show manager, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was out of business on Laverne's first episode and said he thought he was a "smaller man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it wasn't agreed in society to be liked by both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, these feelings of feeling inferior and different have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation was finally discovered.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has made a huge difference as a supporter of the LGBT and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he would be heard because he thought he was lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope.”
The world champion triple said it had “surprised him” to fall in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
When a man goes through so much at a young age” – but he took part in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find peers who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple adopted a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his “every life view” had been akin.
If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
You know what, there are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son is baptized into the head of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit first.
I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breath stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
I just knew that I had dreamed of this my whole life, to dip in front of an audience at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left sitting on a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old rhythms again so that the record is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time, was left on the bench after the decision of captain Jim Furyk for the four-ball games and four-ball games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as it has been so many times before for the United States, the day of the five-time champion is divided between being a cheerleader and practicing the playoffs on the pitch in hopes of correcting what is up with him.
Mickelson, 48, was never the person who shot the targets with the driveers, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Golf Course, as long-range bunkers often penalize for bad shots.
Not only that the golf course is a huge challenge in itself, but Mickelson must compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood on a team and together they have won all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points below, take the first game of 12 monomer games, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say anything else.
He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and took care of me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and he has been so good for the teams before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go that way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in the number of players in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup that has never reached just as high as any other achievement on his record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence had a certain ambiguous impact on the team.
He’s funny, he’s ironic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
I think the younger players liked to tease him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain knows that a great advantage can disappear quickly
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good advantage for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward experience.
The Danes first played a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the side under the command of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the United States, but managed to squeeze forward a victory at the end with the lowest possible scoring difference, with a 141⁄2-131⁄2 win.
You keep reminding yourself that we had a huge advantage in Valderrama, we had a huge advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only rightly so,” Bjorn, who is seen here in the photo, after watching the 2018 cohort win 5-3 both on Friday and on Saturday and achieve the advantage of 10-6 at Le Golf National Stadium.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We're going to do everything tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not over until all levels are on the board.
We have our goal and it is trying to win this cup, we focus on it
I've always said this, I'm focused on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our opponents in the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn was very pleased with the way his players had performed on a difficult field and added: “I never get over myself in this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow it is the performance of the individuals that matters, and that's another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when one plays one is tried on all people’s skills as a golfer.
It is the message that needs to be sent to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he also has to play his best game himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will seek to perform better in individual games than with a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this big transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe performed “the miracle in Medinah.”
I remember every damn word,” he replied, asking how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had encouraged his players for the last day.
We need to play 12 important games tomorrow but one would like to start fast as happened in Brookline and Medinah.
When that landslide builds up, it causes a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We arranged our players accordingly and let them play like we think will be the best tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
I chose these players in this order because I think they’re all the way through,” Bjorn said of his choice of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new warship has been delayed yet again
The latest German Navy warships should have been constructed in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until next year due to malfunctioning systems and rising costs, according to local news.
The construction of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leadership ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class military ships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a source from a military spokesman who spoke to the Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to have been launched by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the planned project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are supposed to replace the Bremen-class warships, which have come to their years.
They should be equipped with a powerful cannon, multiple air and ship defense missiles and camouflage technologies such as reduced radar infrared, and acoustic signals.
Other important features are longer usage times – it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that these latest-type warships - which are said to enable Germany to demonstrate its strength at sea - will be obsolete when they are finally put into service, says Die Zeit.
The F125 made it to the news last year when the German army officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the navy has returned the ship back to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media spoke of a variety of serious "defects in software and hardware" that would make the warship useless if it were sent to war.
The faults in the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships will be managed by a crew of 120, half as small as Bremen-class warships.
It was also found that the ship was far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the navy to make additions to it in the future.
The 7000 tonne vessel “Rheinland-Pfalz” is thought to be twice as heavy as a vessel of a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
Apart from hardware defects, the cost of the entire project - including training on the journey - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said to have reached EUR 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), but was originally expected to be EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems that plague the latest ships are particularly important in view of the warnings that Germany's offshore dominance is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chief defence officer of the German Parliament, admitted that the navy was actually “expanding with a functioning ship.”
The representative said that the problem had snowed up over time, because older ships were taken out of service, but no ships replaced them.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class orders could be put into service by the Navy.
National Trust Nature Conservation Association spy on secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when they hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track different types of bats in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be installed at key points around the area to monitor the behaviour of the bats over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on patrols with handheld sensors.
Experts will analyse all recordings to find out the frequency of the callers released by the bats and what species do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of habitats are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of managing habitats, for example by creating meadows and how to best maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats has decreased significantly in the last century in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are at risk from construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitats.
Windmills and lights may also pose risks, including aeronautical paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, the ears are much more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching prey, because they are used to fishing at night.
They used advanced echo morphogenetic techniques to find insects and objects that are on their way.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization employs ten specialists, who regularly conduct observations, nesting checks and sometimes rescue operations.
It has even established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave ranch in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, manager of the ranch, says he is the perfect place for them.
The area here at Threave is great for bats,” he said.
We have old buildings, plenty of tall trees and lots of good habitats.
But there are still many unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and in other places will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasised the importance of observing bats before maintenance, as a possible accidental destruction of one nest can kill up to 400 female bats and young and completely eradicate all bats in the area.
Bats are protected and it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how well many of them are doing.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers prepare lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him of rape "false news" and says people want to "get their attention" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The striker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 afterwards for silence about the incident, according to Der Spiegel's news report on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, in an Instagram Live video with 142 million followers said they were “fake news.”
No, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is fake news,” the 5th world champion said to the camera.
These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
It wants to become famous by using my name, but it is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations they have called “an unacceptable disclosure of suspected privacy,” according to Reuters reports.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for “a perjury of the same amount as the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her in the anus, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell on his knees after a hectic incident and told her he was a "99 percent good man" who had fallen into temptation because of the "1 percent."
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex, but that it had the consent of both.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries taken in the hospital, but finally agreed to a reconciliation outside the courtroom because she was “deadly afraid of revenge” and worried about being “humiliated publicly.”
She says she wants to cancel the settlement because she is still in shock after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape took place, and this summer he crossed over to the Italian giant Juve with a €100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain would ‘be sorry forever’ for losing car manufacturers
Britain would “be sorry forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among Brexit car manufacturers, says Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “a concern” that Toyota UK would have told the BBC that if the UK would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop manufacturing at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact from delays at the border if Brexit without a deal would be a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other EU countries.
My opinion is that if the UK is driven out of the EU by the end of March, we will see production plants in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed concern over leaving the EU without any agreement on how international trade should take place, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say is supply chain risk if Brexit without a deal becomes reality.
Toyota's production line is based on the receipt of "last-minute", with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and the EU for cars produced after order.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry believes may lead to delays and shortage of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day-to-day warehouse in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers-plan for future relations with the EU “is targeted specifically to prevent these views at the border.”
We have to have a contract. We want to get the best deal that allows us not only to enjoy success in the present, but as an opportunity we can take advantage of,” he said in a BBC Radio 4.
The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we must be able to continue with a very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not predict how long its production would last, but warned that in the long run increased costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that his colleagues are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said: “We have submitted a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House declared on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “restricted by one week” now the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court judge, continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller’s work, a special prosecutor investigating Russian interference in elections, connections between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to the advancement of justice by the President.
For weeks, rumors have gone through Washington about whether Trump will run an Assistant Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had debated about carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility to roll the president out of office using an additional 25th article of the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday he visited the White House, including news that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump on Thursday, at which time he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “preferably not” wanted to run Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to be at the same time as being heard by the Senate Justice Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has sued him for sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further suspended the Senate’s vote.
Trump's media agent Sarah Sander was featured on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “It may not have been decided on a date for him this week. I believe it will be possible for him to be postponed for another week due to everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and it's always a pleasure to inform the media."
Some journalists disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The TV host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not a result of dissatisfaction with the fact that TV reporters had “virtualism,” but she said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they have virtualism.”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trump and the media would increase.
The president answers more questions than any other president has ever done,” she said, without referring to the source: “We’ve reviewed these numbers.”
Media meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s much better than talking to me.
We try to do a lot of it and you have seen us do a lot of it in the last few weeks and it will replace the press conference when it is possible to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
The president perhaps showed the reason in New York this week, when he demonstrated rampant and in times of strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Minister of Health writes EU health care workers in Scotland concerned about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU health workers working within the healthcare system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to declare their nation’s appreciation and wish it to continue to work after Brexit has gone through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter when there are less than six months until the UK exits the EU.
The Scottish government has already promised to meet the cost of EU-licensed applications for EU citizens working in the public service sector.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU for withdrawal have continued and decision-making is expected this autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations if there may not be a deal.
I know this has to be a great time of uncertainty for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to state again how much I value the work of all the staff, no matter what their nationality.
Partnerships from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and are beneficial to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for Tennessee State Tigers had to undergo an emergency surgery after receiving a head injury in a 31-27 defeat against the team Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a news report from Mike Organ, a news reporter from Tennessee.
Tennessee State chief officer Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was only about half over.
He came to the sidelines and fell down there,” Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before he was put on a bar and worn out for a closer examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told TV station Chris Harris that Abercrombie was having surgery at the hospital in Vanderbilt.
Harris added that there was “no information on the type or severity of the injury yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in the final year of school, plays his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before leaving, which increased his total tackle to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying real estate in the UK. The excess funds will be used to assist homeless people, according to a new plan by the Conservative Party
The action will make to no avail the campaign of Corbyn to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury plans to raise £120 million a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp fees when buying property in the UK. The excess funds will be used to assist homeless people. Theresa May will announce this today.
The action will be considered an attempt to nullify the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing high-income people further.
Individuals and companies, who do not pay taxes in the UK, have to pay higher stamp fees, and the excess will go into government action to assist homeless people.
The increase – which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase that was imposed two years ago on the extra home and property purchase for rent – could be up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that the increase will raise up to £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of New Build Properties in London are bought by non-residents, causing price increases and making it harder for those who want to buy real estate for the first time to enter the market.
Many of the most wealthy areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to cancel household quotas at an affordable price to fix the UK’s ‘housing shame’.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of notable improvements to housing issues, including rental controls and end-of-the-way exits from rental housing without any blame.
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “I said last year that I would devote myself to the restoration of my British dream during my first season – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our untapped real estate market.
The British doors will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for foreign parties as companies with headquarters abroad to buy homes as for the diligent British citizens.
For many, the dream of their own house has become far too distant, and the shame that comes with homelessness is still too real.”
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland.”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says it's his "main goal" to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scott now enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the North-East club, now ranked third in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I hurt my knee and that's it," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only be given if I did well to train a divisional team.”
Sunderland's predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a large club, but he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
This club is undoubtedly home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities,” he said.
It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I’d probably only consider myself happy here if I get the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into the next season's champion.
Ross claims to be more confident now than ever before during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real turning point,” he says about the season when he became Alloa’s coach.
I really believed that my coaching career suited me, even more than playing.
It sounds amazing, because I did well, I had a decent income from it and enjoyed a reasonable success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I still go through it in terms of stress and pressure from the job, but the coaching job seems simply right for me.
I always wanted to coach and now I do, I’ve never felt better about myself in all my adult life.”

The best time for beer is at 17.30 on Saturdays, according to a survey
This summer’s heatwave has proven to be profitable for British bars that are struggling, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July, while sales in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Advisory Company, who compiled the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and the unexpected success of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as June, when the bar sales increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent in June and deteriorated again in July.
Pubs and bars, mainly targeting the sale of drinks, did their best with a higher upswing while the restaurants went down.
Pubs that sold food also had difficulties in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the oscillation we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact from important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales in non-domestic markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still face difficulties, although a sales cut of 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful on top of continued pressures caused by costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for a restaurant, and only time will tell whether tempered temperatures, as we have had in August, will improve the situation.”
The total growth in sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the control company with sales in the British pub and restaurant sector, gathers and analyzes data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the sector.
One in five children have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years old, have secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey that included 20,000 students showed an increase in “artificial insta” pages
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “primary” account that they show their parents
One in five children, down to 11 years old, make secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey that covered 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “artificial insta” accounts – a reference to Instagram’s website.
The news has raised concerns about sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “primary” account to show their parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, found a teenager who urged others to "rape me."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Assembly of Private School principals (HMC), showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 years had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “There is a concern that so many teenagers are tempted to create an area on the internet where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "voice of athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive head of state at the Board’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful freelancer and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect in sports communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit a lot from getting her on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of athletes and hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, but now has four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was paralyzed after having had a short episode of hypovolemia.
He wrote on Twitter: “One month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time would tell if I recovered and then to what extent.
It’s been a tough job but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do some sports today!
Thank you for your encouragement!”
Breast pump ad, comparing mothers to cows, causes online disputes
A company that produces breast pumps is now referred to online because of advertising carried by lactating mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a well-known advertisement to mark the introduction of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be carried outside”. The advertisement is inspired by music videos and should show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are breastfeeding children.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with a layer of text like: “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see my tail” and “If you didn’t notice, these are not my udders, but my breasts.”
The song continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the cubs.”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the company's Facebook page, has caused a mention online.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received different responses from viewers, many of whom say that it has become a part of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
A really bad decision to use a cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, they need to be calf-filled and carry to produce milk, except that the calves are taken from them just a few days after they are born,” one of the comments said.
The Elvie Breast Pump fits comfortably in the Breastfeeding Holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another viewer wrote: “Understandably difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another added: “This ad is totally out of line with the time.”
Others came to the ad and one woman admitted that she thought the song was “funny.”
I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a great product,” wrote one of the viewers.
Another said: “This is a fun ad directed at mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the toilet) and feel like “cow.”
This is not an advertisement that compliments or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the advertisement, the women's group shows that they were all dancing with their breasts hidden in their bra.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is based on many women saying that they feel like cows when they pump milk out.
However, the Elvie pump is quite quiet, has no wires or pipes and fits comfortably on top of the bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and head of Mother, said: “Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a prominent presentation that would provoke publicity.
By imitating women with cows, we wanted to focus the spotlight on breastfeeding and all her challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time the Elvie Pump has been in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared in a fashion show for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp at the border with Texas
The number of immigrant children in detention has increased abruptly even though the number of people crossing the monthly border has remained roughly the same. Part of the reason is that the harsh rhetoric and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made it harder to get the children into temporary foster care.
In general, the foster parents have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared to put their chances of staying in the country in jeopardy, by volunteering to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that potential foster parents and other adults in the home would have to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, head of the Immigration and Customs Administration, testified in front of the Senate and said that his agency had arrested a number of people who applied to foster single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on criminal records.
Almost 80 per cent of those who are either foster parents or in a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are illegal immigrants on the criminal record.
That’s why we continue to look for those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children’s cases faster, representatives announced new rules that require some of the children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criterion, according to staff working in the refuges.
Many of them will attend a video conference, rather than in person, to argue their legal status before immigration judges.
Children who are declared unfit to enter the country are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent tendencies or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and reports published by the system over the past few months.
Speakers said these problems were even more likely in a larger institution as in Tornillo, as it is likely that no one will notice even if a child has difficulties, because of how many they are.
They added that the transfer of children to the camp without giving enough time to prepare them mentally or greeting friends could add to the shock that many of them already struggle with.
Syria says the United States, France and Turkey are withdrawing immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech at the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of vice-president, said foreign forces were illegal in Syria, under the false pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that “they will be treated accordingly.”
They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions,” he told parliament.
Moualem firmly argued that “the war on terrorism was almost over” in Syria, where over 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian areas” from both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreign sources.”
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, most of which train and advise both Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 troops in this war-torn country.
With regard to refugee issues, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed “some western countries” for “spreading out undue fear” that urged refugees to stay away.
We have called on international community and humanitarian organizations to make their return easier,” he said.
They create politics from something that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funding for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN envoys say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a neutral zone in the last major resistance stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack from the Syrian troops reinforced by Russia, on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, emphasised that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, who have links with Al Qaeda, and that “they would be eliminated.”
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to come to the first meetings with a new committee, consisting of members of the government and opposition, to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pay the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to “exceeding the provisions of the current government,” and warned against all interventions.
Reasons why Trump will win another election season
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless charges and scandals put an end to his presidential career, as many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would be undoubtedly “the most dramatic ending of presidential career ever!”
At the moment, the audience does not wear any wear marks.
Since 2014, the outlook for the best time has more than doubled to 1.05 million for CNN, and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, an increase from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s episode “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the audience with up to 3.5 million viewers on critical news evenings.
It’s a fire that people are attracted to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, ABC drama director for Designated Survivor, said of a government employee who becomes president after the House of Commons is completely destroyed in an attack.

She remembers a trip to a taxi in Boston for the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scowell.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
However, unlike what is shown on television, Washington’s stories could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privilege can afford to stop watching.
And yet this is more than being an informed citizen when one looks at the sixth hour of a group of experts, Bob Woodward’s use of “very intimate” sources for his book “Fear,” or the 15,000-dollar ostriches jacket worn by Paul Manafort (“a garment lined with arrogance,” Washington Post) and Stormy Daniel’s detailed biographies at Mr. Trump.
I will at least never look Super Mario the same again.
Part of what he does and makes you feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the show “Pawn Stars”, as he discussed the turnover in Trump’s show and daily changes in the plot (e.g., starting a fight with N.F.L. and complimenting Kim Jong-Un).

When I reached out to Mr. Fleiss, there was a 26 degree heat and sunshine outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while recording CNN.
He could not break out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were creating all these crazy things in the old days and people said, “This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.

Money on the outside overflows in the nearest elections of the mid-term
It is not surprising that the 17th polling area of Pennsylvania sees the money flowing towards it, thanks to the reorganization of polling areas, which led to two representatives competing for the same place.
The newly reorganized Pittsburgh area sends forward Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his place in the second electoral district in a special summer.
Lamb is running against another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now a representative of the old 12th electoral district in Pennsylvania, who has a lot of overlap with the new 17th electoral district.
The maps of the electoral districts were reorganized after Pennsylvania's Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized in favor of the Republican Party and that it violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th electoral region has been the start of a contest in funding campaigns between the main funding partners of both parties, the Democratic Electoral Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Electoral Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a special election in March for the 18th electoral district in Pennsylvania, but many followed that election.
The Republicans had previously defended that place for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the presidential election with a 20-point difference.
Political experts have given the Democrats a bit of advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but withdrew.
The diplomats noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s president Juan Carlos Varadero in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the co-owners drove out the Trump Group’s management team.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back the U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on “the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement early this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The penalties, which were proposed and included a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As inside meetings continued, the US and Central American representatives suspended a conference on security and economic success and were to follow up on a similar meeting held last year and was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent people from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September representatives from the top ranks made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending all speculations about penalties against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now to address the conference, which will take place in mid-October, as a symbol of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the diplomats said.
The three US diplomats also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss further the discussions the three US representatives described, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the insider debates against being allowed to remain anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the Board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.

The next scandal could be Mr. Mueller's report on the possible actions of Mr. Trump to obstruct justice, which has many public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign has cooperated with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress will be governed by another party, Trump may have to take responsibility for it, as soon as he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps a jury appointed to his peers.
However, these are very uncertain and I do not want to state that Trump’s fall is unequivocal, nor is his colleague’s fall in Europe.
We all need to choose, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight will be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to seize Hitler's power, only if Western countries had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We missed it and missed the chance to avoid the subsequent disaster years.
The story revolves around such important points and accelerates or delays the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The United States is faced with several such important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs the Rod Rosenstein State Prosecutor, the man who rules Mr. Mueller’s fate?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested making covert recordings by the president and discussing whether he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the news from the Times is not correct.
How will we respond if the newly requested investigation by the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed as a Supreme Court justice despite likely allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress in the mid-term that will make Mr. Trump shoulder responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to exhaust a long winter.
But I believe we will not fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government as before to sit in my ambassador's residence.
She survived, moved to the United States and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hacker cross.
With such a legacy, how can I do anything but look positively to our future?”

Graham Dorrans, team member of Rangers, optimistic for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory against the Austrians will bring them to a strong position to get up from the G-group of the Europa League. Rangers made an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to the knee prevented the central midfielder Graham Dorans from playing his first game of the season until in the game against Villareal who ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes Rangers can take advantage of the results as a springboard for better results.
It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team," Dorans, 31, said.
We started the game with the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
Maybe we could have squeezed forward a victory in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the Europa League.
Hopefully we can reach three levels but it will be a tough game because they went well in their last game. But with the audience who support us, I’m sure we will survive this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the spot.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last season behind us and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing retirement savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey, said they spoke to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would discuss this with their children.
People want a family member to take care of it, but it doesn’t take the right steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, senior vice president of the National Life Insurance Department.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your partner and kids: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t give them your wishes in good time.
Talk to your consultants and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change much in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your own money – as long as you own it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a responsible person for your health care so that you can nominate someone you trust to manage your health care and ensure that health care professionals comply with your wishes if you can’t tell them directly about yourself.
Also consider getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is heading to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Provide this information in a written plan so that you are ready.
It’s not just about money, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready.”
Man shot with a gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot many times with an air gun when he was on his way home on foot after having been out having fun.
The victim is a man in his 50s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Representatives describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30am local time, as a “random attack.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not injured and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the number of the dead is expected to rise.
Since all communication lies down, assistants have not been able to provide any information from Donggala county, which is an area north of the Pala and lies closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Over 16,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Palu after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palau and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated number of inhabitants was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is a administrative area under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, most of them in Morowali, which is on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Floods have hit the Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian disaster facility.
In 1938, more than 200 people died when a tsunami hit and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
A tsunami hit West Donggala in 1996, where nine people were killed.
Indonesia sits on the active volcanic ring of the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes are regular.
Here are the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra occurred on December 26, triggering a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes crossed the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people are killed on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on Richter struck southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on Richter struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter swept over one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 meters high tsunami that destroyed a number of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people remembered the destruction of the deadly earthquakes and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was formed this time, but over 100 people lost their lives as buildings collapsed.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the island of Lombok in Indonesia and over 500 people were killed, mainly on the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and presidential candidate, has been arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29, and from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence for attempting to prevent domestic violence and resist arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, published on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is held at the Mat-Su station where he is awaiting hearing in court, and he is held against a $500 bail, according to a news report from KTUU.
He could be sentenced on Saturday, where he declared that he was “not guilty, definitely” when he was asked to declare a fine or innocence, according to the news station.
Palin is charged with three offenses in category A, which means he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year and had to pay a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with offenses of category B, which is punishable by a single day in prison and a 2000-dollar fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is now being processed for the surrenderary court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for preventing domestic violence, and for carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed to have punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of surrendering soldiers in 2016 after teaching post-traumatic stress disorder about her son’s violent behavior, after his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Richter triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the centre of Sulawesi Island, north of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show when the incident happened are now on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Prosecutors face rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want the death penalty over Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of having participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violating federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, is believed to have taken a Home Depot truck on rent to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan. He drove down there walking and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims “intentionally” and caused serious body injuries “intentionally,” according to the statement of intent to apply the death penalty, which was recorded in the South District Court in New York.
Both of these charges can lead to a possible death penalty, according to the legal document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov's federal court charged 22 counts, including eight charges for murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with violent crime and for destroying a car.
The attack included a “substantial plan,” accusers said, describing Sapiov’s actions as “horrible, cruel, and unethical.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffered injuries, injuries and loss for Diego Enrique Angelini’s family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the southern part of New York took over the death penalty case for treatment.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a New York court in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The couple were both killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the detective that he was feeling good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea for the attack after watching videos from ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has declared his innocence in all 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders of Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a life imprisonment fine without the possibility of parole will only extend the setback for this event to all concerned,” said Patton.
Saipov’s defenders had previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
The Conservative MP says that Nigel Farage should lead negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the army of the people” today at a conference of conservatives.
This former leader of Ukip said politicians had to “feel pressure” from skeptics about the EU, while one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told the campaign in Birmingham that Britain “would be out” now if Mr. Farage were the Brexit leader.
But the challenge May faces in settling for a deep dispute between her own team members was even better revealed by conservatives who want to stay in the EU, taking part in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers on track and is under criticism from those who favor Brexit, those who oppose it, and the EU.
The Allies stated that she will continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – and force those who oppose Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and “entropy”.
Mr. Bone told Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to “get rid of the Chequers plan”.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to take part and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he were in control, we’d be out now,” he said.
The Senator from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in World War II to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out that the public’s opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wants to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative Brexit supporter, was also on the protest march and told reporters: “I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It is unpopular among our party members and activists who are on the streets and prefer us.
Please stop with the Chequers program and start listening.”
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they stick to their promises.”
Mr. Farage said the politicians would have to “feel pressure” if they were to evade the decision that was made in the wake of the 2016 vote.
It's about trust between us - the people - and our political parties," he said.
They want to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about to defraud Brexit, feel pressured.
We mobilize a civilized army in this country that won Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour demonstration in the city center.
A small group of activists waved the Conservatives’ flags against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Lord Adonis, from the Labour Party, made fun of conservatives for the security issues raised in the party’s phone program when the conference was opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems in order and all technologies for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
This is a complete scandal.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren is going to “think seriously” about running for president.
U.S. Congressman Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider a serious candidacy for the presidency” after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has repeatedly criticised the US President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke this afternoon on Saturday was her 36th meeting in the form of a citizen meeting with the residents of her constituency, since Trump took office.
One of the guests at the meeting asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to go to Washington and track our government, and then also need a woman as a leader.”
Captured after a fatal shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot dead on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who was seen on the recording.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near Southern University campus early Friday.
Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and died from it,” said Sheriff Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to a news report from 247sports.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the ground, using weapons in his possession, and admitted to having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and detained by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two meters tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting lineup last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scored 5.6 points and reached 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat after the orders of their team.
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas reached a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton at the start of Saturday, that Mercedes' orders would play a big part in the competition.
Bottas got a good start in the startup and left Hamilton almost as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to fight against his teammate.
Vettel went first to the pit and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been possible to make a final decision.
The Mercedes went into the pit one round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton got out of a narrow conflict where a Ferrari driver was forced to leave behind on the inner side after risking to remain behind after a third turn's defensive attempt.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the competition as he delayed the replacement of tires to try to finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen and reach fourth place.
He finally went to the pit in the 44th round but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me go.
The team has done a great job to achieve this," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because of her claims that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not directly discuss the testimony from Ford before the Senate ruling committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “bad and cruel and untruthful.”
The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see your anger, when you see people angry and cruel and untruthful," he said.
When you see the impressions and leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you finish this?
Do you remember her response... did you finish the document - "Oh, huh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't finish it."
Wait a minute.
Let's go... No, we're not going to go," he said, mimicking the Senate senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the allegations were made by Ford against Kavanaugh, and were leaked in early September. Feinstein denied the leak had come from her office.
I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t finish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I did as she asked me.
But her denial didn’t seem to go well down to the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe it didn’t work out, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and expressed that Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations.
They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods are required.
You see the cruelty, the malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control,” the president said.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars added for their loss on Friday in the Elite League league against Belfast Giants, by defeating the next match after, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got an early two-point advantage after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were fined for the locals but Dwyer then came Giants back over.
Francois Bouchard equated for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third defeat in the season for Adam Keefe in the elite League, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth game between the teams during the season, and the Giants had won the three games before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3.35, after support from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with support when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then much about being in the first minutes and Sullivan brought the locals back to the game when the clock showed 13.10, and Cownie then smoothed off after an assists from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer made sure to bring Giants over half time when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first third of the game.
The home team came together and Bouchard levelled back to the finish line when they were one man on the 27th minute of the second quarter.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together and helped Nielsen bring Dundee over for the first time in the game in the late second quarter and he secured his team a victory with the fifth goal when half of the last third of the game had passed.
Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, receive Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on an airplane escape from an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he was killed in ensuring that an aircraft with hundreds of passengers could take off intact.
Over 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a large earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a flood wave.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite his colleagues fleeing the control tower that swung at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake hit, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
A spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to news reports from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
We are deeply saddened to hear that,” he added.
Authorities fear that the number of deaths could exceed a thousand, as the country’s disaster facility says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
It is believed that the number of deaths is still rising because many bodies are still under ruins and cannot be reached,” said Sutapo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesperson.
Up to six meters high waves have caused massive destruction in Palu, where mass funerals will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger planes work to bring help and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There is little clean water.
Small markets have been robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to find survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the emigration.
Are you ready?" she told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says she is missing only after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline, which owned an aircraft that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says that one person is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from the afternoon of Saturday it did not know about the fate of one male passenger.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger’s details, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as she tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Representatives said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact order of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon a short distance before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway too far.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the approach had been extremely low.
It was really good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to wade the waist deep and get to emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the flight crews were scared and shouting, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen, who were working near the dock, also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people to ashore, before the plane sank to about 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Agency shows that 111 people have died in a PNG-registered aircraft crash in the last two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the night that a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors finished their case on Saturday in a reopening case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in court for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used mobile files to piece together the trips of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett claimed to have received location data from several mobile devices showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to a news report from The Clarion Ledger.
When evidence showed that his cell phone was at Chamber while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was "a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
It was another inconsistency that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile data showed that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls and her contact information from her phone.
He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defenders are scheduled to deliver their final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be presented to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
Hipp bounce trio wants to fight against negative opinion against the music genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that hip hop has moved away from its origins as it contained a political message and dealt with social issues.
They will seek the origin again and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen the recent boom in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A nanny in New York sues a married couple for expulsion after a “prejudice” text message
A nanny in New York sues a married couple for illegal expulsion after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple refuses to be prejudiced and resembles the prosecution of “blackmail.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she found out that her new foster-mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and said that their former foster-father, who was black, had done a bad job, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a news report from the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants to receive compensation for the expulsion, in the amount of $350 per day for the six-month job she had initially been hired to, even though no agreement was signed.
I wanted to show them that this is not what you should do,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have protested against the allegations that they are prejudiced and say that it was the right thing to run Maurice because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to say.
She is not prejudiced.
We’re not prejudiced people,” husband Joel Plasco told Post.
But who would entrust their children to someone after showing them their rudeness, even if it was a surprise?
Your newborn child?
Come on.
Plasco compared the prosecution to “blackmail,” and said his wife had been on her way for seven months and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Are you going to attack anyone in this situation?
It’s not very nice,” said Plasco, who works in the investment sector.
The case is still up for trial, but the public has been harsh about the couple on social media and shamed for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would find it difficult to like a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the footsteps of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny now that we know of the huge success of Paddington."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had accepted the rejection of his work with a calm positive attitude, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "sweetening" after his death last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, she described as “a very important family member,” she added that her father had been quietly proud of his success in the end.
He was a very quiet man and he was not used to bragging," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you have a child who achieves something, you are proud of it even if you didn’t really do it yourself.
I think he has somehow seen the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was a creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington credit to himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was extremely bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, ‘Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were gradually losing their activity and being eliminated from the body.
She had died a short time ago and this was her body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t pee or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to be in control.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned for her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew none of the difficulties she experienced.
No one knew anything,” she said.
I was dripping my head and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy with Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Suffering women hang up messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women, who had loved ones who committed suicide, are now trying to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a bridge message in Wales, with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I need to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 and lives in Lydney and said her son had been a successful cook with a contagious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room.”
He stopped working before he died because he was “sucked into a very dark place.”
In 2014, at the age of 11, Tyler's brother found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be a after effect.”
Mrs. Davis created the message “to let people know that they can go and talk to others, even a friend.”
Don’t sit down and say nothing – you need to talk to someone.”
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn’t say anything about him feeling bad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was at his worst on Christmas - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a shock to them, but that they had to work themselves out of it: “This rips a hole in the family.
This will tear us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaughs hanging on to a vein that the FBI has its investigation
I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study of limited time and scope - maybe we could get some kind of harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would "break apart" in the middle of a dispute between the parties where everything was in the backlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their reluctance is due to their timing.
The mid-term elections are in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans, as expected, seriously weaken their efforts to get their man elected to sit in the country’s Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was secretary of state Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its investigation report?
A referendum will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break up the tie and confirm him as Supreme Court justice.
The number of North Korean refugees “reduced” under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has shrunk since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean MP.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted data from the South Korean Unification Council, saying 1127 people had fled last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border control between North Korea and China and higher charges charged by smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says over 30,000 North Korean residents have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most people flee to China, but it has the longest border border border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the well-regarded neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China sees refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have technically improved considerably in the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a debate mainly about delayed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they unanimously agreed to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s Foreign Minister, blamed the US trade ban on the lack of progress since then.
Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the safety of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in her speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "mother-sick" and says he is unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in parliament, called Brett Kavanaugh, the nominated Supreme Court Judge, “motherly ill” and said he was too moody to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words fall in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever died like this, she would have been called hysteria,” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate’s ruling committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied with a strong sense of accusations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and got a lump in his throat as he discussed his family and his school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him “a disgusting and organized genocide” which was organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not act in the Supreme Court, because he showed that he is biased towards the Democrats.
I think these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is incompetent to the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if the Democrats reach the majority in Congress.
I’ll say this: if he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, where he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the interrogation, Kavanaugh turned away from questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
This is no time for a motherly, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “much is that wonderful,” Pelosi said.
And women need to take advantage of it.
This is a true discourse, months and years of fury overflowing and it does not come from it without crying.
We cry when we get angry," she told me 45 years later.
I don’t think it’s uncommon, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was managing somewhere and said she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed a technique so when she was angry and started crying, she said to her interlocutor, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of a previous job I held in an office with men in the majority, where I began to cry out of fury that I couldn’t express, came an older woman and took in my chalk. She was a cold boss that I had always feared a bit and she pulled me into a stairwell.
Never let them see you cry,” she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and happy to have gotten in.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president, but she was a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an infidelity on board a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspil) and withdrew his supply back, Mrs. Schroeder felt, full of frustration, that there was no reason why she could not consider running for president herself.
It wasn’t a good decision,” she said, laughing at me 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone named it “The Snow Whites and the Seven Dwarves.”
Since the campaign was long gone, it was behind her for fundraising, so she vowed not to run for it unless she managed to collect $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1000 to men gave her just $250.
Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment towards the system, which made it so difficult to raise money and direct her gaze to voters instead of representatives, and anger into the gender discrimination – that she broke into tears.
I think I had a nervous breakdown,” said Mrs. Schroeder, referring to how the media reacted.
I guess Kleenex is my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my gravestone?
She was crying?
The reasons why a trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were defamatory, and although the war is far from over, a rift between the two countries could be favorable for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump shot the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing China's major exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs covering goods worth £200 billion (£150 billion), and taxing as much as half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has responded in the same currency every time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to respond to the U.S. tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economy will be spared any time soon.
To get Washington to retreat, claims must be waived, but it would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, China’s president to publicly bow out of the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing retains the right of the cards, pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation leading to an economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than the audience has previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher focused mainly on Asia at the New American Security Centre.
Syria “ready” for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for refugees to return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al Moualem spoke at the UN General Assembly and said the situation in the country was improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is stable and safer, thanks to success in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to establish normal circumstances by building up areas that were completely destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and employment.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six more million people still live in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe has won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the team of the United States with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its throne when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to conquer the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the competition, made his initial stroke in the water on the 16th hole, which is a par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brightly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the race started using its current format in 1979.
Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, who was at the bottom of the ranking of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last race for the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for the Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player in the competition with 25.5 career points.
I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas to have chosen me and believed in me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team, and it was my pleasure to be able to help,” said sentimental Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He holds out his countryman John Rahm torch, defeating the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a monologue on Sunday.
I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed with 13-21-3 in competitions for the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the pitch, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after disappointment with the performance of his team, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I take it off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll be back together, I'll work with PGA in the USA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we'll continue.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You have to take it off.
They played better than us.”
