Shouting at the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland has started well and shouts and calls in nature are starting to pull people around the world.
I need Iceland,” a woman in the big world says in an advertisement from the “Looks Like You Need Iceland” campaign on YouTube.
Another observer says he will preserve Iceland in his heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she must go to Iceland as soon as possible, provided her fiancée lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and therefore expects to have to wait another month.
Another observer asks if the route to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
It doesn’t matter if it comes from a different time zone.
Egill Þórðarson from Peel, an advertising agency, along with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the reception has exceeded expectations.
I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been successful but this new campaign has already hit a record.
Basically, this is about creating a PR-value, that is, getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world reaching a total of more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is valued at ISK 1.8 billion.
That's not bad."
The main market is the United States and the campaign has been very successful, although the US is not on its way to the country anytime soon.
According to Egill, market participants such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also welcomed Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there was a reaction from the exotic areas, such as India, which was not particularly suggested.
These ads have travelled far and wide than we expected,” says Egill, who has watched more than four million people on YouTube.
We couldn’t have asked for a better start.
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer of Morgunbladid, when he took pictures of advertisements entitled “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The shootings took place far and wide, such as at Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, Reynisfjara, at Skógafoss, at Sólheimajökull and in a cave at Hjörleifshöfði.
The directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson of Scots Productions and the cameraman Óttar Guðnason.
The roles in the film were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Icelanders were involved in the advertising, but at the same time as recording took place in the South was another group in the West and the West.
According to Egill, “Let It Out” is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the aim is for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
This is just the first phase of this work for Promote Iceland,” Egill says, adding that his collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been very successful.
It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to.”
Explosive Sand: Discuss the situation on the labour market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, will meet in Sprengisandur, which starts at 10 o'clock in the afternoon.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation in the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the transfer of jobs to land that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the meeting, but he will discuss his criticisms regarding pension funds' investments and proposes that the labour movement and employers will withdraw from the funds' boards in order to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
In addition, Ivar Ingimarsson, a tourist in East Iceland, and Arnheidur Jóhannsdóttir, Director of the Icelandic Marketing Office, will discuss the situation in rural tourism.
They will look ahead in the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a deceptive premonition of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10.
This is what it looks like today 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of any kind.
However, she won worldwide fame for her role as Amber in Clueless's 25-year film Clueless.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch, Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Not much has happened to her lately, but she was allowed to look over the road and comment on Clueless on Australian television.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
I must admit that I mostly built the character on girls I met in schools that weren’t good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was,” Donovan told Clueless.
I didn’t want to leave the police station after a night’s stay.
About fifty cases came on the table of the police in the capital area today and the police's diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from prison after having stayed there because of drunk driving.
The man did not want to go away after he was released and did not obey the instructions of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay at the police station because of his actions.
A man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of a burglary in a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene by two men in Breiðholt due to reports of assault.
A woman who was sitting at a grocery store in Kópavogur was also unable to pay for the bill after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
A theft of a car was also reported in the city centre this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a while and she was then taken free of charge.
The car has not been found.
The Dark Deeds - The Dark Deeds
The theory has taken flight on the Internet that a curse lies over the television show about the band, while actress Naya Rivera drowned in California recently, becoming the third lead actor in the series to die prematurely.
Glee is a popular show about singing, dancing and joy.
The series focused on the so-called joy band of teenagers in high school, their love and destiny.
It wasn’t always taken out with the suspense of being in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the shows seemed to be able to overcome every situation that arose in their lives.
But outside the location of the shooting, there has been a lot of disaster on the actors and employees of the show, so much so that theories have arisen that curses are on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera performed the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call his grandmother all.
After the season ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and divorced her.
However, Dorsey refused to make a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat in Lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and he was able to tell the police that he and his mother had gone swimming and then Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned himself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area reported that we were assuming that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially declared dead.
She is believed to have been exposed to heavy currents in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded by drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the angelic voice that played a key role in bringing the party to the forefront and respect.
Outside of the show, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013, his colleagues on the show felt enough, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and seemed to look to a better way.
Just two months after completing the treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banemin was a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was a will.
Moneith had been treated and his tolerance to intoxicating drugs had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his co-workers, but at the initiative of his accompanist, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue taking part in the show and dedicated it to the memory of Moneith and his character.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman on the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the League of Joy, until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in her Los Angeles home on suspicion of custody of child pornography.
In his house search, he found a huge amount of child pornography and the case was soon officially heard out.
It was clear that Salling had already been.
He was subsequently charged and convicted for his crimes.
He had four to seven years in prison and he would have to be on the list of sex offenders and seek treatment for child sexual immorality.
Before the judge had determined the penalty, Salling, then on bail, was found dead close to his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who passed away long before.
Jim Fuller was assistant director of the show.
He became a sleeper in 2013, only 41 years old.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not bear her sister's beautiful story, but she accused Robert of great control and degrading conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014 but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her beloved, saying that her mother and sister were responsible, among other things, for how things were arranged for her.
My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression.
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and aggression at the location of a shootout and of having an extremely high astrology.
Jesse Luken made a guest appearance on the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
She suffered in 2010 that misdemeanoured hackers made nude photos of her and posted on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner were both on the show and had a relationship outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to observe them grow and prosper.
It can also be done endlessly with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that never gets forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and of course the precious time they had with their parents.
I bought a boat in the 10th grade.
I don’t think there are many fishermen working in kindergartens in Iceland,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is engaged in coastal fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter.
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If well fished you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking a student loan.
The income also benefits me well in the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in recent summers.
Axel was the most recent dock in Tálknafjörður when a journalist spoke to him late at night at the beginning of the week.”
The winter I was in the tenth grade I took command rights for boats that are less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished primary school.
I have been fishing in my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann passed away a few years after I took over the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half of them, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer when I had finished fishing.
I had no debt at the end of my first summer.
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
I had already laid out and collected money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and I got my share.
I also put my money in my boat fund.”
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his parents are, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
I can fish here in the west because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I studied in these areas west of paddling with my dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the whole Westfjords.
Although I prefer to be in the west, I have also been around the Snæfellsnes peninsula and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but preferably a lumpfish,” says Axel, who always roars one fire early in the morning and sometimes says he talks to seagulls and sings for the sky, in solitude for hours on the sea.
The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.
I don’t want to be alone in a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid getting into danger, but there has been some weather, but there has never been a great risk,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sea sick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going at any given time.
In the coastal fishing industry, I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example, in the rental quota, when I’ve been fishing for a day and a half at sea.
The coastal fishing system says it is allowed to catch 770 kilos a day, which it finds inhibiting.
Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am allowed to fish only 12 days a month, during the four months that coastal fishing takes place, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on humans to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their own head.
The regional division is also due to me, and the fishing grounds should be well located,” says Axel, who mainly reduces cod from sea salts during his coastal fishing, but also only saith saithe and individual other species float along.
Axel works during the winter with the University of Núpur in Kópavogur.
I don’t think there are many fishermen who work in kindergartens in Iceland,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in kindergarten.
I am stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology studies will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future,” says Axel, who also has a long way to go in business studies.
An error in registration prevented the repatriation of the confectionery
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in Iceland caused that an individual, residing in Iceland, was not called back for sampling.
If you fill in the form in English, it is not required to register your ID number, as is the case in Icelandic.
This will be looked at this week,” says a specialist in the field of healthcare at the Directorate of Health.
Three domestic infections were reported in the virus department of the hospital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to Iceland on July 15, two days after the rules on the so-called repatriation technique came into force.
Those who were resident in Iceland are screened upon arrival in Iceland and then re-appointed for sampling four to five days later.
It was revealed in the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service that the applicant had, however, followed the old system.
The border sampling was negative and he was not called back to screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the Directorate of Health, told reporters that this is due to an error in the electronic registration form.
If you fill in the registration form in English, you are not required to enter a personal identification number as is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it was intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on the repatriation portal although they have filled the registration form in English, and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people back to sampling after they arrived in Iceland.
This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to draw their attention to the process.
The man is in isolation and six have been quarantined.
They all go to sampling but the two were beginning to show symptoms.
Infection tracking is now ongoing with the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly finished due to the two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis has shown that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have focused on Israel although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says there should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are currently 15 in isolation according to the website COVID. is.
135 people are in quarantine.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected in Iceland in recent days.
Of these, four are completely unrelated and have not yet found the source of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sporting event.
Infection tracking is still ongoing.
At the time of the quarantine, more than 30 people were sent to quarantine, but the number of quarantines was reduced to sixteen.
In total 34 people are quarantined due to the new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short period of time that infections are detected at sporting events, and this has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager at the Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police, says it is easy to do so, as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
We are constantly calling on all those who live here to maintain individual infection control.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules going on that need to be followed.
It is possible to hold events,” says Johann.
He says that infection can be prevented by maintaining an individual infection control system.
Rules and criteria are also under constant revision.
What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health are constantly appealing to people, is to consider these individual infection prevention measures.
Both at home and also at service companies.
People wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from going on,” says John.
We need to encourage people to continue on the good journey we were on, in order to sustain the progress we have achieved so far.”
40% of the victims of COVID-19 had type 2 diabetes.
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how hard her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was reported on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that it will only happen as soon as possible.
Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.
A new study conducted by the US government shows that nearly 40% of those with type 2 diabetes died as an underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage will increase to half.
A study by the U.S. Department of Disease Control (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the coronavirus in the period from February to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on CDC infectious diseases, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
It was hidden in the slow growth of Reuters that a survey was carried out, pointing out the responses from the 12 countries that corresponded to similar proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, are not yet beginning to report underlying diseases.
Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through like a powerful century,” said Elbert Huang, Director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of Latin American origin, which has also gotten worse out of the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for people with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease at bay with exercise, a healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to keep a routine.
In addition, high prices of insulin have forced some to continue to show up at work, thus risking exposure to the virus.
Reuters points out that the U.S. authorities were able to be aware of the dangers that those with type 2 diabetes might pose as a result of the virus.
As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease and in the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic, this group had a three-fold higher risk of having to be admitted to hospital.
When MERS was observed in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a Yale University scientist, says that because of the COVID-19 virus's long-lasting effects, the epidemic has been swept away by a number of previously unknown complications.
I fear that we will see a tsunami of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the international Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new studies suggest that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs already ill in many people with diabetes.
In diabetic patients, a high glucose-lipid ratio may induce a “cytokine storm”, as it is called when the immune system reacts too strongly and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
It’s all one big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
It's all related."
The news has been corrected.
We were invited to champagne, then they left the room.
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollison received the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was putting up in Paris.
We loved each other so it wasn’t complicated.
Atli Bollison never forgets it when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
I was very impressed with her.
It was only the radiation, but I also thought it was very cute.
And still thinks," he said.
He also remembers this, as his husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
I am always hearing this story.
Last weekend,” she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first sight.
I felt and felt so excited about Atli, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and I’m fascinated by it.”
Atli says that the couple emphasised the importance of going their own way.
We do not tie our bows to the same knots as our fellow men.
We avoid the routines we analyze around us.”
This is perhaps the reason why they took the talk from artist Ragnar Kjartansson, even though it would be quite unusual.
Our friend Kristín Anna will contact us and ask if we can come to the desert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar's wife, on Snaps.
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had desert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at an art exhibition he planned to set up in Palais de Tokyo in the fall.
He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from Western culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and dekadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in.
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was to show a young middle class couple making love in a minimalist room.
This is intercourse with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much even though they knew of him and he of them “but they knew us and felt we fit into this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise for people.
Maybe they felt they were not getting the right people, but people who were sexually masturbated from acting for others.”
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘We’re not just there for this?’
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team,” says Ásrún and Atli.
It’s about love and intimacy.
The scene was recorded in a fine apartment on Mýrargata.
There was a very small film crew; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and a couple.
After the recording had been turned on, all the room left to wait outside in the car except for Atli and Ásrún.
We didn’t decide how we should be.
We got some guidance, but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and Ásrún.
We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on a vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
When the cameraman Tommi looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," Atli said.
It’s as much about love and intimacy as it is about sex,” says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
Then she turns around and starts to think about it,” said Atli.
Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone that way, but then my dad texted me and said, “It’s nice to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo.”
And do you think the participation in the project has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with the related family,” says Ásrún and laughs.
Asrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
I found it hard not to be with you, but someone else,” she said, turning to her husband.
But it was nice to see this because it’s just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you see it with the other pieces, it’s really cool.
I was able to get away from it and I was just proud.
And there was the little pea in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with her second child when the pea was adopted.
It was just beautiful.
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in their love stories at Rás 1.
Swansea with victory in the first semi-final
Swansea won 1–0 against Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the team’s first match in the semi-finals of the match to get into the Premier League.
The game took place at Swansea, Wales.
The score in the half was 0–0.
Locals in Swansea got a penalty in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew broke the arc of the penalty point and let himself defend.
Just two minutes later, Rico Henry, Brentford's player, received a red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute, Swansea players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then summed up the penalty shoot by scoring a great goal and secured Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea therefore leads 1-0 in the duel, but the second match will take place next Wednesday in the world of Brentford.
Ambassadorless for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted to get an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador to Iceland.
Since Carol Van Voorst left the U.S. office at the end of April 2009, there has been no ambassador in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have received the Order of the Falcon.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the President's Office that she would not be honoured.
After she left Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor came to work, in September 2010.
Robert S. Connan was appointed ambassador, but he resigned.
At the time of his work, Louis Ariega had worked in the Foreign Service for decades.
He then retired in the autumn of 2013 and took office as Ambassador to Guatemala.
Then took another ambassador-free period.
Robert Barber was accepted by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, when no ambassador had ever been there for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and a short election fund for Barack Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as usual with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.
It took two years for the U.S. Congress to invite Jeffrey Ross Gunter to a meeting to ask him about his espouse and confirm that he is an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at the Thing he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who has died, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is a politically appointed, formerly a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is Donald Trump's enthusiastic supporter.
Gunter arrived in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in Iceland since early 2017 for two years and four months, which is the longest case in Iceland.
The reason is both how long Trump’s administration was appointing key officials as well as that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been delayed greatly, including confirming ambassadors in office.
Since 2009, Iceland has been free of ambassadors for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented construction on behalf of the Embassy, which recently opened a headquarters at Engteigur.
The construction is estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion people, while the thick safety walls surround the building, and bulletproof glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to be enough to fill the present ambassador with confidence because he is said to be afraid for his life and has wished to get armed guards.
Former IBV player was subjected to racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former IBV player, says he was racist when he was in Iceland and regretted coming to Iceland.
This is stated in an interview with Tony, who appeared on the Ugandan daily monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC, which plays in the top division of Uganda.
In an interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland, but he played with ÍBV, Valur and Sport in Iceland.
When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle like I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position, but he also had the shirt number that I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted,” says Tony, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Among other things, Tony is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players suffer when playing in Europe.
It happened once to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Then I heard about it, and then I asked my friend what it was about.
He then told me that my opponent dropped racist comments about me after I tackled him.”
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
He said he made the mistake he regrets the most.
Tonny had not been able to make it to Haugesund, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted,” says Tony, who hoped that if he had played well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He believes that the loan to Iceland made out of his dreams of becoming a major in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at the St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-cm-long black snake in the tonsils of a woman who was looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out with forceps.
A study found that this was a parasite.
CNN reports on this.
The woman had eaten sashimi a few days before, which are thin cuts of meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi settled in the West, the number of cases of parasites has increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to begin in Europe
Spain is now in focus in relation to concerns about the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe, where the government has taken action to curb the spread of the coronavirus epidemic again.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken steps to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone must quarantined upon returning from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travelling to Spain.
The number of infections is also increasing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance to curb the spread of the virus and to restore the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, but the global incidence of infections approaches 300 thousand per day, which includes the most infections in America and South Asia.
Worldwide, confirmed infections have reached 16 million, according to the count of the University of John Hopkins, and the number of deaths confirmed is 644 thousand.
Mosaic works made finally able to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Customs building in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
In it, people wear orange helmets.
There is also a large grave.
And more smaller trucks.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the pavement is good, and now many people stop and look at the artwork from millions of mosaic tiles — like they've never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least they don’t look at it.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of there were parking spaces that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to take care of their errands in the city center.
A lively and diverse public space” and “attractive city atmosphere” are the guiding principles of the remodeling of Tryggvagata that is now in progress.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow the mosaic work of Gerður Helgadóttir at the Toll House to enjoy a better view.
In front of the work there will be a square, and since the area is well suited to the sun, it is considered to be suitable as a residence area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the material can be better enjoyed than before on these 142 square meters surfaces.
In the area there will also be small "fog mists", a kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is being implemented together with Veitur Utilities.
The pipes of water, district heating and electricity supply will be renewed.
Many of them have reached their years, but the sewage pipes and cold water pipes are from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened at the end of construction, cars can drive around it again.
But it will be a one-way street and at the same time create a quiet and accessible space for walking.
According to the Customs Office, the building was first opened in 1971, and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the harbour damage reached through the house formed where a 250 square meter windowless wall surface appeared to the street.
The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative impact on the overall street picture, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to have a permanent work of art set up there.
During this time, a lot of words were uttered by Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaics in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was made to contact her first before deciding whether to enter into a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work had to mirror life at the harbour, as the harbour had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When talking to the artist, she immediately became enamored with such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, as she would work on the proposals abroad.
Made received the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she put forward some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
It was also requested to enter into an overall contract with her and the famous German art company, the brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had worked with them for a long time on setting up famous artworks around Europe.
Contracts were successful and Gerður worked on the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who then took care of the installation of the Customs House.
All the work was done exceptionally well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and by the Oidtmann brothers, says in the summary.
Since then, the weather has been very poor in Iceland.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was completed and installed in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the work was finished at the age of 47.
Preparing to move more institutions out to land
The Minister of Social Affairs, Ásmundur Einar Daðason, is calling for more public institutions to be exported to Iceland in the near future.
This is what the minister said in the episode Explosion Sand at Bylgjan for lunch.
Recently it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Authority will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur in the autumn.
Six fire experts work for the Institute, but none of them intend to follow the Institute north, and the National Association of Fire and Ambulance Transporters has criticized the migration.
I think we should take another step into this world.
I am preparing for further steps in this world.
More traffic,” Asmund said.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public employment to Iceland, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Authority,” said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other institutions that have been exported to Iceland and were important to communities in Iceland, such as the Food and Veterinary Authority’s move to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance in Skagaströnd.
All the main things from the second day of Championship
94. The Icelandic Championship in Free Sports ended today at Þórsvöllur in Akureyri.
Several tournaments were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was planned for women's bestsellers at Þórsvöllur, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put Iceland record in the bestsellers in 2014 which stood until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved the record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in fanaform for the past few years, but she has improved the Icelandic record for the rest of the summer.
Elizabeth Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a tournament record.
Her Icelandic record set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and it was therefore quite a bit from that point on.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best cast of the day but she improved her best performance with a cast of 50.18 meters.
In the men’s category, the FH-ing Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Iceland’s record holder, won a safe win but he threw 73.84 meters in his last throw and set a tournament record.
His Icelandic record in the article is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympiad and Iceland record holder in round-the-clock competition at Þórsvöllur yesterday, but today he competed in round-the-clock competition which is his main subject.
The Icelandic record of Guðni Vals is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured a win.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today but he had one valid throw, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Iceland's record holder, won the long jump competition with excellence, but Hafdís jumped 6.25 meters today, which is just under 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the 200 m women’s race, the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir, who was the most populous, came to the finish line in 24.04 seconds but her Icelandic record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 meter race and in a 4 x 100 meter relay and also in a 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200m race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Oliver Máni Samúelsson from Ármann.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn won gold in the 100m yesterday as well as in the 400m race.
No fine is given for a 27 million ISK Bitcoin harvest
The Internal Revenue Board has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed a fine for a person for undercounting his/her capital income resulting from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations had not provided clear arguments as to why it would be necessary to fine the person.
The ruling of the committee states that the Director of Tax Investigations considered the person to have submitted materially wrong tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have underestimated his financial income resulting from the sale of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin up to 27 million, either intentionally or by gross negligence.
The man was fined for his conduct.
The man refused it in a letter to the committee.
However, he managed to sell cryptocurrencies for 27 million in 2016.
It would have been acquired by burial in the years 2009 and 2010 when this had been both easy and gloomy with a normal household computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrencies, the tax implementation of such sales had been significantly unclear and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that citizens would be aware of such measures on the tax return.
He would not have avoided paying tax on the harvest and would have accounted for his property in a tax return as a deposit on a foreign exchange account.
He would have asked both the attorney general and the governor how this was done but without success.
He also believed that it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would have been in a worse position than others to study complex rules that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear opinion on.
The man thought it right that his taxes for these two income years would be re-determined, and the burden would be applied, but in other respects, no punishment would be made.
He also stressed that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in Iceland since 2012.
He never intended to escape his duties in an inappropriate manner.
The claim for a fine would be out of control and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjolf raises the question: “This man understands what football is”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been very impressed with people's teeth as well as his progress for the rest of the season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
There will be flashes in the line of fire tonight when they receive IA on live broadcast at Stöð 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a game ban for four reminders during the season and does not appear with a new haircut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
I don’t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better than trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every time, and if there was anyone going to match this game, I thought he would do it or create it,” said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max stand, when it came to Brynjólfur.
I want to be here for the people.
Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what position it is in.
He looks a bit to the left as he starts to feel like he’s playing, but he’s got a very free roll in the team,” Hjörvar Hafliðason said.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says that Brynjolfur is a real entertainer and is glad to have such a colorful man in the league: “No one disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun type and I love it with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
There is an incredible amount of people occupied by him, who tells me that this man understands what football is about.
I am an entertainer.
I want to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólfur, people are paying attention to what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius,” said Moni.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in contact with a few B-teams"
Tobias Thomsen, player of KR in the Pepsi Max division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish newspaper Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the period in his home country, but for that he first needs to cancel his contract with KR where the Danish department starts before that Icelandic chance.
The club knows I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding,” Tobias told Bold.
I have been in contact with a few B-level teams and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract at KR.
He also says that he probably has to take on a pay cut in Denmark.
Companies in Denmark have probably experienced more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.
Bicycle Whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Answers for herself now after coverage DV
For over a year, Bjartmar Leosson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name “wheel whisperer” for it.
Yesterday there was a lot of noise when you published a story about your relationship with Bjartmar.
Then DV referred to a discussion on the Facebook group of Vesturbær where it was revealed that Bjartmar spoke to the man at Austurvöllur and said the scooter could be stolen.
There was nothing left to read from the original writings of the electric scooter but that Bjartmar had stolen it.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the original news of the case is not clear at all for what was really going on yesterday at Austurvöllur.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of an electric scooter claim that these were indeed his electric scooters.
That information got the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be wrong says Bjartmar.
I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as there was information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and was searched for.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to punch on talking to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I’m doing very fine in this case, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away my word.”
Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police.
Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's get this straight.
Then the owner of the electric scooter proved ownership of the electric scooter and drove off.
Later, the right owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this more than a year of practice, Bjartmar says he can count the number of times he hit an edge with people on one hand's fingers.
I have had a peaceful relationship with Reykjavík’s toughest men,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, mentally disabled people and other people who for some reason are on the street.
The addiction is a hard master and the next dose needs to be financed, unfortunately theft of such liquidity is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
My relationship with these people is really so good that I have a lot of good people on my side.
There have been cases of people going into treatment and getting on and then looking for me and helping me do what I’m doing,” he said.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is polite.
Some people know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully in order to show him receipts, e-bike numbers and so on.
Bike theft is a big problem that has not been addressed.
Moreover, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point out that people are talking to him on stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar does not like the previous news coverage of DV and does not claim to be some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is not on the ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so.
Of course the police should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are simply not doing this.
For example, I have watched policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.
She’s absolutely out of control in these matters.”
When the cops aren’t doing anything about it, and it’s just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this issue, then why not?” asked Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen bikes, that sometimes he stumbles upon his “clients” on the street that they just had the right Brighter bikes they had previously recovered from.
The time that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police has happened that she simply does not show up.
It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame,” Bjartmar said.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
In many places, stories of people can be found thanking Bjartmar for having taken their belongings back to them.
Bjartmar says he has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run in millions, if not millions.
Weighing there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works day-to-day at kindergarten and every other weekend he works together.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a major year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, admittedly, received pensions from the Danish king all the way from the 19th century, but in 1919, a pension fund was established for officials, which eventually became the pension fund for all civil servants.
The basis for the current pension funds of general wage earners was then laid by collective wage agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.
The pension system of wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th century labour movement brought forward with its wage struggle.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in a historical strike in 1955, and the organization gradually received its demands for sick leave and sickness benefits, significant vacation rights, shortening working hours, improvements in housing and more.
All these rights cost great and strict struggles, but were, in retrospect, much more and more permanent than the increase in the amount of money in the payroll, which disappeared as hard as the temperature of the inflation that marked the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The preparation for the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would actually be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members on an equal basis.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for the majority of employees on the board of directors of the funds was often discussed by the employees’ associations, but it never reached its conclusion, and therefore we still have the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund members are not in the majority on the board of the funds.
Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on Compulsory Insurance of Pension Rights and the Activities of Pension Funds addresses the investment policy of the funds.
Paragraph 1 states that “a pension fund shall have the best interests of its members in mind.”
Paragraph 5 also states: “A pension fund shall set itself an ethical standard in investment.”
The Shareholders' Policy of the Icelandic Pension Fund includes, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned provisions:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.
This is how the interests of investors and the goals of society are combined in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, in particular those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy on: to maintain good corporate governance of employee benefits social responsibility and environmental issues.
The pension fund Gildi, which has the largest funds in the country, has adopted a "Guaranteed Investment Policy" which contains provisions of a similar nature.
This is all recalled here as the introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is used in the case, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but I think the following definition now appears to be "most widely taken": Shadow management is when a head of a union says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the union to the board of pension funds recommendations or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they do not comply with the recommendation, they will be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.
If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not “shadow management” however, as such communication between humans is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I'll let the reader think about which way he feels "dark."
In particular, there are two men who have tried to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
It is a journalist Hörður Ægisson and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.
The occasion for both events arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants, and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Chamber of Commerce, then sent the recommendation to the company's representative on the board of directors of the Icelandic Chamber of Commerce not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be let out.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and Ragnar Þór followed the same path with his recommendations that were of course based on Bogi's decision.
Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to assert the matter in Fréttablaðið's Friday newspaper with large words about shadow management, law violations and a great need for amendments to the law.
There, a small culprit was indeed to ponder a heavy load, even though the blessed culprit had been in a conjugal manner and was quickly wiped out.
Since the issue is important, let’s consider the topic itself at the end.
I explained before that the issues in the Act on Pension Funds pertaining to this matter.
It means that fund directors are required to protect the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investment, and these issues are further elaborated in the Articles of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Storers, as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a dangerous policy and it is not necessary to look for examples of this in the past, since large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair’s CEO was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw himself and pulled it back.
Time will tell whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to fund members at the time of settlement.

One of the infected people did not have a repatriation check.
One of the three people diagnosed with COVID-19 in Iceland yesterday came to Iceland from the Baltic States on July 15th, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic citizen who does not normally live in Iceland and therefore did not receive clear instructions to use the so-called repatriation techniques after arriving in Iceland and undergo another sampling a few days after arriving.
He got a negative from screening at the border.
But he’s in Icelandic society and he’s actually supposed to go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in Epidemiology at the Directorate of Health and an assistant nurse at the Directorate of Health while he’s on holiday, in an interview with the newspaper today.
He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample.
She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his network in Iceland that he should have used it Icelandic.
However, he did not realize this.
When the ID number is not registered, you need to apply for it yourself to come to the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this is the right way,” Kamilla said.
Thus, it is clear that we need to strengthen the information on this while we find some way to make an automatic evangelization system even though Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to somehow make it more obvious who is involved in the Icelandic society in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, however, few people visit the country even though they are defined as participating in Icelandic society, the current Icelander.
Only six people have been sent to quarantine since he was diagnosed yesterday and all six were in contact with him.
They will be tested, but two of them are beginning to show signs of COVID-19 infection.
The man got a negative from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says it is likely that he has recently been infected with the virus that it has not yet been able to be detected in the virus when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man has been infected in Iceland but does not carry the virus with him to Iceland.
It is not entirely possible to argue that this is definitely an imported infection because it has been a long time since he came to the country that he may have been exposed here like these two that have caused a little stir in relation to the sporting events.”
She says it's very unlikely because of the small number of people living here.
In fact, it is very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but states that it cannot be ruled out until an Icelandic genetic diagnosis has been made.
If we get a virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that it has been carried to Iceland.
Pepper spray and bombs applied against protesters
There was a clash between the police and the protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray and non-lethal grenades, but the protesters broke windows and lit up.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racism were widely protested in the United States last night, but the Seattle protests were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful demonstrations.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city’s courthouse.
In the wake of the protests, the police said they were riotous, and there was a conflict between the groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was killed by police last August, was remembered by the protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of National Guard officers gathered and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman murdered by police at her home in March.
The group carried a firearm and walked in the ranks to a closed intersection where police separated the group from the group of people who protested and also carried a firearm.
75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man murdered by a white bartender in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Manchester United manager, does not want to overstate the importance of Leicester today in the final round of the Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against the Wolves, Solskjaer and his men finish in 5th place and thereby miss the Champions League.
However, they would still hope to join the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
We're not at the end.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we haven’t had a bad season,” Solskjaer said.
But no matter what happens, this is not the end of our journey, because we still have a lot to do with the two teams above us,” Solskjaer said.
It is clear that the nerves of people will be stretched at 15 today, but Solskjaer tried to pretend that each other game was a match.
If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and on this the company builds.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s our turn to take advantage of it,” Solskjaer said.
This is not the most important game of the season, it is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period.”
The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger mentally than last season,” Solskjaer said.
65,000 infections per 24 hours
Sixty-five,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
A total of 900 people died from the virus yesterday, and the last four days up to that time, there were more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 on August 15th.
Fear of the Second Wave
The Spanish government is now trying to keep the spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in the last 24 hours since the beginning of May, and the news arrives at the same time as Spain begins to lift one of the strictest exit bans in Europe.
The reintroduction resulted in the British authorities now obliging passengers arriving from Spain to quarantine upon their return home.
A week before, Spain was on the UK’s list of safe countries.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where the government has resorted to broader restrictions to try to stem the growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks, and geriatric centers will be closed at midnight.
There is now a withdrawal ban for 200 thousand inhabitants of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain's decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is poorly played after the pandemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, cancelled all flights planned to Spain and the Canary Islands today.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the pandemic, but there seems to be little interest in resorting to an extensive curfew that has devastated the economy.
For example, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken extreme care of such things as the nuclear weapons he does not want to use.
France’s Prime Minister Jean Castex has also said that the nation “would not survive economically or socially,” if a national curfew would be imposed again.
Many leaders hope that local resources covering the residents of individual towns, cities or regions will be enough to restrain the virus in the next round if it comes to that.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic
Three domestic infections were reported yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Five individuals with a positive COVID-19 infection were diagnosed in Iceland yesterday.
According to the press release, one of the infections is linked to the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen people who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social activities of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, only part of the sports team in quarantine.
Others who were sent in quarantine are connected to the person in another way.
The origin of this infection is unfounded and the infection tracking is in full swing by the National Commissioner's infection tracking team.
ReyCUP tournament organisers have followed the guidelines and rules of the Chief Epidemiologist and Civil Protection Officer that are still in force and the appropriate measures have been taken.
However, the photos of the tournament attracted a lot of attention, as it could be seen in a very close community to celebrate the good progress of its team on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the organisers posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
Note: Parents please respect the rules that apply to students themselves at the school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for your understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but it is related to the infection that was reported the other day.
According to the report, “Icelandic genetic analysis has analyzed the infection and a new type of virus has been identified that has not been diagnosed here before.”
Work is also being carried out on tracing this case and the person is infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, 15 July.
He was diagnosed on the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six people who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border and further investigations are waiting for results, as is the case in a cross-border process.
Finally, the announcement states: The Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health urges people to take care of and pay close attention to individual infection prevention.
If there is little doubt as to whether the symptoms of the COVID-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to undergo a biopsy at the nearest clinic.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked during the shopping weekend - directs guests other
The camp site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to a report from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Named West Village Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes at Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalundur and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
It is enough to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, as in previous years, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentary films will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a tradition in the city.
Due to the demand for the camp site, you can expect a good turnout this year, if the weather does not put a line in your account, but DV told you earlier today about a secondary forecast.
We can expect the worst weather in the south, and hope for Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodation in the town was already fully booked.
Entire apartment building rots down to the best location in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunhaga 18-20.
In the meantime, owners are seeking building permits for renovations, but their errands have been around in the system for the third year.
One of Reykjavík’s oldest, most lush and expensive neighborhoods is a beautiful apartment house on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the building are the doors of two stairwells, each of which contains four fairly spacious apartments.
They range between 93 and 130 square meters, though most are over 100.
The house has a great history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, the Studio, the Dairy Company, Jóa, a fish shop, and most recently the University Print.
The house has, in a mild way, remembered its dandelion more beautiful.
The house is now under a lot of damage, as can be seen in the attached pictures.
The owner of the building is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the Register of Companies, among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús was the owner of Borgun and was the head of the holding company Borgun.
In the group of owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or no maintenance since then.
Neighbours say that the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily since, although most recently in years.
On the Facebook page of the neighborhood residents say that the house was “not particularly lively last year”.
There you can play in that the owners have for a few years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in good condition for a long time.
It's time to do something good about this spot and it's sad that it's drawn like this.
He also says that he is upset with the owners of the house for not running to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house, and stopping this "laws plugin".
Do this only in consultation with the surrounding community so that it can be done quickly and completed.
The ‘Law Tap’ to which the resident refers is the organisational process of the block that has been in progress at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Appeals Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee rejected it as it did not have a basis for a regional plan and the surrounding area presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík started with a plan and completed it with an advertisement in July last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, it was almost three years since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the building at the beginning.
During this time, the house had drifted down considerably and the neighbors began to get tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house out into the situation and the reaction of the neighbors were the answers in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others did not at all.
Others turned their anger at the city, others did not.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was a problem, but neighbors have used unused parking in Dunhaga 18-20 for their vehicles.
One complainant in the case said tired of the administration:
The fact that we have to go through the process three times is unbelievable.
It's like the city of Reykjavík can't read."
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city’s soaring administration and noble intentions of the owner and the years of their work that is now in its inception.
When a journalist arrived at Dunhagi 18, he was greeted with a gallop of doors and rubbish.
A Playstation computer and a recent television lay among other debris on the planet — victims of Icelandic summer wet.
It was open to the old office of the University of Iceland and a lot of cats to judge.
It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stems of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which are probably meant to be a book, are faced with.
The staircases of the apartment were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was lucky enough to meet the people of one of them.
The Romanians were cooking their potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist in.
The Romanians work for the temporary work agency Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for a while, imitating DV's evidence that the company has paid nothing for the building except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not suitable to charge rent.
On the grounds of mail in the lobby of the house it is clear that there have been many foreign workers there in the last few years.
The operation of temporary work agencies has not been part of the COVID-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been most efficient in using the services of temporary work agencies.
Nevertheless, the residents of Dunhagi 18 seemed to have plenty to do, and the worksuits and mittens hung in the joint until dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the building, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When the journalist said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, he suddenly became ironic: At the best point in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters is the property of the decommissioned.
The owners want to change the house for the better, and the neighbors want to improve the condition but share the definition of "improved".
In between, the city's planning department sits on a starting line, a victim of endless appeals and appeals opportunities in the planning process and a suspension of the Appeals Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
In the house there are Romanian workers, perhaps even those who go into improving the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekend newspaper DV on 17 July.
In a campaign against obesity in the wake of a coronavirus pandemic
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will provide £10 million in a campaign against overweight, which will include a ban on fast-track advertising, after he became seriously ill, partly because of his weight.
It is planned that Johnson will present the campaign, which has received the title Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their clients to overweight, and will also be embarked on a campaign to increase the number of cycling paths.
In addition, advertising fast food spots on television will be banned before 21 in the evening, according to British media sources.
COVID-19 has raised us against the short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use our time to become healthier, more active and eat healthy food,” a government spokesperson said.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he got infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and it is partly because of his weight that he is considered to have become so seriously ill.
Women are better suited to lead the changes
She said that the new constitution is the biggest step that the nation can take towards greater decentralization, transparency and anti-corruption and the interests of the whole.
We need to change gear a little now and who is better suited to lead such a change than the group of society that is more easily to be in these values.
There are women,” said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity with women.
To stand together and be united in leading change.
It’s time for us to make those changes.”
She said she was a bit concerned about the emphasis in Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
We’re not ready to see what needs to be done.
As the Germans are very aware of their own history and view all that needs to be done.
It's lots.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We don't have the same rules here," said Helga.
Asked, she said that women are in many ways in good cases in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders live with very masculine values.
She said that politics, for example, was about their own interests, control and power, as if they were the forces that perpetuated inequality in all societies.
Women have now formed this group and come together and are just a little annoyed at the fact that the parliament is planning to try to ignore this 2012 referendum,” she said.
It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
Based on human rights and nature, cooperation and that we are all really at the same table,” she said, adding that the above values were the basis of the new constitution.
We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It’s ridiculous, we can change things differently,” said Helga.
It’s ridiculous that there is a law of nature that women’s jobs are always paid less.
It’s ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses have to face wage struggles just to get decent wages.”

Trying to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two people were arrested.
Then the police stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlíðar, where the driver was at 146 km/h at a speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had in the evening enough to turn around and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise from the parties.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven noise levels were received, which was considered a major issue in the police’s diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise issues were reported by police.
Six people were taken to jail last night.
Police were called at the farm last night when the parties fired fireworks.
They were already there when police arrived.
Nine drivers were stopped for intoxication or drug use.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the center of the city last night, one of whom was saved in a prison cell.
Two people were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their face, one in the city centre and the other in the west.
One person was transported to the accident department after he was injured jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who pulled a caravan at Kjalarnes yesterday.
The bicycle equipment of the caravan was, according to the police diary, in a "very bad condition" and it was grounded.
You can stay in Monet's house during the shopping weekend
The house, where Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his life, is now on the Airbnb site.
The next free night in the house is the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, they must rent at least two nights.
Based on Airbnb’s page, it’s next available in a week, on Sunday of the shopping weekend, and therefore it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to book a painter’s house.
The two nights over a trading weekend cost only 964 US dollars, or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kronur as the newspaper comes next.
Dozens in quarantine and several of them begin to show signs of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected individuals are unrelated.
Tens of people have been quarantined for this reason and a few of them have begun to show signs of the disease caused by the virus.
Three people were diagnosed with the coronavirus in Iceland yesterday and two at border screening.
A specialist at the Directorate of Health says that the increasing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading to other parts of the community.
The first domestic infection has been sequenced and there is a virus that has not been seen here before so we have no particular reason to think it has gone hidden in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in Iceland, but of course we need to be very careful now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, specialist at the Directorate of Health.
Most of them have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will be carried out in the near future, but some, who were in contact with the infected, have begun to show signs of the coronavirus.
Now there is no influenza going on and less about other respiratory infections, so we can be pretty liberal by doing these tests on individuals who at the time of the influenza had found reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infection tracking is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more people need to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending sporting events.
It has raised questions as to whether it is appropriate to hold such events.
The communications manager says it's easy as long as people follow the guidelines and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible that the infected people were infected at the sporting events.
If there are no more isolations from these individuals after having been in contact with them at these sports tournaments, we can claim that our infection prevention measures at the tournaments have worked.
But it's not clear," Kamilla said.
The Department of Civil Protection's procedures are under constant review.
We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary,” Kamilla said.
In less than a week, the number limit will be extended to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect relaxation.
Special meditation to cook" - See Elsa Viðar's menu
Elisa Viðarsdóttir is a footballer and plays with Valur.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
It takes a lot of energy for the day and usually takes time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts with going to work at eight,” says Elisha.
After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the kindergarten around three o'clock.
Elsa is very nourishing to pick up her daughter early in kindergarten.
It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After exercise, it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to empty our minds.”
Elsa does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her master's thesis in nutrition and knows what is right for her to eat to have enough energy to do her work, school, family and exercises.
What is right for me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I find it important to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritional or nutritionally deficient.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Elsa is very interested in cooking.
I feel a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen cooking and getting it very much into it.
I have to say that my confidence is with me in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, lay in almond milk overnight.
Make this meal so with what you have.
Most often it is banana and crispy muesli & coffee.
I am a great coffee lady.
Intermediate: Incredibly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flatbread, clean skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon up from a box if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of high-food salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafelballs, rucola, oven-baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit of what I’m working with.
If the layout is completely out of control (which happens often), then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, no more laying on you.
Intermediate: Bring me some carbohydrate rich for exercise, bread with toppings, breakfast cereals or fruits.
Dinner: Fish will be very often chosen in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Conflicts between Police and Protesters in Seattle
Seattle city authorities in Washington state have declared a state of insurrection following numerous protests in the city center.
Police seized a bomb and pepper spray yesterday to try to clear a large area of land occupied by protesters and stretched over many blocks in the vicinity of the city’s parliament.
The police announced on Twitter that at least 11 protesters had been arrested and that there was an investigation into a sabotage carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police said the protesters had stoned the police with stones, bottles, detonators and other loose shells, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were made.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The protesters in Portland, Oregon were urged to show solidarity, but in the city there has been frequent conflict between the protesters and the heavily armed forces of the FBI.
There, as in other cities of the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests systematic racism in American society and demands remedial action.
Do not withdraw until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether Icelandair's flight attendants, due to take effect at the end of the month, will be withdrawn.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Company on behalf of the flight attendants at Icelandair will close at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says that it is confident that Icelandair will not decide on the cancellations until the result of the vote has been announced.
It’s very close,” says Linney.
No layoffs have been withdrawn, this must be made available in such a way that the machines can be manned.
Of course, people are impatient to know if they will have a job at the end of the month.”
The contract was signed a week ago, on the night of 19 July.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on a contract that the flight attendants had previously incorporated into a vote.
On July 17th, the Board of Directors and the Trust Council of the Icelandic Flight Attendant Company agreed to announce a general work stoppage at Icelandair, the members approved it in a vote.
This was never the case, but it was decided in the wake of Icelandair's decision to cancel discussions with the airline, cancel all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company’s pilots were also supposed to take on the work of safety personnel on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
People are injured after the operation of Icelandair, when all of the company’s flight attendants were laid off and announced that an agreement would be reached with another union.
It is now clear whether this will have an impact,” she said.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, when 900 of them were terminated by 95%.
Their notice period is variable, for those who have the shortest working life, it is three months and ends at the end of July-August.
That group includes 90% of Icelandair’s flight attendants.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
Then we ask for continued discussions with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair’s requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants have gone too far."
Voting on collective bargaining ends and Icelandair announces the results of the second quarter tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new collective agreement will close at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s financial results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company’s revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the collective bargaining agreement between Icelandair and the Icelandic Kennel Club began on Wednesday, July 22nd, and concludes tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who are allowed to vote on the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new collective agreement on Sunday 19 July, but on Friday Icelandair had ended discussions with the company after the flight attendants rejected the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had also told all flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new collective agreement was signed.
According to a new collective agreement, flight attendants need to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until 2025, where the provisions of pilots and flight attendants have been integrated on how long a flight can take on one shift.
The agreement was presented to the FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel on Monday, and many flight attendants who spoke to them about their dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most people, however, agreed that the agreement had to be approved to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair's financial results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating results for financial items and taxes, according to preliminary results, is negative by USD 100 to 110 million or by ISK 15 billion.
Icelandair submitted preliminary calculations last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue was about $60 million during the quarter, or about ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also plans to tender the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair plans to conclude agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before the stock offering is due to take place.
New varieties rather than a new type of virus
A new virus just means that it was a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been simmering in Iceland,” says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at the Department of Disease Control at the Landspítali University Hospital, who reports that “a new type of virus” has been diagnosed in Iceland.
Three domestic infections were reported yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup, but the origin of the infection is unknown and the infection tracing is ongoing.
In addition, infection was diagnosed in a person who arrived in Iceland on July 15, and two who were in contact with him started showing symptoms of COVID-19.
The infection was diagnosed yesterday related to the infection that was reported in the previous day and after sequencing at the Icelandic Genetics, a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before was identified.
Infection tracking is completed in connection with that infection.
It should be noted that this is not a new virus, but is the same virus that has spread throughout the world, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about another wave of the epidemic has started, Már says that as if there were a single case, and it could go on so that nothing more could be done about it.
However, if there are domestic cases that do not have ties from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then that conclusion could be drawn [by the second wave] but it is premature at this time,” explains Már.
Happy in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hidden in the hot tubs?
BBC programmers lead the way in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s pool and hot tub culture.
The Icelandic bath culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that there are nowhere else in the world as many bathing places per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal energy is the foundation of it, but also the tradition of swimming here.
Children’s swimming lessons were compulsory in 1940, but older citizens are no less efficient at using hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as a permanent part of the country’s general well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class and status.
Free of mobile phones, people talk on a personal note around the world and space, or enjoy the palliative power of the water: meditates and recharges the batteries of the soul and body.
To get 100 days in the election
A hundred days remain until the U.S. marches to elect a president for a four-year term.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he's got a steep pick-up.
Joe Biden, the upcoming Democratic candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump at national level, taking into account the polls.
According to a new survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's reaction to the pandemic is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has been in a bad economic situation.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim to support Trump’s response due to the pandemic and 48 percent say he kept a successful economy.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to average FiveThirtyEight, Biden’s track is 49.9 percent nationwide but Trump’s track is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to move attention from his performance to the epidemic to Biden, promoting so-called cultural disputes, and promoting policies aimed at law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy makes a huge effort to hold Trump's attention, and it is highly likely that he will win if the election is actually about how Trump has done his job in the last four years.
Trump’s unpopularity also seems to be coming down on Republican MPs, fearing that Democrats could even reach a majority in the U.S. Congress, which has so far been considered a very high ranking.
Politico recently said that a party and a candidate would remain similar, and that is now the Republican Party would receive its highest abduction in decades.
In the 2016 parliamentary elections, the suburbs have been especially bad, and it is now clear that this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the suburban population to follow him, for example by saying that President Biden will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial divisions.
Trump has, among other things, repealed a regulation since Barack Obama’s time at the White House, designed to diversify the suburbs.
He also urged the “housewives” of a suburb of the United States to read an article by a former Deputy Governor-General of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the suburb of the United States and agreed with Trump.
Biden will ruin your neighborhood and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” the president said.
The population of the suburbs of the United States is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to NPR, about half of all voters in the United States are.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney won the majority of the votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite the fact that Trump secured a small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his presence there has fallen sharply.
Although there is a difference between the surveys, Biden has recommended a 15-percent lead on Trump in the suburbs recently.
Regis Philbin has died.
Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, programmer, promoter, and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for directing the popular live chat series with Regis from 1988 to 2011 along with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has also directed episodes such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been on most hours on American television and he has received recognition for this.
He won six Emmy Awards in his lifetime and was nominated 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media in the last 24 hours.
Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have hitherto been planned, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” referring to a global coronavirus pandemic that the world is going through together.
Professionals have an additional year to prepare and Japan’s authorities improve their costs due to the delay.
Everyone keeps their heads at stake, though.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would become the venue for the Olympic Games this year, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 games, but this was the lowest-ranking event for Rio in Brazil.
This time the city of Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.
The Games were scheduled to take place from July 24th to August 9th but have been postponed for a year and will start on July 23rd, 2021 and end on August 8th.
If they fail to hold the games, if the coronavirus remains too high a threat, the games will be canceled.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top the last game.
The choice of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the city's presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation is – the more likely it will be to receive the honed.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympic Games, worth more than ISK 20 billion.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion ISK on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean considering how much it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums and generally to strengthen the infrastructure of the country to handle such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Japan’s organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been going on these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
In a report from the National Audit Office in Japan, published at the end of last year, however, it emerged that the cost was closer to double.
It is likely that the cost of delaying the games will not be fully assessed, but it has been estimated that it will cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run in the range of 15 to 30 billion dollars.
It is such a high figure that all tax revenues in the Icelandic state only sufficed for about half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists, who try to examine numbers and view the benefits and benefits of the games.
As a matter of fact, quite a lot of people seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less than so positive for the economies of cities that hold them.
Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs increases very much in the short term, but in the long term cities tend to be upbeat with low debt levels and high operating costs of small-use structures.
Rio in Brazil is in severe debt due to the 2016 games and has been struggling to maintain all the big sports structures built before the games.
Results from the 2012 London Games show that only 10 per cent of those who received Olympic jobs in the city were unemployed before.
This means that there was no new job except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not come out particularly well into the financial situation of hosting the Olympic Games due to the bleak costs associated with the structures built before the Games.
The benefits, however, are often considered to be the increase in the number of tourists who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is a lot of uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether the number of spectators normally attending the games will be accepted.
The main thing, however, is the honour chosen by the cities, but it is difficult to value for money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy the games bring is not such that it can be put on a price tag.
But even though the show is great and there is nowhere to be spared, it’s not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some elites, it is a surprise just to delay the games.
Australian five-thread woman and gold medalist, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, relieved and would have been far from a good joke this summer, but expects to be in the form of a competition for the 2021 games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire from the games this year, if they had been held on time, in some cases the suspension of the games means that they stop the competition before the games take place.
Trust your body simply not to go through years of rigorous exercises.
Few athletes made as much appearance in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympics as the acrobatic Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She plans to go to the 2021 games, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is in a higher order for a gymnast in the top row.
It’s a sensitive topic,” Biles says, but in another interview published on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page, Biles asked if she wanted to get as close as she did in Rio 2016.
I really don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year of practice,” Biles says.
She has previously mentioned that her body does not tolerate the stress that comes with gymnastics training for much longer.
Nevertheless, she practices vigorously for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop practicing suddenly when the pandemic was as high as the gymnasium was closed.
There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her olympic gold could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form certainly is a little better than for most people.
We have a tight schedule now.
It was hard to start practicing again after the gymnasium opened.
We started slowly, but we are on a full swing again and I will continue to expand my training as the year progresses.
Of course, we don’t know exactly how these games will be played or whether they will be held, but we still practice assuming they will be, can’t do otherwise.
I've put too much effort on myself to leave the sport now," Biles said.
With it, as with other blind doubts or perhaps more awareness, the situation can arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
To think about it is hopeless.
No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do except prepare for the Olympics considering that they will be held for a year.
Perhaps the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Delayed the wedding due to an epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
I think there are other important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
We really want to get married sometime and have a dream wedding and have all those present that are dear to us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what is important right now and that is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There are a lot of things going on and we should focus our attention on what is happening in the world.”
