The members of the assembly of Wales have expressed their concerns as “a puppeteers”.
Some members of the Assembly have expressed their satisfaction after having heard the suggestion of a change in their position as MWP (Claim member of parliament in Wales).
This idea was born after the development of plans to change the name of the Assembly of Wales.
The members of the policy committee are concerned about the good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour Party of the Assembly says that “the new name is expressed in English, with the words Twp and Ppp.
If you’re outside the city of Wales: English, the word tw means ‘nox’ and the word wp means ‘kaka’.
For her part, a Scotland Assembly member has said that the whole team is not very happy and has suggested that the names of the substitutes are not very satisfied.
Also, a member of the conservative party of Wales has said that the name is open for new ideas, but also for the rhythms that can lead to the swinging of the MWP.
In order to better understand this conflict, it is necessary to take into account that Wales's w lyrics and the English u in Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the Committee’s commission, which is creating a legal draft for change of names, said: “As far as members of the Assembly, they will have the sole responsibility of choosing the descriptive ones they want to use”.
According to the report of the Government of Wales 2017, the Welsh assembly has the potential to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to select suggested proposals and, in general, the Parliament of Wales received numerous declarations of solidarity.
In relation to the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name of the Members of the Welsh Parliament or the WMP (in English), but the MWP was decided in a public consultation.
The members of the Assembly suggest alternative options, but it may be difficult to choose an option, especially for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who had to send a draft over a few weeks with changes.
However, the legislation on the modifications to be made will affect the operation of the Assembly, among other things, the rules to avoid the loss of name of the members of the Assembly will be established and the design of the system will be managed with the help of that law.
When we discuss the legislative change, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make a decision on their names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters vote for Sunday and decide whether they will change the name of the country in the name of ‘Northern Republic’.
This popular vote has been organized to be able to solve the long story of the last few decades, with a province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor is a domination in its territory and has prevented the petition to enter the European Union and NATO.
The vice president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he will not see the vote if it is a opposed to plebiscite to change its name.
However, the referendum followers (including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say that the price to be paid to enter the EU and NATO is only valid.
The San Martín church bells lose their voice for the problems of the churches of Harlem
I have spoken to several people and long say you can find a bar and a church,” said Mr. Adams.
Today, again there is nothing”.
It says that it is normal for the disappearance of bars.
“People use other methods to socialize” it.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people were meeting”.
Regarding the Churches, the money obtained by the sale of assets will not be sufficient and we will be again at the starting point.
The churches can also be replaced with housing, and the sanctuaries of the neighbourhood will be constructed with people who care about their homes.
‘People who buy copyright homes will be white,’ and that’s why the churches will be closed up in full because this new people are not members of churches congregations.’
Two churches, which had been built by white people before a black Harlem metropolis, were built in 1870 and a decade later in San Martín.
In 1930, the original method of congregation was moved from the neighbourhood.
After that, a congregation of black people took the lead.
The black congregation of John Howard Johnson took the church of San Martin, Howard held a boycott against Harlem’s 125 commercial street shops which did not recruit or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church had several harms, but Johnson's parishes designed several plans to re-build the church and collect the carolina.
Robert David Johnson, son of Johnson and heir of San Martin, nicknamed the "the poor people's bells".
In July, the expert shot the chili in a different name: “The treasure of culture” and “the irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Experts, Tiffany Ng, University of Michigan, also noted that it has been the world's first black musician to have a career of 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether explains that San Martin does not replace his musician.
During the last months, San Martin has witnessed the nefarious displacements of several architects and contractors, some of them brought by secular leaders or by bishop-dresses.
On the other hand, the parish church council (coach of shepherds made up of secular leaders), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese to verify that the recruitment of these people will be “the costs generated”, because the parish church does not have anything to do with the architects and contractors sent.
Some churches have presented their complaints for the lack of transparency that the diocese has had.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old child while looking for oysters on the Californian coast
According to police, a 13-year-old shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on the California coast, on the first day of the oysteral.
The attack took place before 7 in the morning at the beach of Beacons.
According to Chad Hammel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV channel, he stayed with friends for half an hour on Saturday, but he was asked for help from a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel, who thought that he was screaming first, but later realized that the friend was ‘wowed me’.
They’ve done it, they’ve done it!
I could see his full circle” Hammel said after seeing his friend.
I cried out to all the people out of the water: there is a sham,” Hammel said.
The young man was taken to the hospital at San Diego's Rady children, and his condition is serious.
The species of shark that attacked it cannot be detected.
The captain of the Sorosle member, Larry Giles, presented a report against the media and said they had seen a shark a few weeks earlier, but the spice was not dangerous.
Also, Giles pointed out that the wounds of the victim lie at the top of the sound.
The police closes access to the beach of Ponta in Casablanca to carry out a 48-hour study and ensure the safety of the people.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The Sainsbury’s supermarket plans are included in the UK’s cosmetics market
The Sainsbury’s supermarket has intervened in the Boots, Superdrug and Debenham shops, and now offers a variety of expert and specialised staffs.
While fashion and domestic product sales are declining, 2.8 billion pounds have been invested in the UK's beauty sector, which is unprecedented and will be tested in 11 countries.
Investments in the field of beauty allow the supermarkets to take advantage of the sale of TVs, microwaves and household products.
According to Sainsbury’s supermarkets, it will double the range of beauty products and offer more than 3000 products, including Revlon, Essi, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawaw and similar brands to customers.
With regard to L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, there will be more space in the marked areas, like the areas that can be found in the Boots shops.
In addition, the supermarket once again presents its brand label “Boutique”, which is a fully-grown product which is more and more demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, the award offered by the freelance artist Fragrance Shop will be tested in two stores of the Sainsbury’s supermarkets, the first of which took place last week in Creydon (South London), while the second one will be in Selly Oaken ( Birmingham), will be opened at the end of the year.
Because online shopping and daily food trends are trendy in small local stores, supermarkets need to work on the head and ears to attract customers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury’s supermarkets, has said that the sales point will cover the style of major shops and will reduce the threat of the supermarket chains to offer more services and products that are not food.
The supermarket Sainsbury’s has opened the points of sale in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats, both strings after its purchase, which has reinforced the sale of food and the buy chains, which are now beneficial than ever before.
The supermarket tried to reopen the departments of beauty and medicine, but the strategy failed.
Later, she met Sainsbury’s Boots at the beginning of 2000, but this association was concluded that the winning process in supermarkets became a role.
A new strategy was organised when the supermarket Sainsbury’s sold its 281 store drug businesses to Celesio, who owned Lloyds Pharmacy for over 125 million years ago.
Lloyds will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a wide range of skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The commercial director of the supermarkets Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s, said: “We have improved the appearance of the beauty department so that our customers can find the perfect environment.
We have also hired experienced staff to provide detailed advice on the products.
We have designed our own range of brands to meet all your requirements, and thanks to the comfortable surroundings and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and simple option for those who use obsolete methods”.
Peter Jones is "restart" after the cancellation of the 11 million liberal bid by Hollywood Willoughby
The star of the Dragons Dean’s program Peter Jones went “restarted” because after leaving Hollywood Willoughby on a range of 11 million free TV shows related to the brand’s business, he wanted to pay full attention to new contracts with Marks and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the Benet brand that sells domestic products and components.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Platrow's Top brand.
The Morning program presenters used Instagram to present their resignation.
As a result of the resignation of Holly Willby to accept contracts offered by Mark & Spencer and ITV, the star of the program "Drawing both the high-profit company Peter Jones was greatly angry at the last time.
According to our sources, a meeting on Tuesday at Marlow’s main side was held, which led Jones to the discovery of the most famous female “harming” on our TV, which meant that he could not spend more time in the domestic and domestic products.
The business is compared to the Gwyneth Platrow brand and has doubled the 11 million liberated goods on Willby.
Willoughby indicated that he left the Brand business on Instagram to go to a holiday home in the United Kingdom.
A source said: “The choice has always been among the preferences of Hollywood.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us unanimously.
No one could believe what happened at the time when the brand was closed.
Even more, Marlow’s residential warehouse is full of products to be sold."
According to experts, the company is facing the disappearance of millions of liberal companies due to the fact that it is the most profitable presenter in the UK; the company has invested lots of money in several products (including cushions, candles, clothing, and home products) and the emerging delays.
In addition, this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have three sons and his wife, Tara Cap.
Willoughby and Capa founded the Truly brand in 2016 and entered Jones 52 as a director in March.
Both couples always organise their holidays together and have a 40 percent of the Baldwin TV producer.
Willoughby M&S will be ambassador of the brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program for ITV channel.
A fountain from the Jones group pointed out that "he didn't say anything about his business activities".
A hard talk, yes, but then we fall in love”
He talked about the wrong phrases he had to endure in his jokes about the unsuitable comment for the leader of North Korea.
Why did Trump’s President give so many things?
Trump uses his voice to answer in his chat “TV presenters”:
"I haven't given anything."
After holding the first meeting in Singapore in June, Kim said that she wanted to organize a second meeting and that led to an important step on the way to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has been stopped.
After the meeting and three months in June in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho, said to the UN leaders in the global assembly on Saturday, the North Korea has not seen a "requitable response" from the United States in terms of the steps taken on the course of nuclear disarmament by the country.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have been hardened to maintain the country pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic perspective and has indicated that in the final talk.
He said “our relations with North Korea are better than ever”.
In addition, we were about to declare war with the North Korea.”
Thousands of people could kill that war.
But now we have this exceptional relation between hands."
He also said that the efforts made to improve relations with Kim, among other things, have been completed, the trials with missiles have been improved, and the processes have been postponed to the rest of the U.S. military.
It also explains its unusual point of view in relation to the conversation with Kim.
”It’s very easy to work by the president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to join it in the country, we have 200 people here” said Trump said.
Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquakes destroy a island and let hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake, for example, the support of non-profit organisations for gaining international achievement was not necessary.
Although 10 percent of the population in Lombard were displaced, the earthquake did not consider it as a national disaster (this is a predisposition to the national support).
In some cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said it didn’t need international support, so this is a challenge” says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is already creating a group that will go to Plur, but it is not yet known that volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the national disaster agency, states that the official Indonesians are working to support the international agencies.
Although Indonesia has suffered several earthquakes, the country has subdivided measures to combat the natural rage.
The fortifications against Tsumien have been built in Ace, but there are still few fortresses on the coast.
Paul has not warned people of the siren and although there is a warning that perhaps so many people will die.
When it is good weather, travelling between islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Natural disasters also hinder the efforts of natural disasters.
There was a hospital vessel dedicated to treating the victims of the earthquake in Lombok and now it goes to Palau, although it will take three days to reach the point of catastrophe.
The gambling operator’s campaign focused on the improvement of the infrastructures in Indonesia and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and rails.
However, the funds have been reduced and the administration of the President of the game is in a narrow position while it prepares the elections to the next year.
Likewise, Mr. Gambling has problems in controlling the disputes of Indonation, for example most members of the Islamic Party have seen a more conservative point of religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands of houses have lost their struggles on the streets, including the threats, arcs, arrows and similar weapons.

The Cormwell State of Parliament becomes the final goal of the trend of “revitalizing history”
If it disappears, it will be a poetic justice: as the Talibans destroyed several religious objects, with several historical and cultural objects from the country that did the same.
However, the Cormwell association says that the suggestion of Mr Crick is “a mindless” and that he is trying to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, the representative of Cromwell, said: "The inevitable discussion arising from the removal of Oliver Cromwell's state outside the Westminster Palace has become an objective Cromwell.
Well, he never asked for or organized the icons of the civil war in England.
Maybe we would have to sacrifice another Cromwell for his forefathers, Thomas, for what he did in the preceding century.
The imaginary representation of the Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of our 19th century opinions and history; many people still believe that the actions of this person must be held.
Mr. Goldsmith said that The Telegraph was "less people than the 19th century think this, but still several people believe that Cromwell was a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in this case we are talking about monarchy.
The historical debate will continue if the representation of this person is accurate.
However, we can say safely that the conflict took place in the middle of the 17th century was the starting point for the development of our country, and the famous Cormwell was part of the parties that participated in it.
They can also be a reason to commemorate and commemorate all achievements earned by the title Lord Protector."
A pig killed by a Chinese farmers
A pig attacked a farmer and killed him in a south-west market of China, according to local media.
The man with the surname "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a cut-off artery in his blood and was dried up in a pigle from the Luian pine market in the province of Guizhou, as defined in the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the pigtail is prepared to insert piglets in Qinghai Province.
Usually, on Wednesday, Yunnan travels from the province with his cousin 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the dead body and he saw that the door of the neighbor was open.
He also stated that the blood in the pigtail was a large piglet in the mouth.
The report of the forensic analysis confirmed that the death of the farmer was raised in 550 lbs.
My cousin’s legs were full of blood and crippled in the Guiyang Evening News, whose surname "Wu".
According to the safety camera, Yuan can be seen in the market at 4:40 p.m. (m. on Thursday).
His body was found one hour later.
The man who killed the animal was not of Yuan, or of his cousin.
According to a central market's Evening News newspaper, the pig is locked to prevent further attacks and to stop the police from gathering witnessing to the place.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for her death.
Although rare, various attacks of pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig woman and her husband attacked the farm in Massachusetts and the man was severely wounded.
Ten years before, a small 1650 liberated pig in his tractors, the man's wife, to abdicate.
In 2012, the pigtails of a native Oregon had eated their body and, after that, a group of people from Manitoba were not a aggressive animals, but if they taste the blood can function as an “agent” in the CBC News.

They are like children and they have a lot of curiosity... they don’t want to hurt you.
Just to show respect," he said.
The small storms of the Rosa River leave rainforests in the south-west of the United States
According to the weather, Rosa is declining the waters of the northern coast of Mexico while she travels to cold waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain to the north of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
At 5:00 am in the morning, Rosa will create 85-hour winds, and will become in the 1st Category, according to the time of the East, on Sunday 385 miles from the southern tip of Mexico.
They are expected to go to the north of Rosa on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a lower pressure point is being created in the Pacific Ocean and will be east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja California will travel to the peninsula for tropical storm and lead to tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Also, on Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches in some places in Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity will be combined with the low pressure point and large rainwear will be generated in the days ahead in the southwestern part.
In local locations, 1-4 inches can be dangerous because they can lead to sudden floods, waste current and groundfalls in the desert.
The rains produced with high tropical humidity can leave for about 2-3 inches in specific times and places, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to gather 2-4 inches in the southwestern part of Arizona.
Because the tropical rains are variants, they can produce sudden floods and irritating conditions.
It is not recommended to go to the desert if the warning of a tropical storm has been given.
The rainforests can make the ravines violently and storm can lead to wind and dust.
Furthermore, as pressure falls, local rainforests will be on the southern coast of California.
Because of the rain, it is possible to collect a medium-inch water and produce minor waste currents and slips.
This can be the first rainwater in the region.
Also, on Sunday and Monday there will be a series of tropical rainforests in Arizona, but there will be more rainwear on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rainbows will go to four corners and will expire until Wednesday.
October can have strong temperature variations in the United States, as the Arctic Territories cool, but the temperate temperatures of the tropics will be maintained.
These temperatures occasionally have significant changes in short distances.
As an example, there will be significant temperature changes on Sunday in the middle of the United States.
There are almost 20 different degrees in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha among the cities of Nebraska and the cities of St. Louis and Des Moines (Iwaa).
In the next few days, the warmness of the summer will come and spread all the places.
The middle and east of the United States will have warm October, with 80 degrees of temperature from the south to the northeast.
They can also be 80 degrees per Tuesday in New York, with a total of more than 10 degrees of average temperature.
Depending on the long-term weather forecast, the United States will suffer higher temperatures than the average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people see the declaration of Brett Kavanagh
More than 20 million people saw the declaration of the candidate of the High Court on the 6th of Tuesday’s Channel news by Brett Kavanagh and Christine Blasy Ford, who reported sexual abuse suffered in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued and the Catalan presenters held a final news of the Friday program: Senator from Arizona agreed with the FBI to conduct a weekly study.
According to Ford’s Board of Deputies, it is absolutely true that Kavanagh once again touched him and attempted to remove his clothes at a festival in the institute.
For Kavanaugh, he said in a fiery declaration he was sure that he didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen data, approximately 20.4 million people were represented on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox Channel and MSNBC channels.
However, this amount was not immediately useful for other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems in the number of people watching television at the offices.
For example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or with the Academy Prizes.
With regard to Fox News Channels, the presenters of Kavanagh fully accept the statement of the channel while he was making a statement of 5,69 million spectators, said Nielsen.
The ABC was the second, with 3,26 million spectators.
CBS accounted for 3.1 million, the NBC obtained 2,94 million, 2,89 million, and CNN accounted for 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After listening to the statement, the interest of the people remained.
Falke was the heart of the Friday drama.
After communicating that the office of the moderate Republican Party would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of the CNN and CBS recorded a lift surrounded by demonstrations while trying to enlist aboard the Magistrate.
He looked directly on the CNN channel while the demonstrators crashed.
I’m here,” a woman said.
Do you really think the truth is saying?”
And he added: “You have the power of the wicked one, but many women have nothing to do.”
At that moment, and before closing the doors of the lift, Flak said that his office published a notification and that he will give more details in the views of the assembly.
The views were being broadcast directly by cables and television channels every hour and while the Magistrate was voted to be a Senator Kavanaugh.
However, Flack said that the FBI would vote after a week of analysis of the arguments against the candidate, remember that the minority was asking for such a democratic aspect.
After talking to her friend, Dr. Chris Cons, a democratic Senator who almost fully believed in the study.
After talking to Coson and various Senators, Flack took his final decision.
The decision of the flak was powerful, because the Republican party does not need to vote for accept Kavanaugh.
The President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to analyse the arguments against Kavanagh.

Before the referendum to vote for a referendum between the police and the Government of Catalonia
Six people have been arrested this Saturday in Barcelona to commemorate the first anniversary of the elections held in Catalonia by thousands of protesters against the crime.
A group of pro-independence men disguised as riots, but the eggs and the paint dust came out, resulting in the formation of dust clouds in the streets full of tourists.
More fighting took place when the police were using their combats to stop the disputes.
In addition, teams for independence spent several hours before singing unionists “We will not forget,” which were singing “excellent life” to Spain.
According to local journalists, fourteen people received treatment for the little injuries received during the conflict.
There is a lot of nervousness in this region that seeks to find independence after elections on 1 October, which were illegal according to the government of Madrid, but it was a day to celebrate the Catalan independence.
Most voters voted for independence, but the citizen participation was very small for the number of citizens who wanted to vote for election.
According to the Catalan authorities, after an attack by police, there were 1000 armed votes to stop voters who had gone to the places where the voting stations were located.
The independence teams have been disqualified on Friday to avoid a demonstration in favor of the national police.
The demonstration was carried out, but they forced him to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the demonstration for his wife and said that Catalonia is no longer hope of independence.
We spent last year a wonderful moment.
My parents were happy to vote, but now we are stuck.”
After having achieved a piric but important victory in the recent December elections, the Catalan parties for independence have faced many problems in keeping with the interests of the people this year; some leaders have been interfered or have been arrested and a trial has been waiting for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording on his phone and he claims that the policy of both parties is guilty of this situation.
He said "There's more and more tension".
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, leader of Catalonia, said he was waiting for the trial in prison for the next year.
If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to advocate the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government.”

Thanks to the men’s launch, Livingstone wins 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Men's first goal endorses the height of Livingston
Livingston, who has been promoted by Rangers, plays a key role in the 18 matches of his second team.
The shot by Dolly Meng was decisive in the second half when Gary Holtten's squad was climbed on a level.
The teams of war are left without winning this Premiership season and have to play against Hearts leaders (who have eight more points).
Before that match, Rangers must play with Rapid Vienna on Tuesday in the European League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team is defeated without defeat and six matches are left this season; Holt does not know what failure is since they have been replaced by Kenny Miller during the last month.
Livingston loses several possibilities in the face of strong visitors
The Dutch team had to take the first step before they scored, because they had a huge success, it caused several problems to team Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way before the gate, but when all his efforts were lost, Alan Lithow re-directed his efforts to the door after the Battle of Craig Halt.
The hosts were counted with having fun playing Rangers, but they knew that visitors could be disappointed at any time.
And with that mood, the decisive goal arrived.
Rangers provided a free shot and Livingston set up an open space to mark the Mengú, whose goal was to score the ball in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the match, Rangers were now under control, but their domestic defense was uneasy and the match was played without any problems by the goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This model continued until the second half of the second half, but the shot by Alfredo Morelos asked for his complete skill of Kelly.
Scott Pittman couldn’t score his goal in Rangers for his goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithrow prevented his other play in Livingstone.
The days went back in the area of Livingston and there were over and over again, two criminals who were asked for murder due to a defiance of Glendton’s representative, and the other two were excluded.
Livingston's game "single" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, Scotland's BBC, at Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston has been a great game and a great result.
For me they have made exceptional hands and have great opportunities to climb the level.
Although the style of the games and the group has not changed almost since it reached the first level, Hotel has been an exceptional coach: it has placed the group directly from the arrival.
He had several heroes.
Harkett’s work has been huge, she has organized and managed a unique defence, and Menga has been in charge of Connor Goldon and Joe Worall in the whole game.
Rangers did not have much inspiration.
They work very well when they are in war orders, but they forgot the standards established by the coach.
The last move has been too weak and they only have to overcome the defense of their homes; the Rangers must be quickly taken out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan discovers opposite welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skis on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met to enjoy them in Berlin.
It is the last day of the visit by the president of Germany to resolve the relationship between the NATO and the Allies.
They discuss issues such as the lack of human rights and press freedom and access to Turkey in the European Union.

Long Lartin prison: six officers in a confrontation
Six officers of prison were injured in a prison with severe security, said the prison office.
The clash was founded at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday morning at 09:30 hours (BST) and has not yet ended.
The official "Tornardo" experts have arrived in prison to end the conflict that had begun with eight arrests, for now it has been limited to a wing of the building.
The officers were wounded in the face and immediately healed them.
A representative of the prison service said: “We have sent expert prisons to finish the riots of the MP Long Latin.
We have six employees who have been healed for the wounds that have been taken.
We will not accept any violence in our prisons and we will deliver the war to the police and they will surely spend much more time between prison bars.”
The MP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 arrests and, among them, the most violent criminals of the country.
In June, the prisoner had to go to hospital for the attack.
In addition, in October the officer would have to go to jail to stop a serious crime, because the arrests were attacking the workers with bullets.
Rosa has become a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City cities (there may be some benefits of dry areas)
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but this will happen the next week while the waters of Rosa run out of her strength; it will visit the southern desert and there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already been sent a warning on the Monday and Friday about the sudden floods that may arise; the waters of Arizona will enter the south-east of California and Utah will also flow from cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go live on Tuesday, but on Monday the rain will announce her arrival.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has written the following in a tweet: "The ten tropical storms born from Phoenix to 200 miles have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane on the AZ border with 40 miles."
According to the latest forecasts of the national centre of Urakan, 2-4 inches will gather up to 6 inches of water on the edge of the Arizona Mogolon.
With respect to other areas of the south-west of the desert (the Rocky Mountains and the Great Rock, among others), 1-2 inches of water will be gathered in isolated places for a maximum of 4 inches.
Those who expect sudden floods can be a blessing to Rosa’s rain, due to the drought suffered by the territory.
Floods do not need to be diminished, but these rain sprawlings can be beneficial for the droughts in the south.
According to the U.S. drought control service, 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from severe droughts, which is the second highest category.
First, the path to Rosa will pass through the Californian Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa will remain the force of the water on Sunday morning and will generate a maximum of 85 miles (up to 385 mi) south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and will have a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding colder water in the Pacific and, therefore, its potential is weakening.
That way, it will arrive on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm to Mexico.
Since some Mexican sites can be harsh, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "the rainforest will leave the water of 3-6 inches from Baja California to the south of Sonora, and some places may collect 10 inches."
After that, Rosa crossed the north of Mexico to reach the border with Arizona as a tropical storm during the hours of the week, after crossing Arizona and going south to Utah.
The main threats to Rosa or her storms are the hard storms that emerged in the Pacific, the north-west of the Son and the southwest of the United States,” said the national water centres.
These rains will generate sudden dangerous floods and stalks in deserts and landfalls in the mountains.

Trump says that Kavanagh “has to suffer without a sense of belonging to the democratic party”
The vote for the judge for Kavanaugh states in the myth of Trump in Wheeling (West Virginia).
Trump also said that Kavanagh had to endure “the nonsense and rage” of the democratic party during his appointment.
Having stayed in front of the Congress, Kavanagh made his way to the Congress. According to his woman, he was a young man who had been raped by the Kavanagh for decades.
Ford also had testimony after listening to his unbelief.
The Lehendakari said on Saturday: "The citizens of the United States saw the courage, intelligence and quality of Kavanagh on that day."
The vote for choosing the judge confirms that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this jurist has dedicated his entire life to the supporters of West Virginia.
He spoke not only about the appointment of Kavanaugh, but also about the role of the Republican party in these elections.
There are five weeks remaining to vote in the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to do the campaign" he said.
That’s why I’m here to fight for the best candidates”.
Trump also said that the democratic party is using strategies to “opportune and difficult” the campaign.
According to a High Court of Justice to the CNT, the procedural act of naming Kavanagh will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people die in the Russian and tsunami in Indonesia; the number of deaths increases
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis inflicted on the Sulawesei Island in Indonesia; most of them died while the giant waves destroying the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palau, but the waves six (18 feet) blew up the coast; several people were dragged to death and destroyed all along the way.
It was created as a result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Yesterday, the warning of the tsunami threat that had been reported to the beach and did not escape immediately,” said Stupo Purwo Ngro, representative of the Indonesia’s disaster in an interview given by the Norwegian agency (BPB).
Nugroro says that "Tumnamia", the car, the trunk and the house were dragged and destroyed all that was in the land", even the currency has travelled from the open sea to the speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coast (497 m/h).
Many people have gone to trees to escape from the water and live,” he said.
Approximately 16,700 people attended 24 Paluko 24 centres.
Several buildings and shops were destroyed, destroyed and surrounded by water on aerial photographs by the anti-waste agency.
The replicas of the earthquake continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes noticed in a territory of 2.4 million inhabitants.
According to the report published by the Indonesia Technology validation and application agency (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquake during World War II was stronger than about a nuclear bomb ejected in Hiroshima.
The geography of the city, which is in a long and narrow bay, may be related to the size of the currency, said by the agency.
According to Núgroho's statement, the disaster was enormously “grading”; thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims have found bodies among the ruins of destroyed buildings, which causes 540 more wounded and 29 people disappeared.
Núgroho also said that the number and catastrophe of the victims could increase through the 300 km coastline in Palau, especially a place called Donggala, close to the epicenter.
The communications in Norway do not work nor do we have any information,” said Nurhoro.
According to the Red Cross data, there are more than 300,000 inhabitants in this locality, for now, where employees and volunteers from the organisation travel to places affected.
It is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
On Saturday, the agency received strict criticism not to disclose information about the currency that was destroyed in Plu, but according to the official, the waves appeared to pass the notice.
In a shared recording on social media, you can see a man in a building, shouting “summa coming” to the street to warn people.
A few minutes later the water wall reaches the coast and cars are parked.
Reuters cannot immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Since earthquakes have generated global electricity cuts, all the Moon's media have been discontinued, so it has been difficult to organize rescue efforts to the competent authorities.
Under the authority, the military has sent assistance from the Jakarta and other cities in cargo, but the evacuation still requires food and preferential goods.
The city airport has reopened for assistance and will be closed to the public until October.
The president of the game will visit the evacuation centers of Paul on Sunday.
Indonesia’s currency leaves over 800 dead people.
It is a tragedy.
The workers of the World Vision in Dongga have arrived without problems in the city of Palau (the workers in which they are built on the floor of the organisation), but they have directly seen the disaster that the Mr. Doseba said.
He said that "they had seen a pile of houses".
That is very bad.
Despite the fact that the support teams put on tight repairs in disaster cases, experienced workers and workers were complained that some workers and workers did not want to go to Lapa.
In accordance with the legislation in Indonesia, international funding, supply and personnel can only be started after classifying it as a national disaster.
That has not happened yet.
It is still a provincial-class disaster,” says Aulia Arriani, the Red Cross spokesperson in Indonesia.
In the words of "government, OK, is the national disaster", we can open the doors for international assistance, but it has not yet been classified."
On the second night in the evening of Plu, the friends and families who still had disappeared and who did not lose sight of the miracle of their loved ones.
On Saturday, they took a small child out of the store.
On Sunday, the rescuers took out a woman who was armed with her mother’s body two days under the debris.
Gendon Subando, the group's members of the Indonesia's National Parpensives were part of the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others that were trapped at the Hotel Roa, including Mandagi Jn, were students.
As an expert in the world of paragliding, if I have my emotional charge,” he said.
Gendon J. explained that since they informed the people about the fall of the Roa Hotel in the Party, they were sending messages to the contestants that were on the beach.
His posts, however, managed only a single gray arrow, not two blue marks.
I think that this means that these messages were not sent,” added.

Kanye West: Rapero's name is Ye
Kanye West has changed the name - Yea now.
On Saturday, Twitter reported that the change was known as "Kanye West".
West, for 41 years, has used the Ye evil ones for a long time, and has used that evil as the title of his eighth album, which has been published in June.
He made the change in Saturday Night Live, where he hoped to be his last album, Yandhi.
Ariana Grande was represented in the show by the creator of the show because she could not participate as a result of “emotional reasons”.
As well as being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has also stated that this word has a religious meaning.
I think the word ‘ye’ is the most commonly used in the Bible and ‘you’,” said West has recently been talking about the album, Big Boy with the radio presenter.
"So I'm, we're, we.
comes from Kanye, who only means to become the reflection of our good, bad, confusion, and all.
This work reflects better who we are."
It is one of the most famous rappers that has changed the name.
Sean Combs also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has preferred Love and Brother Love.
JY-Z has also changed the short and serious letters that worked with West.
AMLO in Mexico has not used the army against the people
The president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has pledged that he has not used armed forces or army against the 50th anniversary of a repression against students.
López Obrador, who had worked on Saturday in the Plaza de Toledo, had never used the army to repeat the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the army fired a peaceful outbreak in the square, killing 300 people to stop the left-handed students across Latin America.
López Obrador has said that he will help Mexico to study, with monthly financial aid and with the opening of more free public universities.
In her opinion, she promotes unemployment and educational opportunities for young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. would have to double the AI financing
Since China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US would have to double the amount of research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee investors and AI experts who have worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Numerous parts of the U.S. government emerged when they made various communications about AI, although the U.S. has generally no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to turn AI into the best innovation by 2030.
"A dual research would be a good start because other countries are far from the US and seek the next AI discovery," Lee said.
Double funding can double the options for large AI discoveries in the U.S., indicating Leek at CNBC in a single week conversation.
This month, Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", has been the CEO of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who has researched one of the most important companies in China's AA.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University joined the U.S. top-level Othello player in an AI system and later worked as executive at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the Chinese field.
Lee praised previous technologies from the U.S. government, such as the Robotic Competition of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when he will be next to help identify the next dreamers.
American researchers often need to work hard to get government funding, says Leek.
"It does not mean that China leads them academic leaders, they are companies," added Leek.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have taken up lights from universities to act on AI in recent years.
Lee also said that change of immigration policies would help boost the U.S. activities of AI.
"I think that green cards would need to be automatically offered to AI PhDs," he pointed out.
In July 2017, the National Council of China launched the Development Plan of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The Foundation of Natural Science of China is funded by the National Foundation and other government bodies as it does in the USA, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
In that year, the U.S. Defense Department established an Artificial Intelligence Center where industrial and educational partners met and the White House established the Artificial Intelligence Commission.
And this month, the DAP has reported its investment of $2 billion in the AI NEXT initiative.
As for the NSF, it invests more than 100 million dollars per year in research into AI.
Meanwhile, the EU legislation that intended to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not had progress in recent months.
Macedonians had a referendum to decide whether to change or change the name of the country
The countries of Macedonia voted for a referendum to change or decide on the name of the "Old Republic of Macedonia", which would end the conflict of several decades since Greece blocked for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, a province named after ancient antiquity, still has its territory, and its name still blocks the possibility of joining NATO and the EU.
The government of the two countries reached an agreement in June, based on the new proposed name, but the rivalry claims that this change will be harmful to the ethnic identity of most of the population in Macedonia.
The president, Gjore Ivanov, stated that he would not vote for the referendum and gave the campaign a question of whether the boycott would have to be valid for a 50 percent in the referendum.
This is a question that could be read on the referendum paper: "Are you in favour of the agreement of being NATO and EU?
Those who choose to change the name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it deserves the possibility to join the EU and NATO organizations for Macedonian, being one of the countries that had been destroyed by Yugoslavia.
I come to vote for the future of the country for young people of Macedonia, so that this would be able to live free under the umbrella of the European Union," said Oliver Georgyjevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although this is not legally binding, members of parliament have stated that they will continue to be a decisive result of the vote.
In order to change the name, three thirds of the Parliament will be required.
The State Selection Committee stated that there was no surprise until an hour.
However, only 16 percent voted compared to the 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections for 2016, in which the 66 percent eligible for vote was voted.
"I went for my children to vote, our place is in Europe" said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, at the capital, the Skoppje voterer.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko can change the name of the country in the referendum in Macedonia and enter the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kardarkov, 54 years old, a small stage and a climb to get ready before those who wish to make a boycott to the referendum that was supposed to be held.
We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to meet our requirements and not enter the door of the servants"
We are a poor country, but if we have dignity.
If they don’t want to be a Macedonian, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asia gathering."
The Prime Minister, Zaev, says that NATO can bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is about 20 percent.
I believe that there will be more than 80 percent of citizens because it is in favour of the EU and NATO" said Zaev after he vote.
He said, “also,” “to say, “to confirm our future”.
According to the survey published by the Organization for Political Research in Macedonia, it would take 30 to 43 percent in the vote of voters - less than necessary.
Another survey, the Telema TV in Macedonia, said that 57 percent of the residents had thought to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent of whom said he would vote for.
To get a successful referendum, you need to get 50 plus a percentage vote.
If there is a defect in the referendum, it would be the first serious breach of the Western Policy since it began in May of last year.
See: player Sergio Aguero from Manchester City beats all the defences of Brighton to get the goal
Sergio Ageo and Raheem Steling passed all defences of Brighton at the league win at Manchester City, at the Euthad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored a very simple goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine golfer received a walk in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
Run between the three leaders of Brighton, before entering the open field.
Ageo suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He promoted a defender on the edge of the Brighton.
Then he went to the left side and there was String.
The Englishman returned to Ageo in his first contact with the ball, who used his right hand to beat the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a shot right over the net.
The journalist, who said "Ageo is having several problems" said the City Manager, Pep Guardiola.
We said he was going to play "55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were very glad that he entered that moment."
But Stelling gave the blue elastic the initial advantage of the Premier League competition.
The goal arrived in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton’s hand.
He spent a great time on his left to Leroy Sanei.
Sam made a few touches to his remote pole before directing it to Stterling.
The blue stairway pushed the ball to the grid before leaving.
The City Championship will compete in the Champions League, at 12:55 in Sinsheim, in the Rhein-Neck- Arena football field, in Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end to Rockie
Nationals out of competition, there was no big reason to force them to another beginning.
However, Scherzer wants to take advantage of the competitive advantage of Sunday’s Colorado Rocks, but Rocks still experience the consequences of equality in the NL West.
Rockie has achieved a minimum of 5-2 win at least on Friday night, but still they will have to try to win the first level title.
If we play at least for nothing, we know that the atmosphere in Denver, it will be crowded, and the opposing team will play at the best level in all areas we will have to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?
Nationals are still forced to announce a trigger, but it seems that they will leave Schnauzer in this state.
Scherzer, who would launch his 34th line, held a kick-off session on Thursday and seems to be like a kicker on Sunday.
The Washington man has 18-7.53 in the EERA and he has achieved 300 strikeout in the 2/3 of this year’s entry.
Trump statements in West Virginia
The president analyzed the situation in which he was elected by the Supreme Court, and he mentioned the situation in relation to the importance of the participation of the republics in the middle-season elections.
It’s all we’ve done at the game in November.
We have five weeks of major elections in our lives.
It's one of the big ones -- I'm not a candidate but, because I'm not a candidate, so I'm in every place to compete with big candidates".
Trump added, “You can see the huge extreme group of Democrats, you can now see what is happening here.
And they don’t have any doubts to eliminate the power of any means necessary, see the nonsense.
No matter who to hurt, pass over who control and get power, we will not give them that."
The Democrats, whose aim is to "sustain and prevent" it.
As you could see in the last four days, he added that the Democrats “having angry and prudently and frail and false”.
The Democratic Party's Speaker of the Senate's Democratic Party, Diane Feinstein, was signed by the Senate Court Council, who received the audience shouts.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you filter the document?
Eh, eh, what.
No, oh, I'm waiting for a - the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The crops will not continue to have a high reach.
It's intolerant with those who say they think
When the agents of the local side voted against me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
In fact, I was the last one off the list we didn’t welcome from the MPs of Labor – for saying all what we thought.
I also got a similar treatment to a member of the parliament, Joan Ryan, who spoke to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censoring emotion criticised me if he wouldn’t agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible financial policy, in the national security, in Europe, Jeremy was not in agreement with the previous authorities.
We want meetings to be “inclusive and productive” about the East Nottingham meeting on Friday.
During the eight years that I have been working as a local Labs MP, these meetings have been held on Friday night.
Unfortunately, this time it has not been a word to “like, respectful” policy if it has ever been.
It is evident that there are different views on the labour market and the opinions are judged whether they are acceptable to the leaders of the party.
It began as Jeremy became the leader, when we had the same political views that we had before began to turn 180 degrees and I couldn’t accept views from the national security and the single EU market.
Every time I talk to the public - it doesn’t matter what I say - a lot of opinions that I don’t have to be in the Labour Party.
That’s not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I have a better luck than some of my members, as they are political views against me.
I depend on the people who have to face every day on the persecutions of sex or persecutions with professionalism and honesty, but never shame, I am subject to those who have to deal with it.
One of the most unpleasant aspects of this period's politics is that it is now normal levels of bullying.
Jeremy Corbyn, who said in the previous week, should promote the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we do not obtain a single opinion when every ‘non-conformity’ motion or the rules of the party become more tight.
In the last two years I have received several notes to go ahead, not to talk so much and thus say that I’d be going to be right.
But I am not in this policy.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I went into the public services that I abandoned and needed to leave the room driven by the government’s governments – as minister of local government.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will have any doubts about my political views and the current disagreements with the current leaders.
I would tell those who promoted the ‘Friday’ motion to tell the country if it’s going to lead Brexit to harm our homes, businesses, and public services, I don’t understand that I’m not going to question my loyalty with the leaders of the Labour Party for the time and the loss of energy.
But my true message is not to encourage Nottingham, but to be part of my electrorship, I am very proud to work for you and I speak to you after working for what is best for your interests, I will not let them down with political files.
Chris Leslie MP is in East Nottingham
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is the leader who has not lost any game yet
The last two jumps to surprise changed a certain final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in the day-to-day Tennen tournament.
They are in the first position of the board, and they are the only ones who have not lost any of the ten games.
At the end, they had better defense and improved the possibilities. The house and the chef Peter Murchie have the right to be satisfied.
They have put us in the test so far and we haven’t lost none, so we should be happy.”
It was added by Robin Christi in Melrose: "My Honours to Ayr, because they used the options better than us."
The 14th-minute trials of Grant Anderson, executed by Frazier Climo, had already put Ayr, but the same cards taken by the Scottish Captain Roy Hughes were left by the Scottishman, Warriors of the game, and they were not able to add points to the attempt by Melros and Jason Baggot.
The first part was made up of a penalty for the first time, and the only one-off test was conducted at the end of the first half, and the Ayr 17-5 went to the break.
But the second part of the Merros was great and the rehearsals of Patrick Anderson, carried out by Baggote, reduced five points.
Then there has been a long break for the serious injury of the player Ruarih Kott, who was out of the hand bed and when the game was turned out to go back to North Star McDowall with the release of the hit "Clim".
The captain, Blair Macherson Ayr, then a man who benefitsd again, was not able to do so with the rehearsal of Bruce Covine, the end of his life.
When the houses were returned, the Strusan Hutchinsoni card, who left the Climo, touched the ground behind the table Ayr, which was then carried out by MacPherson.
Clim left, as he had done almost from the beginning, Kyle Rowk captured David Armstrong's uncle, and Gregor Henry, who captured Gregory Henry's wing at the fifth test of his home.

Ford wants to jump to the catering industry, since he was known to have been the conductor of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actress Jack Jarvisen plays the role of the BBC in her famous show, together with Greg Hemphill, who has long been a writer and a star.
The couple announced that the next season of the show will be the ninth and it seems that Kierran is planning a life after the show.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adif Limited.
The actress did not want to express anything about the story, although the sources of the Scottish Sun magazine said that she wanted to enter a “brand of major restaurants” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the interior Bolivian expects the opening of the road to the Pacific
The main coverage of marine men’s patrol boat units in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
From the Tticaca lake you can read the following motto: "The sea is our right.
To recover it is our duty.”
During the interior Bolivia, there are still numerous climates from the 19th century in Chile - which continue to suffer in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps more important than the last few decades, as Bolivia expects to resolve international courts after five years of reflection on the 1st of October.
"Bolivia lives the right time with a sense of compatibility and calm, and of course, awaits the result," says Roberto Calzada, diplomat Bolivia.
Many Bolivians will continue the decision of the international court by means of large screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will give the reason to the demands of Bolivia - after the negotiations that has endured decades - in which Chile has been forced to negotiate a sovereign route to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charming Bolivian president - who has once again been elected for the next year - also made several contributions about the resolution of the Monday.
We are very close to the Pacific Ocean at the end of August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia and therefore will not change much.
The United Nations located in the Netherlands has no power to deliver the territory of Chile and has stated that it does not decide on the results of negotiations.
The international court resolution concludes the negotiations six months after the end of the negotiations, "The case is not difficult," said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law.
And rather than promoting the cause of Bolivia, they have retreated in the last four years.
"The current administration of Bolivia takes the theme of reaching the sea as a cap," said Zarate.
The bull run of the bullfighter’s calcareous rhetoric on Chile says that he’s going to do everything he’s going to do.
Bolivia and Chile still need to address several issues, but it will be very difficult to follow the discussion after it.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Velzé, representing Bolivia, does not agree with those who have a special issue of the court.
On Monday, Bolivia said "It will be a great opportunity to strengthen relations with Chile" and "to end the year 139 of unconformity", both for the good."
Calzadilla stated that it is not in agreement with Morales - is still one of the most popular in South America - with those who use it to get political support from the sea.
The right to reach the Pacific Ocean will never be denied,” he added.
It is the opportunity that we should see in order to overcome the decision."
North Korea says nuclear demarage will not happen until it can believe in the US
The Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho say his country is not going to be disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
This was revealed to the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States on the summit of Singapore to meet the leaders of the enemy.
The Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, from Singapore, noted that he is bound to block nuclear diplomacy for more than three months.
Kri says that “the utopia” is a continuous punishment and that in the face of the end of the Korean War, the U.S. objections to the end of the war would put the North Korea at its feet.
Washington doesn’t want to agreement on the recognition of Pyongyang before the movement of weapons withdrawal.
Both Kim and the President of the United States, Donald Trump want the second peak.
But there is a lot of scepticism because it is the only way the country looks like a serious Pyongyang.
The intent of Pompeo is to go to Pyongyang next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show shows the most recent route of the greatest sparks on your side of the High Street
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or you want to block the sun completely, here is the answer.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Brown presented a series of large-scale unique hats in the 2019 springboard, which left behind the style shown at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, there have been no practical hats to Instagram and these designers have taken their spectacular designs to the walkway.
The most outstanding pieces of Valentino, with a damp-coloured hat, covered with pattern heads.
We have a kind of fixture full of jewellery, a rare hat, and also a paint-like paint - but they are not a self-heat design.
Thomas Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - in time for Halloween.
Many masks full of colors are packed with lips and Hannibal Lecteri seems to be more than a Haute Couture.
One looks like a diving mask, with eyeglasses and tube, and another with an ice melted cone.
If you are a fashion follower, you have good news.
Experts in the style say the hatred will come out of the street, even to your surroundings.
The large-scale hats come after the ‘La Bomba’, a pastry-plate from two-foot wide wings, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, which we have seen from many famous people.
The cultural brand behind the hat that has not been practical on social networks has brought another object to the passage - the mattress bag for the beach is almost as big as the bathing model.
The playoffs of the Spring Festival of La Riviera 2019. The Parisian folk bag, cut with radish and white leather handles during the Spring Festival has been completed.
The stylistic Luke Armitage said in FEMALE: “I hope the big hat and big beach bag reaches the main streets in the next summer, the designer would be very difficult to ignore the demand of giant accessories.”
John Edward: Basic Languages for Global Citizens
The independent Scottish schools have conducted academic excellence registers which have continued in 2018 with exceptional exams results that have been consolidated with the excellence of both individual and group results in sports, among others, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service for students and their parents.
The objective of independent schools is to train students for higher education, their career and citizens.
Since we can design and implement a personalised school curriculum as a educational sector, we have seen that modern languages continue to be the usual option for students.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak in a language that you understand somebody, you will come to himself.
If you speak in his language, you will come to his heart."
It is a powerful way to build relations with people from other countries and gain confidence in them.
The results of this year’s final study show that languages are among the most developed independent classes.
The 68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved the best A ranking.
The data, gathered in the SS7 school, show that 72 percent of students had the highest ranking in Chinese Mandarin A; 72% in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This certifies that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an essential capacity for young people and children in the future.
Languages are currently being developed as a central subject (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in both independent and other schools.
In 2014 a survey of the EU found that one of the main reasons found in the job was non-languageity.
More and more, knowing languages is becoming essential to prepare young people for future careers.
With more work opportunities that language requires, these skills are essential in the global world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future.
Being able to speak directly to people from foreign countries will automatically lead the competition for multi-lingual people.
According to the survey carried out by YouTubers in 2013, 75% could not speak foreign languages, as a regular interview, and the only speakers speaking in French climbed to two digits, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in teaching languages in today’s children.
Talking more than one language, mostly used in economic development, will give your kids more opportunities to find better employment.
In Scotland, classes differ depending on the language they teach.
A number of students prefer more classical languages, and others that will be relevant to the EU in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
They are interested in your child, there will always be a wide range of learning languages independently at school with experts in the field.
The objective of Scottish independent schools is to prepare children to succeed in the future in various tasks and to provide them with tools for this.
This time we can not deny it, in an international business environment where languages are essential for the future of the country, so that it is necessary to reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as “international communication ability.”
The independent schools will continue to offer their opportunity, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il fut le faire of the two.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools

Trump seems to be going to direct the listeners of the Supreme Court of this week to be the confirmation of the Senate that he has held the vote for sexual immorality, which he has held for the duration of his investigations by the FBI.
But the main objective of this manoeuvre is to help republicans win a series of votes in the November elections.

Ryder Cup 2018: The US team will try to continue on Sunday individual competition
After three sessions on one side, the Saturday’s afternoon was told by the club’s team.
The current key is a closed sports concept in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say the moment is now?
They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think the moment is, in some way," said Jordan Spieth, when they had a one-day area.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, of the twelve games.
America, as Spieth says, they feel that the wind does not favor them, and they need help, most notably Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and managed to score three points from the flat.
Spirit has been absolutely decisive, from a draw to a green model.
The growing popularity of these tributes led to a great increase in the number of turns, which has been well accepted by winning four all-squares, after the two were lost by Thomas.
In the 15th match he held another prize with a similar score, stating that the American team is not out of competition.
You must look for strength and take care of your game alone," said Spieth.
It is the one that stops these players.
18 holes to get out of the difference.
The only players who have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleet, the historic footballers of the Ryder Cup.
Special but charming European couples are four from four, and they are sure to miss them.
The "Moliod" was the only couple on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday the morning, the Bogies were also killed and the last nine boys were on Friday.
This shift, towards the crowd, made up of a couple of people who had to overcome the energy on Sunday and there was no more famous European players to close Europe’s victory at the First Golf National.
If both together are better in different holes.
However, it is the morning to talk to the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson accelerates Sergio García’s work, the best quartet, when he was matched with Alex Noren.
They have put one and two of them before the Spanish and Swedish in the hole that was never too close to them.
However, on Sunday, it wasn’t meant to help you out of your hole.
The quartet was deeply fascinated by the interaction between the couple, the advice they provided, what they did not give, and how they could change the strategy at one point.
Europe played a better side and had a pronounced chance for the final, but the quartet session showed that the American team is encouraged to fight, some of them even if they questioned States in particular.
Europe reaches a 10-6th advantage in the final of the Ryder Cup
Europe has made a significant advantage in the final of the Ryder Cup, the Saturday’sboards against the United States with 10-6.
The couple's inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina attempted to win two victories against Tiger Woods and obtained four valuable points in the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjor, who was part of Europe, wanted to recover the lost prize in Hazelnen two years ago, was the main one in the morning who won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered a higher resistance and won two matches, but they could not exceed the difference.
On the side of Jim Fury they had to have eight points to support the prize in the 12 individual Sunday matches.
Fleetwood is the only European rook of four consecutive points and together with Molina, after a brilliant weekend called "Mollwood", which is the second to win four points in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourball, he played an amazing game with Woods and the American drummer Bryans Dechambeau.
Woods, after two games on Saturday or after playing, showed his love for him, but he lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, 7 consecutive.
Justin Rose left for four early football clubs and returned with Henrik Sten to defeat 2&1 at Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world’s best and third.
Europe did not find its way to a pleasant day in the south-west of Paris.
Three times earned by Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas, a reference for the American, was set up on Saturday.
The 2-1 victory was won by four Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poller in fourballs and then by Roy McIlroy, after losing two initial holes in the 4&3 quarters.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has managed to overcome the four points and to enter the individual ones, although Fury only needed a draw to hold the prize.
Two days after being the second best, after the opposite situation of Sunday, they will be placed before him.
North Korea has given its no confidence in giving weapons to it
The foreign minister of North Korea warned the United Nations that the punishments continue to limit confidence in the United States and do not, under any circumstances, allow nuclear weapons to be made.
Ri Yong has pointed out that the entire world’s annual Plenary on the fact that North Korea had ‘significant good intentions’ over the last year, the suspension of nuclear and missiles trials, leaving places for nuclear testing and talking to nuclear technology and developing weapons.
However, we do not see the appropriate answer for the US side,” he said.
"There is no trust in our national security and in no way we can leave only the first weapons."
As part of a process of ‘phase’ in which North Korea would have been gradually rewarded by the fact that it had not been seen in the past as a debauchery of Pyyang.
Rik Kim Jong Unek and Donald Trump mentions the first summit of the U.S. President, Donald Trump, on June 12, in which he gave the word to the “discuperament of the Korean peninsula” and Trump made sure he had done that he secured the security of North Korea.
The North Korea is looking for a way to formalize the War of the Korean War between 1950 and 1953, but the U.S. declares that it must leave its first weapons.
Washington has ignored the deaths of the North Korea in the wake of international voices.
The US insists that it must leave its first weapons and continue to increase the level of pressure of the sentences in order to achieve their goal, and that “the end of the war” is against Rik.
It’s a utopia that’s not known by the sanctions, is a utopia that we are unable to think about at their feet.
The problem is that the continuous punishments are increasing defiance."
Rik has not cited it at the beginning of the week as the second peak between the United States Presidents Kim and Trump.
On the other hand, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae, leader of South Korea in the last five months, and added: “The other party was in South Korea instead of the United States, would not be blocked.”
However, the tone of the Riren speech would be completely different in the past, where the North Koreans were in the United States, as they were possibly looking at the U.S. Marines, from what was called the " Mr. Trump".
This year before the United Nations, Trump said that he would “told” the North Korea because Kim had a courage to take the removal of weapons, but he stated that he was still to be done and would continue with the punishment until he decolonising North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he didn’t have time for that, “although it’s three years or five months’ time – he says the same thing.”
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Python for the steps given.
However, the Secretary of the United States, Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday: “The Commission of Security must continue to strengthen the sanctions of the Security Council until we make sure that its declusion is real”.
The Security Council has individually promoted the sanctions in North Korea since 2006, as a attempt to block the financing of nuclear and visual programs in Python.
He met Pompeo Ri outside the UN Plenary Sitting, then began to visit Pyongyang again in preparation for his second summit.
Pompeo has been three times this year in North Korea, but the last trip was not welcomed.
When Pyongyang returned from July to North Korea saying that something was only obtained for the North Korea, that during the time that it was reported that the ‘many demands’ that the ‘ganters do’.
North Korea kept a meeting with Moons when the United States would leave their places in places of missiles and a nuclear complex if they take appropriate measures.
Kim said he was looking for "measured measures to them" that Trump had agreed security guarantees for Singapore and he focused his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students have taken the course to rest
The year of Harvard University will focus on pursuing an increasingly expanding culture involving coffee for spending.
A teacher saw that in the best universities in the world, students lose their reward in the way they take care of themselves.
Charles Czestil, a doctor of sleep at the Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist in women and women’s hospitals, designed the course, which is the first person to think about this type of EU.
He began the course when he gave a lecture on sleep deficiency.
• At the end I came a girl and said to me, “Why do I just do that now, in my last year of my school?”
He said that no one told me how important it is to do, and that was what I was surprised.”
This course also explains the impact of students on studies and sports results, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Medical School at Harvard and Director of Health Services at the University, stated that the university decided to set up a course when students saw that they had little sleep throughout the week.
The course for a long time covers several interactive tasks.
In one section, the image of a room where students can view the effects of coffee, tins, coachs and book makers, and to appreciate the importance of sleep in sports performance.
In another section, the participants are informed of the possibility of having too little sleeps for their heart, and can increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On a map of the campus, using interactive icons, the participants are invited to reflect on their everyday lives.
We know that we will not change the habits of students.
But we believe that you have the right to know if you choose to smoke cigarettes, just like you have the right to know the effects that this will have on your health,” added Cizelers.
The culture of pride still exists for “upagas”, says that modern technologies and the problem of getting less pressure to students.
Well sleeping with a good quality sleep, it should be a “skeeping weapon” to resist stress, fatigue and nervousness, as well as gaining weight, because doing little sleep makes the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California that studies chemical and physical biology, has helped him design the Cizesler course, one of his first classes in the first year of Harvard.
The course indicated that he opened his eyes and encouraged him to take part in a course that included the campus.
The next step, he expects, would be to apply for a similar research to the postgraduates before entering into a competitive institution.
Ceisler recommends students to make the alarm when they go to the bed and learn about the impact of the ‘blue light’ on electronic displays and LED lights, which can change their ‘cistic’ rhythms and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men’s Wardden Men
Rangers have suffered another defeat at Dolly Men's strike in Livingston.
After winning the first place in February 4-1 at St. Johnston, Gary Holt's team made a second defeat on his 18th match as a coach, allowing his eight points to escape without controlling the Hearts of the leader of the Landbrooks.
Meng spent seven minutes before the strike, and Rangers did not win the draw.
Rangers have now fallen into sixth position, while Livingston climbs to the third and are only on the other side of the plane.
The problem might be more severe for Rangers because they had to treat the Calum Spence flying head of the head due to an object that had been hit from the outside.
The war made eight changes and managed to reach the semi-finals of the Ayr Beffred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi 11, who removed a point from Hearts during the past week, and would be happy to see how his well-fitted garments were drowned in each turn.
Rangers managed to dominate ownership, but Livingstone benefited from their own hands.
The goal scored by Scott Pittman, who was shot by Alan McGregor in the wings of the Mena, would have failed to take advantage of it.
A deep free shot at Keaghan Jacobs found the Captain Craigkett, but his team only managed to move to the back pole.
Rangers took control, but in the last third it seemed to be more hope in terms of their game.
He thought he had to be a criminal on the fourth border, when he was hit by Steven Lawless, but the judge Steven Thomson did not consider Colombian claims.
Rangers managed to make only two shots in the first half, but former goalkeeper from Ibrox did not have any problem with the head of Lassa Coubally and the light blow by Oviedo Ejaria.
The first goal scored by Livi in the 34th minute might harm the game, but no one can deny that they had done much effort.
Once again, Rangers did not get to challenge a game of Jacobs.
Scottfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who soon chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Warr claimed to change with Kubolily Ryan Kent, and the change had immediate effect when the wing passed over Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran the line.
But Livingston was forced to play their favourite game after long walks by Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase its advantage, but McGregor maintained firmly before the leadership came from the Lithow stream.
The replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, once again asked for a criminal with Jacobs, but Thomson did not carry out any case again.
Almanka: The inventor of the Geiger meter
And now a German page of our "Sunday Morning" was born in Germany, on September 30, 1882, 13, at a time when physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure the electrostatic: after this invention, the device Geiger came.
Since then, Geiger has been a milestone for science, and has also become a milestone for pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bels of Coronado”, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who were the protagonists:
Man: "What's the reason?"
Rogers: "Geiger meter, used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you place these headsets, you can listen to the effects of the atoms caused by the conduction of minerals."
Evans: "Yes, she is listening to it right now!"
The "Hans" Geiger died in 1945, lacking a few days to celebrate 63 years.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system ‘seeing’ evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach ‘seeing’ cells and killing the immune system
The vaccine teaches the immune system to the treatment
The method consists of extraction of immune cells from the patient and then alternating the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that is common in many cancers and then rejoin
The test vaccine is providing very good results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to the disease, thus achieving the disappearance of ovarian cancer more than 18 months.
The method consists of removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory to be able to "view" a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2 and then reimagining the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, the National Cancer Institute of Bethesda (Maryland) said: "Our results show that we have a promising vaccine."
Her2 advocates "a growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explained by Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to how patients take immune cells and reach carcinogenic cells has worked on treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye joined a party in favor of West Trump, wearing a MAG, after the SNL outbreak.
it didn't come out well
Kanye West shouted at a Saturday Night Live as president of the United States, Donald Trump, who said he was going to be again president in 2020.
After playing the third song at night, Ghost Town, Make America wearing a top-down hat, became a bad deal against Democrats and reaffirms Trump’s protraction.
"When I talk to a white person what I say: "How do you like Trump, it's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, then I would have been away from America for a long time,” he said.
She began her session with a sketch in SNL, in which her husband, Christine Blasy Ford, took over the witness of the Senate Standing Orders.
Although it was not broadcast, the offensive talk of West was raised by the comedy Chris Rock on social media.
It is not clear whether Rock West was trying to leave it ridiculous.
He also complained that West had gone badly among the wings because of his hat.
"I have attacked me among the wings.
They told me, ‘Don’t leave with that beret’.
They attacked ME!
And then they say that I am in a place where I loose the bottom,” he said, according to Washington Examine.
West continued: "Do you want to see the place you’re going to hit?" "I'm going to put my superman, because this means that you cannot say what I have to do.
Test love."
As a result of his words, at least one pair of whistles came from the public and were embarrassed by SNL's members, Variety reported that there was a person who told the magazine: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West brought him to replace Ariana Grande, who had been killed by a few days before, the rapper Rack Miller.
Web was shocked by a lot of people with the I love interpretation, wearing Perry like a bottle.
West received the support of Randal Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA, who published this tweet, "One of the most daring Spirits: Thank you for facing the MAFI.
But as Karen Hunter wrote, West was simply being the same and that is wonderful."
"But I don't want to reward a person who makes a ideology that is harmful to the community (including his music or clothes or protecting his art).
He is free.
And we also add it," he added.
Before the session, the rapper changed his name to Twitter, saying that “has now been renamed Kanye West”.
It is not the first artist to change the name, and it follows the steps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, was also called Snoop Lion, and how he did not mention the same legend as Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and became a Prince until that time.

Game of Thrones stars exposed against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington Jon Snow is known for the role of the sword in the medieval fantasy series of Game of Thrones HBO.
But the 31-year-old actress appeared against the sexist hero, stating that this type of paper often reminds young boys that they often feel hard to respect.
In his statements to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that something was wrong, and how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the time of #Metoo.
Kit also was recently married to Rose Leslie, a star of Game of Thrones, and he admitted that he should be faced with the problem of ‘the fact’.
‘Personally, and with great certainty, at this time I think - what have we done wrongly,’ he said.
What have we taught men when they are growing, taking into account the problem we see now?
Kit also believes that television can have its own responsibility with regard to the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male character.
He continued: "What is the default and what is it taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that young boys should do this way of being?
I believe that this is one of the most important issues of our time. How can we change it?
For something is evident that it has gone wrong for the young men.'
He admitted in the interview that he won’t make any previous or subsequent series of Game of Thrones in the next summer, and said he ‘who finished with battlelines and horses’.
As of November, Kit Sampard will appear on his return to True West, a film producer and his brother’s story.
The actor recently reported that Rose has been the best thing that he has given to his wife, Game of Thrones.
‘I met my wife in this session, and so gave her my future family and previous life,’ she said.
Rose made Ygrette’s role, a woman who loves the Jon Snow characters in Kit, won the Emmy Award in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/Hesia: China reported that a 14% increase in new cases
China reported that it has been a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
In the country there are more than 80,000 people, who say that they are caused by health authorities.
More than 40,000 new cases have been recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, and this is a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly expanding due to blood transfusions in certain parts of China.
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to nearly zero, as the Chinese health authorities said in a provincial conference in Yunanna.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 per year.
The sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem in the China LGTB community.
Homosexuality was described in 1997 in China, but the discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
As a result of the country’s conservative values, it is estimated that 70-90% of men have sex with men.
Many diseases transmissions occur in the use of inappropriate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has mandated the GIB universal access to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects data from the stolen OP senators and puts them upside down ‘risk lies’ and ‘conspiratory theories’
On Saturday, a U.S. member of his team reported that he had published personal information from three U.S. Republicans on the pages of the legislative Wikipedia pages.
The Democrats of Los Angeles expressed their assertions that they were "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
"The lies, the lies, and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information contained contained the U.S. Senator: Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatt, both of them from Utah.
The information appeared on the Monday in a hearing of the claims on the unsuitable sexual behavior of the Supreme Court of the Senate published by Capitol Hill.
The shooting was later performed by the three Senators, Kavanaugh.
According to the conservative websites such as Gateway Putt and RedState, the IP address identifying the source was associated with the Waters office and published information from a Waters team member, Hill.
"This unfounded argument is completely false and complete," Waters continued.
The members of my team, who are at risk of identity, personal information and security, have no responsibility in relation to the filtration of such information.
The unfounded accusation is a completely false and complete lie."
Waters' statement was immediately received online reviews, such as the ex-president of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
This negation is made from the angry," wrote Fleischer.
This shows that they have no status as members of the Congress.
When something that hasn’t done to someone, it doesn’t have to worry about it.
It should not show a challenge-sensitive attitude.
It does not have to question the causes of the cause.
He must appear calm and tempting."
The reaction to Waters was apparent that Democrats wanted to compare Kavanaugh with the criticism of the trial, since critics considered too angry during the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate for the removal of Waters in the central half of the dictatorship, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
If it was true," he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said that it was "remarked by the authorities and the law enforcement agencies in relation to these claims.
We believe that "those who have broken the law will know what they are" and "they will have to respond to the law in terms of any kind of action that is harmful and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English Strikes Again Film Critics – Small Rowan Atkinson Speyer
The search for the meaning of Brexit has now become a traditional one in any new film with a British beam, which seems to be not applicable to the franchise of the Johnny English action comedy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
What kind of waste is going to be covered by a new export option for our nation?
In any case, the young eye-catching and rubber face-to-face Johnny English renewed for the second time, its name shows that it is only a large comic-creation designed for non-English- cinema-related territories.
Although he was especially fond of trying to get a fourth-place Glamour, he is a secret secret agent with Clouseu, of course, a ray of Mr Bean and a bit of boys who assists him in the opening event of the London 2012 Olympic Games with a single note, Chariots of Fire.
At Barclaycard, we have already forgotten the TV advertisements that Atkinson interpreted as a passenger and based on an international mysterious man, leaving behind the chaos.
There are one or two moments in this last trip from JER.
I really liked how Johnny English came to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor crosses them in the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is often seen on screen, but humour is not strong and superfluous, especially when ‘serious’ film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible, now include a comedy among its components.
The humour looks more than the adult, and for me Johnny English’s some absurd adventures are not just as big as the bear jokes of the character in the silent film of Atkinson.
The constant local premise is that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has been inferred from the popular web network of the British spyes, showing the personality of all the British actors working in the work, and being disqualified by the service agent, and Sadly for Kevin Eldon.
This is too much for a first minister who has a mailbox and persecuted character, who is losing the political reputation already: Emma Thompson gives the best with a character like nearly a Teresa May, but the script does not help too much.
Its intelligence consultants informs that, given the risk of a person who is in retirement, is at risk of all active spies.
And that means that Johnny English can walk as he can, now she is a teacher in a state-of-the-art place, but it is providing confidential classes on how to act as a hidden operative: there is a number of beautiful jokes where English offers a ‘School of Rock’.
English again takes them to the Whitehall for an emergency information meeting, and meets with his first membership Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is a married man now associated with an underwater commander, Vicki Pepperin loses a little in this style paper.
Therefore, in order to make sure things are worth mentioning in the Secret Service of Berrogain and in the action of Batman and Robin, meeting with the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylen.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, who is aware of the fact that he is aware of the fact that he is aware of the need to solve the pandemic in Great Britain, is the first minister to be a malicious vessel by Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their frying dishes: disguised as a waiter, they create chaos by concealing the luxury chain of Volta, and English stimulates the entire virtual reality scene when the house of Volta tries to see what it is like inside.
All stops are checked in to this last sequence, but although it is pleasant and relaxing, it has a lot of children’s TV.
This is the case.
And as in other films by Johnny English, I came to mind: Can British film industry give a paper that deserves its talent?
The Labour Party refused to work in a four-day week but is preparing a plan for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s radical Labour Party is studying a plan that the British predicts working for a week but five days.
It seems that the company’s main players would like to give people savings through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them a more festive day.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still carry the same salary home.
Sources have pointed out that the idea is ‘inclusive’ economic agenda and that the country wants to support its workers.
After four working days, he has been supported by the Union Congress as a way to benefit from the economy that is changing.
A High Court of Labour declared to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is planned before the end of the year.
• It will not take place one day, but a four-day week comes with the vision of the party’s economic recovery and the general industrial strategy.’
The Labour Party would not be the party supporting such an idea, as the Green Party defended four-day working weeks in the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, the aspiration has not yet been supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson stated that 'The four-day working week does not take into account the party's policy, and the party does not recognise that.'
The minister John McDonnell, who in the shadow, used the congress during the last week to define his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said, without a doubt, that managers and speculators should remove power in companies that offered public services.
In the plans of the shady Minister, the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their entire participation if a laborist government considers that there has been a wrong behavior.
It also confirmed that the incorporation of personnel in the management of companies and the creation of assets for 10 percent of private sector companies, with a cost of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say that "60 Minutes" could change their views or not
The study carried out by the FBI regarding accusations against Judge Brett Kavanagh has at least one year, and he has questioned whether the conclusions of the investigation could lead to the removal of their protection from a Republican Senator.
In an interview issued on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could make a change of their opinion.
Kennedy was more open than his party in South Carolina.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
When I said to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to the judge Kavanagh.
I called him after this, the argument has been revealed, I said, ‘Do you do that?’
He responded with firmness, clearly without a doubt."
Graham's votes, however, seem to be written on stone.
I have decided that he would suffer the accusation that he would cause a explosion in terms of Brett Kavanagh,” he said.
Mr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused with confidence,” added Graham, a reference to Christine Blasley Ford.
"And everyone who mentions him could not check this.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event with an incredible artist and a great mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
On this occasion, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the true objective of the event, i.e. extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, created in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international promotion group that hopes to increase the number of people actively fight against poverty.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you are not ready to pay a VIP ticket), those who want to go to the concert must perform a series of tasks or actions, such as sending an email to a leader in the world, making a phone call or in any other way that serves an increase in awareness of the purpose of poverty.
But what success has been achieved when Global Citizen is 12 years old to achieve its goal?
Is this original idea to encourage people to apply for an action through a free concert, or is another case that is called "clickivism", that is, that is, they are making a real change by signing an online application or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million of its followers’ “action” by making pressure to fulfil several purposes.
These actions have led global leaders to predict policies and commitments of more than 37 billion $ and these policies and commitments will have an impact on more than 2.5 billion people up to 2030 years.
In the beginning of 2018, the team mentioned the 390 commitments and forecasts derived from the actions, which have already been paid or received at least 10 trillion $.
As the group estimates, guaranteed funds have had a direct impact of 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments there is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and trainers committed to “to help children develop their full potential”, which has been based in the UK, has promised to donate $35 million to Romanian in order to eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
We will pass on the social injustice of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizen as your own," said in a live concert by Tracey Ullman on The Power of Nutrition in April 2018.
Furthermore, after more than 5,000 actions have been carried out, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children through actions linked to nutrition.
In response to this FAQ question on the website, “what makes you think that we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “The path will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, as the great movements against our civil rights and apartheid, we also get them stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janle Monae, among others, will be present at this year’s New York event, which will be attended by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the army as a "lock" to slow down the energy exports in Russia - an internal secretary
If necessary, Washington could use his army to prevent the arrival of the Russian energy, including in the Middle East, to report the internal secretary Ryan Zinke from the United States, Washington Examine.
According to Zinike, the relationship with Russia to Syria – as it’s evident that it’s in demand for legitimate governments – it’s just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I think they want to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, according to information.
And depending on the officer, there are ways and means to manage it.
"The United States, with our army, has the ability to ensure that the lines of the sea are open and, if necessary, block them in order to ensure that their energy is not reached the market," he said.
The members of an event, organised by the Power Alliance for Consumers, were talks to participants in an event organized by a non-profit group called “the voice of consumers’ energy”.
Washington compared the approaches to relate to Russia and Iran, in short, to clarify that they are the same.
The economic opportunity we have in terms of Iran and Russia is about to take advantage of and replace fuels”, he stated, referring to Russia as a “one-way economy” with dependency on fossil fuels.
Trump’s administration to promote its liquid natural gas export to Europe and Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers, have arrived in a replacement mission.
To this end, the administrative officials of Trump and the US President Donald Trump try to persuade Germany out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which makes it a “gab” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly highlighted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline for 11 million $, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubes, only for an economic project.
Kremlin says that its courageous attitude in the project is simply caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
I believe that we cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers after a meeting with the US energy secretary, Alexander Novaka, Russian energy minister Rick Perry in September.
The U.S. position has been negative for Germany and confirms its commitment to the project.
The German industry's leading organization, the German Confederation, in the EU's Energy Policy and in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow, requires the US not to enter into agreements.
"I have a serious problem when a third state hinders our supply of energy", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), Chancellor Angela Merkel, and President of Russia Vladimir Putin has recently held a meeting.
Elizabeth Warren's presentation of the "to examine it in depth" in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts said on a Saturday that he was going to “a deep” to present the presidential elections.
When he was in a city hall in Holyke, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would be going to study.
"There is time to get women to Washington and fix our broken government, which requires there to be a woman at the top, according to The Hill.
After the 6th of November, I will discuss the presentation of the candidate."
Warren expressed his opinion on Donald Trump at the City Council, stating that "the country was being carried out by the wrong way".
I am absolutely concerned with what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” he said.
Warren has clearly spoken of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanagh, in criticizing Trump and his candidate for the Court.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said: "It's clear, we need a FBI research before vote."
In any case, a survey published on Thursday has shown that most of the Warren voters do not believe they should submit their chairmanship in 2020.
About fifty percent of Massachusetts elected representatives said that Senators should not submit to the candidate, according to a survey carried out by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe.
Thirty percent, however, supported the presentation.
The possibility of the former Governor Dev Patrick has increased the support of the presenter, 38 percent who has supported a presentation and 48 percent against it.
Other names that appear in a possible presentation of 2020 include the Vice-president of Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said officially that he would decide for January, when he was announced by Associated Press.

arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
Because of what my son is suffering, when he is returning, I am identified with the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and other families suffering from the vulnerability of our soldiers,” said Donald Trump at Tulsa, Oklahoma.
According to Plin, "the arrest", he said about his son and other war veterans" "they return somewhat, they are returned to the hardened, if the other soldiers who are members of the army and all other army members have given the country to ask for such respect".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman as part of a declaration of having an armed violence in the home according to the police spokesperson of Dan Bennett.
18 states, D.C. support the implementation of the new asylum policy
The District of Columbia is supporting legal action with a new US policy that dens an asylum from the band of nineteen states and victims who are fleeing from domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 Members and Districts presented a respectful declaration to a Washington asylum and police officer, asserting that NBC News reported.
The full name of the petitioner Grace Day v. of the United States presented in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
He said that his partner "and its cellmen" had caused abuses of sex, but US officials refused the request of asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the state who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as they generate a large number of asylum applicants in the United States, because they are countries with a lot of problems related to flags and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy was a decision by the Immigration Scheme which allowed undocumented immigrants who were fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement by the Attorney General, Karl Racine Columbia, he said that "the new police leaves state, federation, and international law".
The federal law states that all asylum requests must be attributed based on the particular circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a bar counter-state violates this principle," warned a motherhood curiae.
In addition, lawyers argued that policy that denies immigration to the U.S. economy, they are more likely to turn it into entrepreneurship and offer them a “hand of work”.
The Chief Prosecutor's Office ordered the criminals to refuse to deliver more asylum from domestic violence and forced victims to flee the country's flag in June.
Asylum is available for those who are afraid to have their country as a persecution or to be a member of race, religion, nationality, or a social group or political opinion," said Simmons's policy on 11 June.
Asylum has never been able to solve all the problems people experience daily, despite the serious problems they face every day.

Ambassadors of the United States accused China “to attack” with propaganda ads
After a four-page announcement on which an official Chinese newspaper promoted the benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. ambassador has attributed Beijing to the American press to spread its propaganda.
Donald Trump United States President of China On the second day in Desies Register, Iowa, he mentioned an additional charge last Wednesday, after trying to enter the US Congress on 6 November, China denied accusation.
What had been accused of entering Beijing in the U.S. elections has been marked by Trump’s claims for the Reuters, a new campaign that was rising up for Washington to China’s pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are blocked at this time in a trade war that has now been increasing, each country has slays on the imports of others.
In the beginning of the war in China, Trump’s Republican Party supported Iowa’s exports as well as American experts.
Terry Branstad, ambassador of the USA and governor of Iowa for a long time, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Brands expressed in an article from Sunday's Des Moines Register, stating that "China is now strengthening its offensive by putting propaganda adversaries in our free press".
With the spread of propaganda, China’s government is making use of a strong tradition of free press and press freedom by placing advertisements on the Chinese government on the newspaper des Moines Register," he wrote.
On the other hand, in the press kiosk on the streets of Beijing, there is little dissenting voices and no real reflection about China’s economic career, as the media are subject to the strong control of China’s Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added, "a bid to publish his article by one of the most popular newspapers in China", but he did not say what newspaper was.
The republics violate women’s voters prior to the elections in central legislation with Kavanagh’s banishment, warning the analysts
Due to the fact that many high-level republicans are waiting for and defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanagh, the analysts have warned that they will have a decline among women in the elections of the next half of legislation.
The emotions around this issue have been very large, and most of the republics are already registered as they want to continue with the vote.
In those accounts, he said "is not possible to go back," in relation to an article published on the Saturday of The Hill at the Grant Rehe Syracyse University.
Referhe has said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will have enough pressure to support an investigation by the FBI to calm down existing voting voters.
"Women will not forget the fate - they will not forget tomorrow, and even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, the leading advisers and member of the progressive Moves On national side, Washington, D.C.
On the morning of Friday, the protesters shouted "they are protesting before the Senate" despite the fact that republics controlling the judicial commission had decided to continue with the name of Dr. Christine Blasy Ford, who said in Mic.
"The stability and motivation of the democrats will be off," said the independent political analyst Stu Rothberg.
It is said that people have already had a big impact, that is true.
But it could still have an impact, especially among women and young people who do not have a fixed vote, from 18 to 29 years old, often do not like the president.
Even before the candidate for the Supreme Court, Ford suggested that the analysis could continue with the resolution of the republics.
"It has become a great silence for the Republican Party", said Michael Steel, former president of the Spanish National Committee of the Republic at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
The account is not a vote of the vote, a final vote or a question of how Republicans have managed and treated this issue," explained the news channel's team director, Guy Cecil "Priorities USA".
In any case, the Americans seem to be fairly divided between the places of Ford and Kavanagh in order to decide what they believe in, but it seems that more people do it for the second.
A new survey of YouTube shows that 41% of those who have taken part believe in a secure or secure location in Ford, while 35 percent believe in a safe or secure location at Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said that Kavanagh has probably said in his statement, and 30% have said the same thing in terms of Ford.
Following the pressure of the flake, the FBI is currently researching the accusations made by Ford, as well as carrying out at least a few other accusoratives, by Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford, under the command of the Senate Standing Committee, declared that he was attacked at the time of 17 years.
Ramírez asserts that the candidate of the Supreme Court showed the officers as they were in a party in Yale in the 1980s.
The one who invented the World Wide Web intends to launch a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to launch a startup that seeks to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project is an enterprise based on the loose software platform of Irutp, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons may access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee worked on the task of "take the world around the world".
We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historical moment."
App uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “own data” or “POD” storage of their personal data.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of assignments, calendars, music repository and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: all are available in a single browser, and all together.
The personal data repository in online is a distinguishing feature of who can fully access the information of a specific type.
The company is called "feeding of people through data".
According to the Executive Director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes, and good skills to help put Solids available to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of employees working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers from all over the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Irupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team “not making a total change of their business models when they change with Facebook and Google.
"We are not asking for permission."
On Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote in a post published on Medium that "is a mission to provide a ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet World Wide Web Consortium to Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the last months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion on the neutrality of the network.
During its implementation, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
As for the next season on the Internet, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Consequence of the First World War Victoria Cross
They pay tribute to the only Greek clergy in England who received the veneration of the First World War for 100 years later, in his own town.
Bernard Vann won the award for the most important Lieutenant Colonel at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, a sniper died four days later, and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren displayed an honorary stone in a Kennedy parade in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Van, said that the stone was “very symbolic” to his grandfather and to show him 100 years later.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Van Gogh was led by Lieutenant Colonel Saint-Quentin of the Quín-go Canal by heading his battalion under the continuous fire of cannons and machine guns.
He then went to the first line of fire and, until he found a cannon that led him to the line, he himself alone, and threw him three times into the desert ground.
Lieutenant Colonel Van Van Gogh was killed by a German Lieutenant Colonel on October 4, 1918, shortly before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, aged 72, said he knew that his grandfather's actions could never do it, but that gives great humility."
She and her brothers, Dr. James Van, set a flower crown after the parade, leading the Royal Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and he added that "the support of many people can appreciate the courage of a real hero".
The fans of the MMA spent the night watching Bellator 206, but they put Peppa Pig instead
Let's say you give everything to look full of Bellato 206, and then don't let you see the main session.
The poster for San José had 13 fought among the six main calendars and was broadcast live at night in the UK, Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gerard Mousasi and Roy MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the UK's public would put them on stone and white when they moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised until the small hours in the morning for the fight.
A follower described it as a “single joke” for the living drawings of Twitter.
A government law says that this content was not suitable for the morning 6:00 and they had to change to the children’s programme," said Dave Schwartz, CEO of Bellator, who asked about the performance.
"Peppea small, "yet".
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Cook, said that they will analyze the program in the future to take into account the audience in the UK.
I believe that when I think of repetition, I can be sure that I can solve it," said Cook.
But the six men of Sunday morning are there, and we cannot solve it until Sunday, Monday, at their own time.
But we are working on solving it.
Believe me when the change made a bunch of messages forward and backwards, and all were not very pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I am commanding you that next will not happen again.
Instead of six clashes, as we usually do, we tried to offer more people and put them in the leg.
Unfortunately it's a situation that will happen."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley’s ‘executive’ regarding sex
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that she grew up in the minority on the other side of the sex, but that gave them the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said that he wasn't able to go to secondary school until he was "all like him."
When he spoke about the first Desert Island Discs presented by Radio 4, he said that he spoke to others about the rights of homosexuals.
He also said that being a parent had made it less important to make the Olympic Games.
The regular presenter of the program since time immemorial, Kisty Young, has received several months of vacation due to the disease.
After completely lost in Laplace's first program, Davey said that on the other side it was not allowed to "recommended" by the society as a child and as a girl.
He said: “So far, the feelings that feel underestimate and different on the other side have been the real reasons that have given me the power to succeed”.
As he wanted to prove, "some", he said, when he was aware of his sexuality he wanted to discredit people.
The sportsman who won two bronze medals in Olympic games has become a highly professional LGBT promoter and used the participation of the Australian Commonwealth Games to decentralize homosexuality.
He said he felt that he had given up his opinion that he was very lucky that he could have been living in an open way and that he wanted to give others a " hope".
The three-time champion of the world said that she had fallen with a man -the American movie Dustin Lance Black, who got to know ------- "he was caught with surprises".
She married the same year as a 20-year-old Oscar, but said that age difference has not been a problem among them.
He said that "When you are so young and have gone through so much things" - 14 at the age of his first went to the Olympic Games and his father died with cancer three years later with similar circumstances.
The couple became the son of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that she has changed her "full view".
If I had already asked him last year, "I had to win a gold medal" the only thing I had in my head," he said.
"And you know, there are more important things than gold medals in Olympic games.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after the diagnosis of mental cancer.
Stanley said that his father was not allowed to die, and he was one of the last things he asked: if they had already wanted to be in London for his first line of games in 2012.
I couldn't say, "You're not going to be in the first line," she said.
When he left his hand to breath, and let me breathe and I didn’t accept him until he died,” he said.
On the following day, Davey participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
I knew that this was what I dreamed of life: putting it in front of the local public, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first selection of songs -Proud, Heather Small-, which has identified him throughout the whole process of preparation of Olympic games and still has a silver accident.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
As Mikelson was not in shape, he stayed in the chair on Saturday at Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickey will make a record when he plays the 47th match of the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will have to improve his form to prevent bad appearance.
At the 2nd edition of the annual meeting, Jim Fury sent a chair to the captains four bullets and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of action, as it has often been in the United States, five times when it was time to break out the day’s main champion, with the hope of correcting the game.
It was never the most direct driver, nor the best time in his career, and the player from 48 years old is not the best option for the competitive dynamic of Le Golf National, who lost their reputation.
And even if the field does not fear him, in the ninth match, Mickelson, will face Francesco Molina open to the winner of the first four games of this week that met with the rook of Tommy Fleetwood.
When Americans start 12 individual games under four points, if they have a good start, they could be a decisive game of Mickey.
Fury showed confidence in his man because he couldn’t say much more.
"He had very well understood his role, he gave me a blow on his back, and told me that he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great trust in himself.
He is a cutting-edge athlete who has given to these groups a lot in the past and this week.
Surely I didn't see two games.
I hope more, but this has happened and we thought we had to play this way.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
Michelson beats the record for Nick Falda on Sunday as the player who has played the most matches for the Ryder Cup.
This may be the culmination of a professional career at the Ryder Cup that has never reached its individual brand again.
Mickelson wins 18 times, 18 times and he has lost seven times, but according to Furyk, he has brought something irresistible to the team.
She is shy and kind and often joked with people, and she is extraordinary to have her presence,” she said.
The young players have enjoyed playing against him a lot this week, and it has been fun to see.
It does much more things than you play."
The European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage they know can be immediate
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, is aware of the great advantage of the last day of the individual round of the day that despite the great amount of experience of the fact that the team may become a rivalry Cup easy.
Her debut in 1997 was in Valderejo, where her team had five points out against the Americans, but they won the tournament with a score of 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
I’m constantly reminding myself that we had a great advantage in Valderraman and got a lot of bad luck, and in Brooklin we also had a great advantage,” said Bjorn (in the picture), after the classes 5 and 3 win, and yesterday, 10 and 6 at the Le Golf National.
So history tells me and all the team that this has not yet ended.
We will act with all the encouragement tomorrow.
We go out to the ground and we will try to do everything well.
Nothing is decided until the points are on the board.
We aim to win the trophies and focus on it.
As I always said, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know well what it is: the best players in the world."
Bjorn also said: "I don't want to make any progress with the achievements that his players have made in a difficult golf field.
Tomorrow.
It's the turn of the individual tomorrow, and that's something else.
It’s great to be with a member when things go well, but when you’re alone, each golfer must prove his full ability.
This is precisely the message to the players: the best one you have come out of it tomorrow.
Now forget about your membership, because they must also take their best.”
Unlike Bjor, Jim Fury is about to play his own players better than his own teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three points.
Fury has also been on both sides of the last day’s course as a member of the Brooklyn winning team and, later, losing to the European team when the Europeans carried out the “Medine Miracle”.
I remember all the words I said,” said the Captain of 1999, when we asked Ben Crenshaw how he encouraged the players the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but from the beginning we want to keep the advantage, like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We have decided by this list of players, and tomorrow we are going to do a great job."
Thomas has a counter-attack in the final match against Harry McIlroy, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and other European high-order Europeans.
I have chosen this group in order that it is possible to complete the way," said Bjorn about the individuals selected.
Again they postponed the construction of the new German battle
The new German marina fragrant was required in 2014 to replace the old wartimes during the Cold War, but will not be built up until at least until the next year due to defective systems and the increasing cost of the media.
The request for the "Rhinland-Pfalz" (the first major vessel of the Baden-Weerttemberg class fragas) has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
In 2014 the ship was to be entered in marina, but the eleven problems after delivery have prevented it from carrying out this ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class applied by Marina in 2007 will replace the former Bremen test fragas.
It appears that a powerful cannon is capable of performing characteristics and secret actions against aircraft and ship missiles (e.g. low radar, infrared and acoustic signals).
In addition, it will also have a longer maintenance capacity: the most recent drugs can be maintained for two years outside the original ports.
However, due to the constant delays, warships with cutting-edge technology (the Germans aim to project their capacity) will be outdated when the service is entered, says the newspaper Die Zeit.
F125 fragas concluded with a lot of noise in their media, which was officially rejected by the German army, and returned to the Dutch Blomm & Vosssolar.
It was the first time that the marina returned to the shipyard after delivering it.
The reasons for the return were not known, but German media cited "software and hardware" errors, which led to the use of the battleship could be inaccessible.
Specially important software faults will be operated by 120 sailors, half of which run through the Bremen test.
In addition, the packaging has too much weight and, consequently, its performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult to add new features for the marina in the future.
The ‘Rehinland-Pfalz’ vessel weighs twice the classes used in the Second World War.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the whole project price (including crew training) is also a problem.
It is supposed to reach €3,100 million, from €2,200 you would have to pay at first.
Problems with new drugs are even more important when faced with warning that the German marina is reducing its capacity.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the marina’s “utility vessels are depleted”.
As the representative says, the problem has increased increasingly due to the lack of substitutes after the death of the old boats.
Not even one of Baden-Wuerttemberg's class fragaits in the marina.
The National Trust observes the secret life of the mouse
A new study has been carried out in a land of mountains in Scotland to learn how the batters use the landscape to find food.
More information about the behaviour of these special mammals is obtained in order to better determine their protection activities in the future.
The study conducted by Scottish National Trust (TSS) scientists will follow up on the nanocommons and soprano skills as well as the bass guitar and the lead vocals of Daubenton in the Inverew Gardens of Western Ross.
Special recordings will be made in key locations, and the activities that the mouse will carry out throughout the season will be monitored.
The UK’s health system (NHS) staff will also carry out mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts conduct the sound analysis of all the receptors, the frequency of the call of the mouse will be known, as well as the frequency of each species.
The map and report of the habitat will be followed to obtain a detailed picture of the landscape-scale of the apple behavior.
According to Rob Deware, a natural protection adviser at NTS, the most important areas of the habitat will be determined, as well as how each species are used.
Thanks to this information, the advantages of the treatment of the habitat will be determined, such as the generation of meadows and the conservation of forests for the batons and related species.
The Scottish and British sub- population struggled significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects the nests and loses their habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings also cause the danger, as well as the accumulation of flies, chemical treatments in construction materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind.
However, as they usually hunt at night, they are more useful than the ears when the prey is thrown down.
They use a sophisticated sound positioning technique to guess the costumes and obstacles in the flight path.
270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76.000 hectares of Scotland are the NTS organisation, which welcomes very seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly monitor the observations, the examination of the nests, and sometimes the rescues.
In fact, the organization has created a first and only sovereign reserve in Scotland, in the district of Dumfries and Threeaway, where eight species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the owner of the plot, says that it is the perfect land for them.
"We have a great field for the sister," she said.
We have “old buildings and many years of trees, it is very suitable for habitat.
However, many things are still unknown about the mouse, so thanks to the work we do here and other lands, we understand what they need to be healthy."
Thompson notes that it is very important to check the absence of a mouse before performing the maintenance tasks, as if only a maternity nest is abandoned, 400 females and females can die, and so the entire local population may disappear.
The bats are protected by the protected species, and it is illegal to kill, haras or disturb them, as well as their nesting.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representing the body of protection of the mouse, asks for help from the general population.
He said: “We still need to learn a lot of things about the bats and we don’t know how many of the species we live with us.”
Ronaldo abandons the accusations while his lawyers are prosecuted for the German magazine
The accusations against her are “false news” by Cristiano Ronaldo and those who have done it by their name only want to “publicisation”.
His lawyers are preparing a German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which has published a report.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker Kathy Mayorga was accused of rapping an American woman named in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he thought he paid 35,000 $ for keeping an incident secret, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Shortly after the release of the accusation, he has made a live Instagram video for 142 millionaires of Ronaldo’s aged 33 in the platform, where accusations say “false news”.
"No, no, no, and not.
Today they are fake news,” said the footballer who won the Golden ball five times in front of the camera.
They want to achieve advertising by means of my name.
It is normal.
They want to get popularity by saying my name, but this is usually done in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing Der Spiegel for accusations, which are supposed to be "republication of suspects that affect privacy".
Christian Schertz said that as far as the player is concerned with the “deceiving crime of violations” of personal rights, in the last few years.
The supposed event took place in June 2009 in a hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, he considers that he moved to the room of the player Ronaldo and Mayor, where he broke from the corner, saying that he had been in the departmental documents from the Clark County district of Nevada.
Mayorg pointed out that Ronaldo had been put into the knee after the supposed event and that he was saying that he was “good man in 99 percent”, but that he failed in a percentage.”
Documents indicate that the couple had sexual intercourse, but the relationship was allowed.
Mayorg also said that he had taken pictures of his wounds in the hospital, but later, he came to an external agreement because “the repression of the reprisals”, and that he was concerned with being “publicly humiliated”.
As a woman of 34 years of age, she wants to reverse the agreement because she continues traumatized because of the supposed fact.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and in the summer he moved to a great Italian Juve group, due to an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: the UK “will regretting a definitive regret” car manufacturers
Having the UK’s leading self-makers, Gregory Clark, said that after "Brexit", he tells the business secrets.
It has also said that "refunct" to the BBC that the UK will stop the production of the factory of the UK with no agreement on the European Union, in the area of Burston (in the Derby).
We need a deal," said Clarke.
The Japanese automaker says that the delay in a “Brexit” resulting from an agreement could lead to the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burston (which manufactured by Toyota Avisen vehicle) produced almost 150,000 cars a year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
If the UK doesn’t leave without an agreement at the end of March, our factory production will stop,” said Mr. Marvin Cook, Director of Toyota.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also stated that they are not afraid of how trade between the European Union will work without an agreement.
BMW has said, for example, that after Brexit, will close its Mini factory for a month.
The main concern for car manufacturers is the risks associated with the supply chain if the "Brexit" has been carried out without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line is “time” and parts reach every 37 minutes, both from UK and European Union suppliers, when requested.
If the United Kingdom comes out of the European Union without an agreement on the 29th of March, it could be interrupted by borders and therefore by delays and parts deficiency.
It would not be possible to store an inventory of more than one day for Toyota in the Derby factory, which would require production to be stopped.
Clark said that the plan for the future contact of the European Union is “Chquers” specifically designed to avoid these customs studies.
”It is necessary to have a deal, we want the best deal, not only to ensure the success of the moment, but also to make it possible for the future,” said the BBC Radio 4 program.
In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have shown that it is essential to follow very successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot indicate how long the production will be stopped, but in the long term, additional costs would be reduced due to the competitiveness of the factory and, consequently, the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsudoularis, coordinator of the union Unit for 24 years, has said that the members are increasingly concerned: “I haven’t gained experience in the absence of these jobs.
A government spokesperson said: "We presented a detailed and credible plan for the future relations with the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosens might be postponed again, according to the White House
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Rosenstein’s general substitute for “one week may be postponed”, as the case of the candidate for the Court of King Robert Kavanaugh has already said on Sunday.
Robert Mueller is overseeing the work of his special advisor, Rosenstein, the influence of Russia in the U.S. elections, the connection between Trump’s assistant and Russians, and is researching the supposedly impoccupation of justice held by President Mueller.
Trump has released a general tax replacement and will not compromise with the independence of Muelle in the last months.
During the previous month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had created a secret microphone for recording his conversations with Trump, as well as removal of the president from the United States by article 25 of the constitution.
Rosenstein cancels the information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House while information that he would resign was released.
Instead, he pointed out that at the time he would have a meeting with Trump on Thursdays at the United Nations in New York.
Trump says he prefers not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting has been delayed for not being a conflict with the Senate’s judicial power committee; in that commission, one of the women who has been accused of making the sex, Christine Blasy Ford, was tested.
On Friday, a one-week study was asked by Trump to investigate accusations against the FBI to do so, which is why the Senate vote has been delayed.
The press-secretary of Trump was released on Sunday in the Sarah Sanders Fox News.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “There is still no date; it may be a week, but I would understand that it would be delayed another week, taking into account everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
However, we will see that I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists will not agree with this statement: in fact, Sanders has not issued a press conference in White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
According to Sanders, the lack of press conferences has not been the "greater" journalists, but he said: "I agree that they are corrupt."
He then suggests that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes much more sessions than his predecessors," he said, and he added, "We have checked these statistics."
Sandra has said that they will continue to press, but "If the press has the possibility of asking the president of the United States, this is much better than ask me.
We often try to do that, and you have seen that we have done it many times, and this will replace the press when we allow us to talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when he comes out of the White House, where he participates in open sessions, or in the press conferences that are held when he/she visits the dignatians.
He does not usually do the press on his own.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the U.S. president during this week in New York, when he made a significant and significant appearance in the journalists he met.
The UK Health Department has written a letter to European Union employees who work in the NHS in Scotland due to the concerns regarding “Brexit”.
The Health Department’s Secretacies have written to European Union employees who work in the Scottish health system to thank them all over the country and ask them to stay there after the Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament, Jean Freeman, the Parliament of Scotland, wrote that there are less than six months left from the United Kingdom.
The government of Scotland has already agreed to assume the cost of applications for the European Union’s citizens who work in public services.
Freeman has said in his letter: during the summer, negotiations on "Brexit" has progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and it is expected to make a decision for autumn.
However, the UK government has increased the preparation for a possible untreated exit.
I know that time is so urgent for you.
That’s why I would like to confirm that I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
The European Union’s colleagues, as well as those from there, attract experience and useful skills, and improve the work of the health service to the benefit of patients and the communities that we serve.
Scotland is your home without any doubt and we hope to stay with us.”
They have operated on emergency after suffering a wound in the head of Christion Abercrombie
After suffering a wound on Saturday 31 and 27 losing to Vanderbilt Komodores, he was reported by the Tensensian Mike Organ.
As the manager of Rod Reed Tennessee, the player has suffered a little before the middle of the game.
He has approached the side band and lost consciousness," said Reed.
The coach and the medical personnel have been given oxygen in the band itself and have been taken in a tablet to make a thorough medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State Group has told Chris Harris from the WSMV network that it has been extracted from the operation of the WSMV chain, and that he is in the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris said that "they haven't given any details about the type of wound or its severity", and they try to determine when the wound occurred in the State Tennessee.
It is in its second year with the red-and-whiteberry jersey and its first season has been transferred from Tennessee State Illinois.
He made five plaques on Saturday before leaving the game, with a total of 18 plaques per season.
Buyers will have to pay a higher price on the pitch when they buy bonuses in the UK
Buyers will have to pay a higher price on the tavern when they buy bonuses in the UK, and this amount will be used to assist people who have not been left out with the Conservative Party's plans.
This strategy aims to assess the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
In the United Kingdom, the increase in fees for non-contributory taxpayers
The public treasure believes that there will be a total of £120 million per year for the help of non-existent houses
Buyers will have to pay a higher price on the TV bench when they buy bonuses in the UK, and the additional amount will be used to help those who have not been stopped without their houses, as they said today.
This strategy aims to demonstrate the success that Corbyn has had to attract young voters, offering affordable homes and receiving more income.
In the UK, the increase in fees for people and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK will be used to reduce the number of people who sleep on the street.
In addition, which is an additional tax on the current pitch (including top-level taxes for the second houses included and rented property in two years ago), it can reach up to three percent.
In the public treasure estimates that there will be a total of £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the works built in London are bought in the UK, so prices increase and more difficult for those who want to buy them for the first time are included in the residential market.
The rich areas of the country, especially those of the capital, have become “mothers”, since foreign buyers usually spend most of their time out of the city.
This new policy comes after the request of Boris Johnson to help young people buy their first home after they have made a request for reducing the fat tax on the tavern.
In order to maintain the prices of the plots without having to buy and use them, Mayi has asked him to abandon the cost of a reasonable price of homes to solve the "life crisis" in Great Britain.
Corbyn has presented, on the other hand, some attractive reforms in the area of housing, such as rental control and evictions without reason.
In addition, it aims to provide city councils with more potential to build more homes.
This is what May said: "I was going to dedicate my courage to the British dream to the recovery of each new generation.
This means solving the corrupt housing market.
British doors will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their life.
However, being as easy as for people who are not living in the UK and for foreign businesses is not just a way to buy homes as long as they work hard for the British.
For too many people, the dream of belonging to a home has been too far, and the dignity that they have to sleep on the street is still here."
Jack Ross: “It’s my greatest desire to be a coach in Scotland”
The head of Jack Ross Sunduland states that at one point his "greatest of us" being a coach in Scotland.
A 42-year-old Scottish club is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, located in the third position of the League One, three points from the first position.
This summer, he came to the Stadium of Light, after his return to St Mir's Premiere in Scotland.
I wanted to act as a player for my country.
I won a B League trophies, and that was what Ross has said in the EU’s Sport Sound program.
But since I was little I saw the Scottish matches with my father Hampen, and I have always wanted to return.
However, if I had the ability to handle the club only I had the option."
Among the managers of Sunduland, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canoio, were there.
According to the ex-president of Alla Athletic, he did not feel nervous by coming out of the great names, since he refused to give classes to Barnsley and Ipwich Town.
To measure success, I will have to ask myself, “Can I return the club to Premier League?”
Given the club’s structure and facilities, he certainly needs to be in the Premier League”.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, as a volunteer assistant in Dumbarton and one of Hearts training staff after 15 months.
He then helped the team to go down to the third level and, thanks to him, he became a champion in the fall of St Mir on the next season.
Ross now says that it feels more comfortable than when Clyde, Hartepool, Falkirk, St Mir and Hamilton Academic.
It was a real crossroads for me, perhaps,” he said about taking responsibility for the area.
"I really thought it was being a manager the best thing for me than to be a player.
It is curious to say this, because I was a good player, I had a good life, and I lived some important moments of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have many things to eat every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of my work, but I am pleased as a coach.
I have always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable than ever on my skin."
The whole interview will be held on Sunday 30 September at the Radio Scotland radio station, from 12:00 to 13:00 (BST)
The five and half of the Saturday is the perfect time to take a drink according to a survey
Thanks to the summer heat waves, the British public income has increased, but pressure has increased for the restaurant chains.
The sale of pubs and bar chains has increased by 2.7% per cent, while the restaurant is estimated to drop 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, who has collected the data in the CGA business advisory, says that “the sun has always been playing and that the England team has kept more than expected in the World Football Championship, similar data from July to June, where the revenue in pubs has increased by 2.8%, but more restaurants have lowered.
Even though the sales of restaurants have decreased by 1.8, they have been even worse in July.
The pubs and bars specializing in the drinks have had much better performance, and the restaurant sales drop has been higher than it has.
The pubs specialising in food have also suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people only want to take a drink.
The sales of pubs and bars have increased by 6.6 per cent in the last month, whereas the food goes down 3 percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trends we saw at the end of April.
The weather and the effects of social events and sport are the most important factors in the sale of domestic trade.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains have economic status and have an annual discount of 4.8 percent of sales will lead to significant damage, as well as continuing pressures around the cost.
The long and hot summer comes in an unbeatable time for those establishments who specialize in food, and is going to see if the moderate temperatures in August will be relaxing."
The increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened establishment, has been around 2.7 percent in July, with chain expansion being slowed.
The coffee maker, in relation to the shops of the United Kingdom, bars and restaurants, has collected and analyzed the performance data of 47 operators, along with an income of €9 million, which is recognised as a point of reference in the sector.
Five children have accounts hidden from their parents on social media
One of the five children (at the age of 11) hides their parents and teachers in social networks according to a survey
In a survey carried out by 20,000 students in secondary education, the “false accounts of the Instagram” has been seen
For this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has been increased
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they can see from their parents
But one of the five children (as young as 11 years old) have accounts hidden from adults on social networks.
In a survey carried out by 20,000 students in secondary education, the “Tastero false accounts” has been shown (this is the Instagram website to share photos).
For this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has been increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they can see from their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother found his 13-year-old daughter's secret site without wanting, where a teenager called "bear me."
This study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and independent schools (HMC) has led to the emergence of two 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 and half of them have private accounts.
According to Mike Buchan, Head of HMC: "There is worry that adolescents have a temptation to create online secret spaces that they cannot find their parents and teachers."
Eidh Doyle will be a “athletics spokesperson” at the Scottish Athletics committee
Eilidh Doyle was appointed director of the Scottish athletics committee at the general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most awarded athlete in Scotland, and the director of Ian Beattie has said that they have an excellent opportunity to share their sporting experience in the last decade.
Eilidh has a strong respect for Scotland, UK, and worldwide athletics community, and we know that it will be very useful for Scotland’s athletics," says Beatriz.
Doyle said: "I like to be a lawyer of the athletes, and hope I will do a great deal of contribution, and for playing sports in Scotland."
The American won the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games in a total of 200 to 400 metres and has four gold medals. It is a BBC siter who has recently lost their ability to walk due to a dramatic shock absorber.
He wrote this on Twitter: “I had a month ago, I had an influx.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was going to be ready to see whether I was going to restore or to what level.
It has been very hard, but I have completely restored it, I have had to learn it again and I have been doing skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages you have sent me to give you encouragement!"
An ad adverting a milk that marks mother with cows creates unusual views on the Internet
A milking company has created contrasting opinions on the internet compared to the cow filled with breast donors.
The company Elvie, dedicated to the consumer technology, has published a joke on a video to show the freedom of the milk of the new devices.
They dance in a stable with four simple women, who are truly mother, and with a song similar to: "Yes, I put on my head, but I haven't met" and "You may not realize, but these are nothing but my figures."
The slogan is: "Take milk, milk, give it to the little ones, take it out, milk, milk, milk, milk, I'm milk."
However, this announcement published by the company on the Facebook page has generated a debate on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has created a lot of reactions in the viewers, many have said that it does not take seriously the “difficiencies” of the dairy industry.
The use of cows has been very bad for advertising of this product.
Like us, they also have to stop and give birth to milk, but they steal their offspring a few days after their birth,” said a user.
Elvisi can enter discretely on one of the breasts in the breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another person has said: "It is very traumatic, of course, for mother and child.
But let’s go, why not use it to advertise a milk extraction that does not remove children?
He added this to someone: “This ad has no hearing.”
Others, however, have defended the ad; a woman has acknowledged it as “a way of laughing”."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still would give him a chest, I would buy one.
When I got out of the milk I felt like I was a cow.
The ad is somewhat crazy, but that is his goal.
It is an excellent product," wrote a user.
Another commented: “It is fun to say, to the mother who brings milk (often they must do it in their workplace or common) because they feel like “the cows”.
He does not aim to praise or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have danced to make milk in their chest.
Many women who produce milk are considered to be like cattle in the campaign.
The milk mating is completely silent, and does not have a cable or tube. It can be pulled discretely on one of the breasts to move as many women as they want to be in their arms or can go out to the street.
An executive partner and director of Ana Balarin Mother commented: "The milk-take is a very revolutionary product, requiring a bold and provocative presentation.
With this equality between women and dairy cow, we wanted to highlight the milk extraction process and all its challenges, as well as the freedom of milk that comes out in a entertaining and nearby way.
It is not the first time that Elvie has attracted attention.
During the London Fashion week, a mother with two children appeared in a corridor for the designer Marta Jabowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of children have been silently taken to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detected has increased in recent times, although less care per month has been the same, one of which is why, due to the fact that the death of Trump’s administration has been hard and difficult for the children to take refuge.
Until now, the majority of the sponsors have been the same, but now they are afraid of registering for the children, they could lose their capacity to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities said that those who wanted to support the sponsors and those who lived in their home had to send their children, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alben, one of the U.S. official immigration and customs security officers, claimed that tens of people were arrested for protection against minors without an adult.
This agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them had no criminal record.
"There are almost 80 percent of the sponsors or those who live in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to detect them," said Albin.
In order to accelerate the progressive processing of the situation of children, the officials have created new rules that, according to them, must appear within one month after they are detected and not as before 60 days of refuge in the court.
Many of them will be shown in a video conference call to request the legal status of a immigration judge.
If you decide not to receive the help, they will be removed immediately.
The more time the child passes in care centres, the more likely to increase their anxiety and depression, which means that there may be attacks or attempts to escape depending on the staff of the refuge and in the last months.
The children’s defenders say that these concerns are increased in large facilities such as Tornillo, as they are so much to prevent them from seeing the problems of the children.
They have also said that if the children are taken to the camp camp camp area for emotionally preparation or to say goodbye to friends, they can already increase their trauma.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of the "couperators" of the United States, France and Turkey
In the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moalem, has also called for the return of Syrian refugees at home, although the country's war was during its eighth year.
The alternative to the first Minister has also said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian territory, under the excuse of combating terrorism, and that they will be treated as “right”.
They must be taken out of the territory with no conditions,” he said on the board.
Moualem has said that the war against terrorism has hardly ended in Syria; 350,000 people have been killed in that war since 2011, and millions of people have left their homes.
Damascus has said that “we will continue to fight in the sacred battle” from the terrorist groups as well as “legally foreign presence”.
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mostly in the preparation and advice of Kurdish forces against Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Arabs.
France, on the other hand, has 1,000 soldiers on the country's ground that has destroyed the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moulem has stated that there are adequate conditions to return them, and he has attributed it to some “reliable” countries that encourage refugees to stop them out.
We call on "for international community and humanitarian organisations for these returns," he said.
"There is nothing more than humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warn that aid to Syria will not be given until they reach a political agreement to end the war of Assad.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have signed an agreement to create a protective field for the rebels in their last fortress, which is an opportunity to promote political dialogue in the United Nations.
This large-scale offensive between Russia and Turkey meant that Syrian aided three million inhabitants could be carried out in this province.
However, Moualem has said that the agreement will have clear “times” and that the military action will aim to be the yihadists, including the fights of the Northern Front in relation to Al-Qaeda, which will be “destructed”.
The U.S. Army hopes that the first meetings of the new Assembly will soon be held between the members of the government and the opposition to the constitution of a post-war constitution and the start of an electoral process.
Moualem has established a series of conditions that the Syrian government has to participate in this meeting, saying that the work of the Assembly must be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warning that no other one should enter.
Why Trump wins for the second time
Following this logic, Trump will win the retake in 2020 if (as expected by many democratists) a bankruptcy process or scandals do not end their president.
That would be the "The end of a Presidency!"
For now, it does not seem that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the audience at the majority of the viewers has been almost doubled until they reach 1.55 million spectators and tripled the MSNBC string up to 1.6 million.
Fox News also has a total of 2.4 million spectators in this schedule, which has increased over four years, according to data from the company Nielsen. The R Rachel Madow Show has been the largest television viewers on the MSBC chain, and has been able to get up to 3.5 million spectators on the night of the major news.
It is a kind of fire that attracts people, because we want to understand what happens," says Neal Barre, the director of the “Designed survivor” in the ABC chain, who, after abolishing the Capitol, is about a governing cabinet becoming president.

There is also time for entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, the stories coming from Washington to the future of abortion law, the families of immigrants can come together again and decide the health of the global economy.
Only high-profile audiences have the opportunity to disconnect.
However, if you spend six hours more on the subject of a series of articles, it is worth six hours that Bob Woodward has used his book “sold background” in writing, the book “Fear”, written by Paul Manafor, which tells the story of the 155,000 billboards, and Stormy Daniels describes as “Anatomica” by Trump.
I, at least, will not look at the same way back to Super Mario.
The executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of the “Pawn Stars” show the story about Trump’s changing plot characters and the changing plot (like the national football league), Kim Jong-on-on-one gives a feeling of having a “reality show”, something to consume every day.

The external money bar is entering the most voted semi-relegislative elections of the Congress
It is not surprising that the bar is entering the exhibition in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, since the congress districts have been reorganised, so they are competing for the same chair.
The frontiers are represented by the "Conor Lamb" of the democratic party that has recently rewritten by Pittsburg, whose chair was awarded in special elections for another district.
Lamb has another title, specifically, Keith Rothfus, in the Republican district, who represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is saturated with the 17th district.
In January, the High Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the constitutional boundaries of the District were tampered against the republicans, which led to the proper destitute constraints of the maps.
This new joint competition has led to a close campaign financing competition in the main financing sources: the congress committee of the democratic campaign (DC) and the national commission of the Republican campaign (NRC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania for having won the 18th Congress Congress in March in Pennsylvania.
The chair was from a republic in the last decade and the president of Donald Trump won the award with 20 points.
In the words of political enemies, Democrats have a little advantage.
The US considers El Salvador to be in favour of China, but later pushes him back
The diplomats have already pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already been recognized to Beijing, where Washington almost did not ask for it to go back.
Trump had a close meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and was the owner of a hotel in Panama, until the members of the Trump decided to join the management team.
The official head of state department decided to withdraw from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, following the new decision-makings of the department, on a month’s declaration by Heather Nauter, who claims to be a member of the department.
However, sanctions were only considered to be against El Salvador, who received $140 million as support from the United States in 2017 to control the traffic of narcotics, promote development and contribute to the economy.
Among the proposed punishments are economic aid reductions and specific visa restrictions, which would be very harmful to Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the inner meetings progressed, the American and Central American officers delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, aiming to end the waiting year after a similar meeting in order to avoid immigrants from the United States.
However, in mid-September, the administration officials refused to hold a conference that led to El Salvador's refusal to establish sanctions.
The vice-president Mike Penence is expected to take part in the conference that has changed the middle of October, which is a sign of the importance of the Administration to the meeting, according to the diplomats.
Three armed men have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any messages or punishments in Washington.
Bolton's White House voted to make statements on the details given by a vote by three official voters, including two official ones, which were to keep anonymity that they agreed to report internal debates.

Learn history
Soon, the report by the prosecutor Robert Muelle will soon be released, indicating that Trump has prevented justice, as there is a lot of evidence in public view.
He is also researching the Trump campaign in the US election.
If the majority of the Congress changes, Trump will have to give instructions to the voter (and, if necessary, to present it before a jury of judges of the same fate).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I don’t mean that Trump is a decline of it, nor that he is the European equivalent to Trump.
We need to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to build a coup against Hitler, with the Western countries holding them back to Munich and supporting Czech-speaking people.
We failed and lost the chance to avoid the slaughter of the later years.
We have plagued history with such turning points, which make it possible to accelerate or delay the inevitable progress of democracy.
The Americans are at this time faced with such turning points.
What will we do if Trump hires a general prosecutor with Rosen? Rosensten is precisely the one who controls what will happen with the investigation of Muelle.
Rosenstein’s job has been in danger since last year when this newspaper was announced that he thought of re-confirming the president and stating that he was unfit to him.
Rosenstein says that the article mentioned by The Times is not correct.
"How will we respond if the investigation has been requested by the FBI if it is not complete or fair, or if it receives confirmation of being a judge of the Supreme Court, even if it has been dismissed to him as opposed to the accusations of sexual attacks and false evidence?
And, above all, will we vote for Trump’s responsibility in the semi-legilative elections as a Congress?
If we do not exceed these tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.
However, I really think we will be overcome by teaching me in Prague.
Our mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and the same Nazi regime to occupy my embassy in Auschwitz.

Graham Dorrans feel optimistic against Rapid Vienna in front of the match
Rapid Vienna will host the Rangers Thursday, although the Austrians know that a few weeks later, after a draw with the Spanish Villarreal, they will remain in the perfect position to qualify for the European League G team.
Graham Dorrans was unable to make his first appearance on the knees until the 2nd and a 2nd draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a trap for better things.
This was a good result, as it is a good rival to Villarreal,” said the player of 31 years.
We tried to get something and finished achieving a point.
Maybe we could have the chance to win at the end, but it is a draw result if necessary.
In the first half they prevailed and in the second half we were the main one.
Thursday night will be very important for the European Championship.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they had a good result in the final game, however, the audience is on our side and I want to go forward and get a positive result.
The last year was difficult, I had injuries and there was a change in the club itself, but at the time there was a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying a lot of training too.
I'm going forward because we're going to forget for the previous season and get the success."
Women are very concerned due to a problem related to savings in their retirement
The participants in the survey wanted to be careful, but very few have reported their family members.
The half of the participants in the study of the Nationwide has said that she has spoken about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent of him talked about it with his children.
We’d like to wait for one of the family members, but we don’t dare to ask for it,” said Holly Snyder, president of the National Insurance Company.
Here is the first steps.
Talk to husband or wife: family will not be ready to take care of you first if you don't require it.
Collaborate with a consultant and your family in order to decide where and how to receive them, because the cost of care depends on them.
Request assistance from a consultant: an adviser can help you find the way you pay for these expenses.
You have more than one long-term surveillance option, such as a traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for the expenses of the care, and at the same time you can pay with your money if you have that money.
Clear legal documents: forget legal issues.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health, as well as ensure that you are not able to apply for them.
Also ask a lawyer to finance your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial opportunities on your behalf and ensure that you pay the bills when you are not able to do so.
Do not forget that parents are elderly and one of them has a medical emergency and they are on their way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 334 people have died on Friday due to the earthquake and strong tsunami in Indonesia and the number of deaths by the agents.
Due to the cutness of the communication systems, relief agents could not obtain the information from the Dongga Government, which is the closest area to the 7.5 magnitude epicenter in the north of Palau.
In the evening, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are important information about the city of Palau and the Dongga Government in the island of Sulaweseis:
Palau is the capital of the province of Sulawesei, and is located at the end of a narrow coastal bay on the island of Sulawesei, which was populated by around 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.

The federal prosecution wants a special death penalty for the suspicion of the terrorist attack in New York
The New York federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a dangerous terrorist in the city of New York, which was the last time to be sentenced to a federal crime in 1953.
As a result, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental truck at Home Depot for the attack on West Side Highway in the South, before carrying all of the pedestrians and bicycles.
To justify the death verdict, Saipov must show that he killed the eight people “ intentionally” and that he was severely wounded by several people, according to the death penalty notice presented in the South District of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible to establish a death penalty in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal court was attributed to Saipov, amongst other reasons, eight members of parliament who are usually employed by the federal prosecution in cases of organized crime and a commission of violence and destruction by motor vehicles.
The prosecution said that it should be “planned and planned” because Saipov made it “cruderious” and described it.
The actions of the Sayfullo Habiblaevic Sapov were to cause injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccico, whose statement was presented with the aid.
Five of the victims were Argentinean tourists.
A decade later, the District of New York has ruled a death penalty for the last time.
The murder of two drug providers, Khalid Barnes, was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In a federal case in New York, the death penalty was established in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were granted a conspiracy to the Soviet Union during the two-year Cold War.
Rosenberg was sent to the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to legal documents, the U.S. U.S. government did not show any compensation for the attack after the attack on the days and months.
The police said that it was not bad for the researchers to say that it was not done.
According to the report, the attack on the mobile carrier told the authorities that ISIS video had been seen.
In the case of the police, he asked for the flag of ISIS in the hospital room.
Regarding the report of 22 crime, he declared that he is innocent.
David Patton, who is the one of the federal police officers responsible for representing Saipov, said they had taken a “great discontent” with the fiscal decision.
We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty only to those who have been affected by this fact, “We think that it will be possible to free it instead of accepting the curvy for the loss of life,” said Patton.
Saipov’s defensive team urged the prosecutor not to demand death penalty.
A Parliamentary Party says that NIGE FARAGE should be responsible for negotiations about Brexit
Nigel Farage has promised to “move the army of the people” today in the protest of the Conservative Party.
The former leader of the UKPI has said that politicians must “ feel the heat” of the Euroeptics, and Thesa May’s Parliament has proposed this to negotiate with the EU.
The Conservative Parliament Peter Bone explained to the members of the march in Birmingham, if the UK was already a secretary of ".
However, the Conservatives have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, highlighting the challenge of Mrs Maye's rivals: the fully-distributed queues.
The Prime Minister is trying to move forward with the Chequers commitment plans, but meanwhile he is suffering from Brexit, supporters and EU attacks.
The Allies believe that it will advance and attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels irrespective of the possible implications, and that the euro-sceptical and labour force must decide between its offer or chaos.
Mr. Bone, who presented to the participants of the Leaves Leaves Leave in Solihl, aims to “Chquers”.
He also stated that he had to collaborate with Mr Farage and that he was responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
If it was the manager, we would be outside,” he said.
The Parliament of the Wellingborough party added: “I will defend the Brexit, but we must call on Chequers”.
In contrast to the EU, he said: “We were not fought in the wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our laws, our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the public opinion since the 2016 vote: “The British intention has been to change the idea and stay it is simply a lie”.
Andrea Jenners, a member of the conservative party and a member of Brexit, also went on to inform the informers of: "I am only the first minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequeurs is not popular among citizens, opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be known among our members, nor by our activists who break the streets and make elections possible.
Stop listening to Chequers and start listening.”
In response to Mrs May, he added: “The first ministers must maintain their word in order to continue working.
According to the people who participated in the demonstration, the politicians must “ feel the heat” need to betray the decision made in the referendum of 2016.
Now, this is a question of trust between our people and our political class,” he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to let them know, “we will not leave them with them”.
In direct to the public full of enthusiasm, he added: “I want you to feel warm to our political class where Brexit is to betray.
We are militarising the citizen’s army that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud.”
Meanwhile, the supporters of the stay travelled through Birmingham before a two-hour protest in the centre of the city.
A few activists raised the posters against Brexit after a group lunch this weekend.
His colleague, Adonis lord, laughed to the conservatives at the beginning of the conference due to security problems.
They are the people who tell us that ICT systems can function properly, and in Ireland the full technology of Canada plus chain, the unmanned, unrestricted, free trade,” added.
It’s a lie.
There’s no good Brexit”, he added.
Warren will study the opportunity to become a candidate for the “great attention”
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that he will study the possibility of becoming a candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe newspaper reported that Massachusetts's Democratic Party spoke about his future at the Massachusetts City Hall on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticised by President Donald Trump, will be elected again in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative of the Republican Party; he was vice president of the Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
It is said that taking place on Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, the event took place in Holyke, where Trump held the 36th meeting with his friends in the town hall.
A participant asked whether he would be a president.
As Warren responded, "the woman responded to Washington to fix our broken government, which means that a woman must be in command".
They have arrested a suspicious crime for the murder of Sims from the University of Louisiana State
He was arrested on Saturday in Baton Rouge ( Louisiana) for the shoot that killed a suspicious person on Friday, after the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims of the University of Louisiana.
At 11:00 a.m. (Easttime) the Police Department of BATH reported the arrest process of Dyton Simpson was 20 years old.
Previously, he opened the video of the Friday shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who appeared on it.

Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after winning the Donosti Vettel
It was clear that on Saturday Valtteri Bottas Lewis Hamilton would have died or lived in the race from his team's own classification.
From the beginning, Botta was very beautiful and he almost chased Hamilton into defending his place in the first two, and invited his team to attack Vettel.
He entered Vettel first into the box, and Hamilton had to join the final block, which would have a direct impact on the race.
Mercedes became a boxing tour later, but after a clash, Hamilton took up the front-off match because he freed the driver of the broker to hold the third corner after a double movement to defend it.
On that day, Max Verstappen began his career in the last row of the departure grill, culminating in the seventh place.
Then it remained in the first position in a large part of the race and at the end it was held to finish the race quickly and get the fourth place in Kii Raikkon.
Finally, he joined the box twice on the 44th tour, but he was unable to live on the eight spins, and Raikkon won the fourth place.
It’s not a simple day; Valtteri has done a great job throughout the weekend, and he’s really honest.
The team has done a great job in the match,” said Hamilton.
They were inappropriate gestures
President Donald Trump laughed in a protest that he held on Saturday with his wife, the candidate of the Supreme Court, Frederick Blaney Ford, who claimed sexual assaults him.
When Virginia spoke in West, the president did not have direct reference to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Judicial Commission, he said instead that the people who are acting in the Senate are “false and greedy”.
‘The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the last days, that you see the anger, that you see people who are angry, that they see it is evil, false, and liar,” said.
“You see the publications and the leaking and they say, “Oh I’m not.
I haven't been.”
Do you remember?
Did you get a letter to Deane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? Do you trust the letter? “Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not leaked.”
Well, wait a minute.
Did we get the letter that we have stolen? No, we don’t get it leaked,” he added, imitating the reaction of the Senator.
Ford sent a letter to Finestein in July where he reported the details of the appeals against Kavanaugh, and leaked in September, but fencing has denied the fact that the inscription took place in his office.
I haven’t been hiding from Dr. Ford’s interpretation; I don’t write his story,” said Finstein, “to the Commission, he’s let’s talk about The Hill newspaper.
‘I asked me to keep secret and I kept it secret, just as I asked him.’
But he didn’t refuse to be welcome on the side of the president, and he said, ‘What will I say to you.’
Perhaps it was not that, but they were the most inappropriate signs I have ever seen.”
Following the Defensor del Pueblo’s defence of the candidate for the Supreme Court, which accused three women of impunity, the president stated that Democrats are using them for their purposes.
They are willing to do anything to recover their power.
They are evil, no matter who they do, who they have to oppress, and to get control,” said the president,mediately reported.

An Indian air controller has become a hero who has been travelling hundreds of passengers after making sure that a plane would be properly aired and killed.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared from a great earthquake on Friday after sawei Island and a tsunami.
There have been many powerful replicas in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the town of Palau.
Although his colleagues opted to save their life, Anthony Gunan Agung refused to leave his place in the 21-year-old place and opted for the control tower at Mutia Sis Al Juffri Airport Paul Airport.
On the other hand, it remained there to ensure that the flight 621 of the United States was correctly air-fired, which was at that point on the track.
He then jumped from the control tower when he saw it collapse.
He died later in hospital.
The decision was made by Yohannes Sirai, who spoke about how to air navigation in Indonesia, saved hundreds of people, as the Australian ABC News area.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalitan, to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he has gone this morning before the helicopter reaches Palura.
“our hearts break down when they hear that,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the death rate will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesia Bureau says that access to the towns of Dongga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The rate is still considered to grow, since many bodies are still under waste and we have not reached many others,” said the Panel spokesperson, Sutopo Purwo Ngroho.
The maximum of six meters have been completely destroyed by the waves, where a massive burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother explained to the Sky News area: “Minturo, an ambulance full of body.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all food from small markets”.
Jan Gelfand, Head of the International Red Cross, commented on the CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is working as soon as possible to help those who have survived, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
The tragedy is already this, but it could be much worse.”
Paul arrived on the Sunday of the President of Indonesia and explained to the country’s military: “You can now complete all the tasks related to the evacuation and ask everyone to work day.
Are you ready?” she reported CNN chains.
Another earthquake has also been shaken in Indonesia this year, which took place in Lombard, and died more than 550 people.
Microelectronic aircraft accident: Air Engineers says that a man is missing in a lake after an aircraft accident
The airline operating the flight that had fallen into a place in the Pacific Ocean says that a man is missing now, after saying that 47 passengers and crew had successfully evacuated the airplane.
Air Engineers said it was not until the evening that a male passenger could not be sure.
The airline said that it is working together with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find a man.
The airline did not immediately request further details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Local boats allowed other passengers and crew to rescue Chuuk landing at the island airport after the plane fell into the water.
The officers said on Friday, seven people were taken to hospital.
As the air was said, there were still six passengers in the hospital, and all in a stable state.
The accident what caused it and the exact order of events is not clear yet.
The aircraft and the U.S. Army said that the aircraft fell at the next leg of the track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane passed through the track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
This is a great thing,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers easily arrived in the waters leading to the emergency exits of the aircraft.
She said she was afraid of the fingers and the riot was being exacerbated and suffered a small wound in her head.
The U.S. Navy said that aiding fishing in port improvement operations was also very helpful in rescue operations, so an inflatable ship was used to transport passengers to the land before the plane was reached within 30 metres (100 feet).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the last two decades in airport accidents registered in PNG, but none was due to Air Engineers.
An analyst completes the chronicle of the night a woman alive
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday during the new trial of a man who, in 2014, was reluctant to have a woman from Mississippi.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the Department of Justice of the United States, was audited for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
According to the jury, he made use of the records of his mobile phone to link the movements that had been done on the night by his 29-year-old Tillis and Jessica Chambers (19 years old) as a result of the attack.
Rowlet said that women were killed in the evening with Tellis Chambers, in order to confirm the previous confirmation of Tellis, according to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis's mobile phone had been with Chambers when Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford.
Sanford appeared on Saturday in front of the judge, and that day was not the case of the people.
When Tellis asked about the truth that he was in the Sanford lorry that night, he said that he was "in lie", "because the truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies: Tellis said he knew that two weeks after his death, Chambers died.
However, according to mobile phone records, they only knew each week.
After the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the text messages, calls, and contact information from the phone of Chambers.
That said, "He wiped out life," he said.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the last additions.
Judges have said that the judgment will come on that day.
The High Breeze: What Is A conscious hip-hop?
A trio of hip-hop musicians want to challenge people with a negative opinion on the type of music, filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed from Bristol says that hip-hop music has abandoned its political messages and the struggle for social problems.
They want to return to their roots and get to know their conscious hip-hop again.
Several artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen the revival of such a hip-hop in the UK, with artists such as Ala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
A New York baby has denounced a couple after a “a racist” message for her release
A New York nurse reported that a couple had been dissecting and reluctant to dismiss him and stating that he was "other black" after receiving a message from his mother.
The couple refused it because it is racist, indicating that the report is “excessive”.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised when she discovered that she was black and black on her first business day in 2016.
She wrote, “EEEEEE, ONE other,” in a text message to her husband, Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman.
But instead, instead of sending to her husband, she sent to Mauice and twice
According to the New York Post newspaper, she realized that she felt uncomfortable, and released her earlier child, which wasn’t a good worker and instead expected a philinic nurse.
Maurice was paid for a single working day and ordered a Uber to take it home.
Now, Maurice has denounced the couple and asked for compensation for the damage caused by the release of $350 for six months, although he was not up to six months at home and hired for that purpose.
I want to show that things like that are not done,” he explained the Post newspaper on Friday, and added: “I know that it is discrimination”.
The couple refused it because they were a racist, and said it was reasonable and necessary to let him down because they feared that they could not be offended with it.
"My wife didn't mean that she sent him something.
It is not racist.
We are not racist,” said Joel Plasco.
But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have offended, even as a result of a mistake?
Your newborn?
Do not even think about it.”
In explaining that the report was not “for this reason,” Pascal said that his wife had been barely two months old and that he was "in a difficult situation".
Are you going to look for someone?
That’s not a good position,” added the investment bank.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the public opinion court has denounced it quickly on social media, penalizing its position and logic.
If the publisher of Paddington did not like a bear that speaks to the readers, a new letter has shown them
She was born shortly after Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who accepted the book, said about her letter: “It is difficult to place someone reading it before publication.
It’s fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington now.”
His father was a cameraman from the BBC chain before he was inspired by a children’s book; his daughter said that his work was a lasting impression on him, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book was a “society,” he died last year.
As for Paddington, he said that he was a “most important member of the family” and that his father was very proud.
He was a silent man and was not puffed up with pride,” he said.
But Paddington was so real for him, because he almost feels like a child: you feel proud of him, even if you do not have your achievement.
In my opinion, so he saw the success of Paddington.
Even though he was the creation of his imagination, he always confessed himself to Paddington.
The daughter was dying and I had to lie on the phone
As soon as they landed, they quickly took their daughter to the Hospital Louis Pasteur hospital in Nice, but the doctors could not do anything to save her life.
Nad was a very serious person to say that he didn’t think he would come out,” said Mrs. Edanna-Lérouse.
Then I received a call from Nad, that he would die in the next two minutes and say that I was to be greeted with him.
And I did that.
I said, “Tash, I love you, my darling.”
I'll be soon with you.
I will be with you.
Doctors gave him the heart to stop causing him and his system was gradually leaving.
He died a little earlier than expected and was finished.
I could just sit and wait, knowing everything would start there.
I could not weep, I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold it back.”
In the end, Mrs. Endan-Lérouse, who had been discredited for the death of his daughter, climbed to the plane with the rest of the passenger, forgetting his grief.
He said, “No one knew,” he said.
I was leaning on my head and the tears fell all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but on the flight I was compassioned by Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him.”
Some unsaven women have put their posters on a bridge to prevent people from making suicide
Two women who lost their lives because of suicide want to prevent their lives from getting lost.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put their posters on a Wales bridge, which has both positive and phone numbers so that people can call them for help.
The son of Mrs. Davis, who was 13 years old when he began to have depression, and he was killed in the age of 18.
I don’t want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, saying that he had a special gift for cooking, and had an inspiring smile.
They all knew about it because of smile.
They always said that his smile cleared any place.”
However, before his death he left his job, because he was in a “very dark place”.
In 2014 he found his brother 11 years old in Tyler, who had taken away his life.
The Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about if there’s a domino effect.”
The Mrs. Davis created a series of posters, “because people know what happens to you and people can help you, even if they were a friend.
Do not stay silent; you have to talk to him.”
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and he also spent 15 years missing his mother Mark.
He did not say that he was sad, not even depressed,” he said.
Just a few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed attitude.
He was buried on Christmas Day; when the children opened the presents, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to go ahead: “He leaves a gap in the family.
It leaves us on earth.
But we all have to continue ahead and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanagh is in danger of research at the FBI
I thought, if he could get something like he asked, such as a limited time or limited district research, perhaps we could have achieved a bit of unity,” said Mr Clarke Saturday, and he added that he was afraid to “divided” against the obstacles caused by the passionate parties.
Why did the FBI not want him to investigate the case of Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican followers?
The opposite feedback is for time.
Only five weeks will be for the middle of the mandates: on November 6, the Republic is expected to get poor results, and if so, they will begin a race to get the chosen man for the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has made several phone calls to Senators, and has set pressure to support the Mr. Kavanaugh, as he worked for Mr. Kavanagh in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens to the FBI after his report?
The vote will be made in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 democratics are seated.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanagh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, the Vice President Mike Penence could break the draw and submit it to the Supreme Court.
The number of breakaways in Northern Korea has done ‘low’ since Kim’s power
The number of people fleeing North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took over seven years, according to a South Korean legislative.
Park Byeong-segu, referring to the data of the South Korean Assembly’s Department, said 1,127 had been refugees over the previous year, in 2011.
Mr Park said that strengthening the border controls between North Korea and China has had a great impact on personal traffic regulations.
Pyongyang has not made public comments.
Almost everyone in North Korea is offered to the South Korean Writers' Association sooner or later.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 Norths have crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escaped through China, the longest frontier in North Korea, and it is easier to cross more than the demilitary zone between two of the Coreas (DMZ).
China adopts refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often forced them.
In North Korea and South Korea still exist, the relationships between the two have improved significantly in the last months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations of depopulation.
Previously, a historical meeting between the US President Donald Trump and the Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to a non-nuclear peninsula.
But on Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ri Yongo accused the U.S. fines that had not been carried out since that time.
If we do not have any confidence with the US, we will have no confidence in our national security, so we will not leave weapons first,” said Mr. Ri in a UN General Assembly conference held in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has said “histo” to Brett Kavanagh, and that he is not ready to be in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the Chamber of Commerce, says that she is “historic” to the candidate for the Supreme Court, and that she is not prepared for the genius to remain in the Supreme Court.
His comments on an interview with Pelosi on Saturday took place at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn’t stop thinking if a woman ever had played such as a “historic”” he said that on Thursday Vanaugh had the reaction to the Senate Standing Committee.
Kavanagh denied Dr. Christine Bassay Ford's sexual attack when both were teenagers.
In the initial speech, Kavanagh was very sensitive, and sometimes he started shouting and talking about his family and youth.
He also explicitly reported that the Democratic Committee, which voted against the President, Hillary Clinton, said that the election of the president for 2016 was “commpersonated and offensive” organized by the liberals who are angry with losing.
He said that the testimony of Kavanagh is clear that there cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has an impartial opinion against Democrats.
With these assertions and his attitude against the Clinton and Democrats, he stayed out of the league,” he said.
He objected the choice of Kavanaugh and the democrats questioned whether they were getting the majority in the House of Representatives.
I will say, “If it is not true to Congress or the FBI, then it is not ready to be in the Supreme Court, not to be in the court that is currently at this time”, he said.
Currently, he is the judge of the Court of Appeals on the Kavanaugh D.C. circuit.
He added, as a democracy, is concerned with the decisions that Kavanagh will oppose the applicable health care law or the RO v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the confirmation court, Kavanagh avoided questions when asked about certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
A historical and impartial person cannot go to the court and we expect it well,” he said.
And women have to prescribe it.
It is a fair talk, a huge rage for months and years, and it can’t release without crying.
We cry when we get angry,” the woman Steinme said to me 45 years later.
I don't think it's strange, isn't it?"
He continued to say, “As a woman in somebody’s executive, he was greatly helped me and told me that she was also crying out, but when she developed a technique, she told her when she was angry and started crying, “As I am weeping, you can think I am sad.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
The tears are not badly seen because they are sometimes interpreted incorrectly.
I remembered something of one of my first works, most of which was in a male office, where I was crying out again, and a larger older woman arrived from the neck and since then I was a little worried about it.
Let me never see you cry,” he told me.
They don’t know if you’re in love.
They think you’re sad, and they’ll feel well because you’re here.”
Patricia Schroeder, a democratic partner at the time, worked with Gary Hart for his presidency.
In 1987, Dr. Mr. Monkey Business was captured in a container and his wife, who had a love affair with another woman, decided to become the same candidate for the President of the Race.
It wasn’t the decision well done,” he said about 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one was another.
Someone called "You and the seven wings".
As the campaign began to collect the money left, he decided that he would not enter the race until $2 million was collected.
The battle was lost.
He knew that some followers who gave up $1,000 to men gave them only $ 250.
Do they think I have a discount?” asked him.
When he gave a talk and reported that he would not have made an official campaign, he was very excited about the good thanks to the people, the money and the number of voters to the system, and the anger towards the sexist.
When you were very nervous," explained the woman Schroeder about the reaction that the press had seen in his position.
You would think Kleenx was my sponsor.
I remember what I thought: What will be written in my cemetery?
He cried out?
The benefits of trading war between the US and China
The start of the commercial war between the US and China were brutal, and although the conflict is alive, it is likely that the gap between the countries would benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
Donald Trump threw the US president at the beginning of the year; then he set up a tax to the main products he exported by China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important climb has arrived this week, with the use of new tariffs that affect products with a value of $200 billion (150 billion free) from China to half of the goods transported to the USA.
Beijing has applied its repressive daily, and the final price has been increased by up to five to ten percent to US goods worth 60 billion euros.
China has said it will match each rise in the US, and the second most powerful economy in the world will not easily change its blink.
Asking for a withdrawal to Washington would mean going, but publicly surrendering to the U.S. would be more embarrassing the President of China, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing is doing well, pressures from the American commercial war can benefit China for a long period of time, as they will reduce the dependency on both economies.
The decision makers of Washington or Beijing would quickly create requirements for economic mining in one of the two countries, which is more dangerous than what the observers thought," said the researcher Abigail Grace, along with other experts who researched Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria is willing to get refugees back as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said
Syria says that it is willing to return to refugees who want to return, and that support is to build a country that has endured long wars for more than seven years.
In response to the United Nations General Assembly, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it is improving the country's situation.
It is now a more stable and safer situation thanks to the advances made in the anti-terrorist process,” he said.
The government continues to renovate the destroyed areas so that they can get back as quickly as possible.
Now the situation is the right way for refugees who voluntarily sought to return to the country due to economic measures that hindered terrorism and their daily life and maintenance.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime will greatly appreciate the support of the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the conditional support was not supported by the countries.
Europe wins the edition of the Ryder Cup held in Paris
After defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 points on the last score, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, which was held in Paris outside France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row, and has not won the cup of Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe brought the crown again when it reached 14.5 points that the team of Captain Thomas Bjorn needed to defeat the United States.

The European competition, which took part in the eight Ryder Cup, became the main winner of the European competition, with a score of 2.5 races.
I usually do not weep, but today I can not avoid it.
It has been a tough year.
So thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy, even recovering the cup.
This is a team work and I’m happy I’ve been able to help,” said García, excited, after the victory of Europe.
John Ram passed to the Spanish, who defeated the American myth, Tiger Woods, and 1) on Sunday individual game.
I am very proud of being defeated by Tiger Woods; I saw that man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost four games in France and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 results in the Ryder Cup.
A curious statistic for one of the best players that has ever been, which has won 14 major titles, just above Jack Nicklaus.
The American team spent the whole weekend looking for solutions to the situation, except players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a top quality golf all over the tournament.
Jim Fury, captain of the United States, said: “I am proud of my guys, they have tried.
This morning we pressureed Europe for a moment.
It is not well taken out.
Bejodendio Thomas.
It is a great captain.
Its 12 players have played very well.
We will meet again, I will collaborate with the USA PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love my 12 boys and I am very proud of being their captain.
We need to accept the defeat.
We’ve been away.”
