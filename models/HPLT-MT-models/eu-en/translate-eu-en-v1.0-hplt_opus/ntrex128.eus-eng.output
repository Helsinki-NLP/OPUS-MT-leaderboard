The members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed their concerns that they would "consider it as puppets".
Some members of the assembly have expressed their distress after hearing a suggestion to change the name of their position as MWP (the Welsh Parliamentary Member).
This idea arose after the development of plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly.
The members of the political council are concerned that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour Party at the meeting has said that “the new name rhymes with the words Twp and Pwp”.
If you’re out of Wales: in Wales, twp means “idiocy” and pwp means “shit”.
On the other hand, one of the members of the Scottish council said that the whole team is "not very happy" and suggested that they look for alternative names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales also said that the name “is open” to new ideas, but he also expressed his concerns for the rhymes that might involve MWP changes.
In order to better understand this conflict, it is necessary to note that the letters w in Wales and the English letters u in Yorkshire have similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the committee’s commission, which is creating a legal draft for name changes, said: “In relation to the members of the assembly, they will have the sole responsibility of choosing the descriptive persons who wish to use them.”
According to the Welsh government's act of 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation for the selection of proposals suggested, and the Welsh Parliament generally received many solidarity statements.
With regard to the names of members of the assembly, the Commission chose the Welsh Parliamentary Member or WMP (in English), but the name MWP was chosen as the most selective in a public consultation.
On the other hand, members of the Assembly suggest alternative options, but it can be extremely difficult to choose an option unanimously; especially for the assembly president, Elin Jones, who has to send a draft in a few weeks with the changes.
However, the Legislature of the changes to be made will affect the functioning of the meeting, among other things, rules will be created to prevent good name loss to members of the Assembly and the design of the assembly system will be managed with the help of this law.
When discussing the change in the legislature, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make a final decision on their names.
The Macedonians participate in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide to change the country’s name to “North Macedonia” or “North Macedonia’s Republic”.
This vote has been organized in order to be able to solve a long story of the last few decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The Athens government has long stressed that the name of the northern neighbour is a repatriation of its territory and has repeatedly prevented its entry into the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia’s president, Gjorge Ivanov, said that he will ignore the vote if he is opposed to the plebiscite to change his name.
However, the followers of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) claim that it is only a price to be paid to enter the EU and NATO.
The bells of the church of San Martin lose their voice because of the problems of the churches in Harlem
I’ve talked to a lot of elderly people and they say you could find a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Today, there is nothing.”
He says that the disappearance of the bar is normal.
People use other methods to socialize,” he explains.
Bars are no longer the neighborhoods where people used to live.
As for the churches, it is concerned that the money acquired for the sale of assets will not be sufficient and “we will be back at the beginning sooner or later”.
In addition, churches can be replaced with homes and properties will be built with people who do not care about the surrounding temples.
People who will buy properties will be white people,” he says, “and therefore the churches will close quickly because these new people are not members of the congregation of the churches.
The two churches were built by the congregations of white people before a black Harlem metropolis; it was the metropolitan community of 1870 and was built in San Martin a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, he was taken by a black community.
The black congregation of Reverend John Howard Johnson hosted the church of San Martin; Howard organized a boycott against 125 commercial street shops in Harlem that did not hire or raise black people.
A fire in 1939 caused a number of damage, but Father Johnson's parishes designed several plans to build the church again and commissioned a collection of carillons.
Reverend David Johnson, son of his father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, named the carillon "the bells of the poor people".
In July, the expert who played the carillon gave it another name: “The treasure of culture” and “the irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also stated that he has been the first black musician to play a larger locksmith at the Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather explains that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In the last few months, San Martín has witnessed the painful displacements of different architects and contractors, some brought by secular leaders or by episcopal diocese.
On the other hand, in July the Parish Council (consistence of secular leaders) sent a letter to the diocese to verify that the hiring of these people will “the costs produced will pass to the parish”, because the parish has nothing to do with the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the project.
Some Ecclesiastes have submitted their complaints for the lack of transparency of the diocese.
A shark wound a 13-year-old child while looking for oysters on the California Coast
According to police, on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy, who was looking for oysters on the coast of California, the first day of the oyster-era.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the San Diego KSWB-TV channel that he was swimming with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning, but he heard his friend screaming for help; then he swam to his friend with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel first thought he was screaming with joy because he had found an oyster, but then he realized that his friend was "biting me!"
I've been bitten!
I could see his whole cell,” Hammel said, after seeing his friend.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark!" Hammel explained.
Rady of San Diego children was taken to the hospital and his situation is serious.
Could not detect the species of shark that attacked.
Captain Larry Giles of the Soros Corps has filed a report in front of the media and said they saw a shark a few weeks before, but it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles also noted that the victim's wounds are at the top of the dress.
The police have closed the entrances to the Swami beach in Encinitas on the Casablanca beach to conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure the safety of the people.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Saintsbury’s supermarket plans come into the UK’s cosmetic market
Saintsbury’s supermarket has intervened in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers beauty departments in the style of large shops with a wide range of expert and specialized staff.
While sales of fashion and household products are decreasing, 2.8 billion euros have been invested in the UK beauty sector, which is growing unrestricted, with higher levels of beauty being built and tested in 11 stores in the country.
Investments in the area of beauty allow supermarkets to take advantage of televisions, microwaves and domestic products.
According to Saintsbury’s supermarkets, the offer of their beauty products will be doubled and will offer more than 3000 products, as well as brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Paw Paw Paww will be available to customers.
With regard to the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, they will have more space in marked areas, such as the Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket presents its “Boutique” brand makeup, which is a fully vegan product, with younger buyers demanding more and more products like this.
In addition, the steam merchant Fragance Shop will test offers offered at the two Sainsbury’s supermarket stores; the first one opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of the year.
Because online shopping and food shopping in small local stores are trends, supermarkets need to work head and ear to attract customers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Saintbury’s supermarket, said that sales points will take on the style of large stores and that the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of both Times and Lidl competitors by offering more products and non-food products.
The Saintsbury's supermarket has opened the Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats after purchasing two chains two years ago, which has led to a solid sell of food and a value of its acquired chains more than ever.
The supermarket tried to reopen the beauty and medicine department, but the strategy failed.
Later, he joined Saintsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but this association ended because the process of dividing profits obtained in the supermarket's medical departments became a burn paper.
A new strategy was organised when the supermarket, Saintsbury’s, sold pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals from its 281 stores to Celesius, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will have one function in the plan: it will add a large range of luxury cover brands to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Saintsbury's supermarket, said: "We have improved the appearance of beauty departments so that our customers can find the perfect environments.
We also hire highly-experienced staff to provide detailed advice regarding products.
We have designed our range of brands to meet all the requirements and, thanks to convenient environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and simple choice in front of the shops that use obsolete methods.
Peter Jones is “exasperated” after Holly Willoughby cancels his offer of £11 million
Dragons was the star of the Den because it wanted to pay full attention to the new contracts with Marks Spencer and ITV, after the television host Holly Willoughby cancelled the offer of £11 million related to the permanent brand business.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the brand that sells home products and components.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning program's presenters, 37, were used in Instagram to present their resignation.
Following Holly Willoughby's resignation to approve contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, the star in Dragons' Deen was greatly upset by the fact that Peter Jones was leaving a lucrative business between them at the last moment.
According to our sources, on Tuesday there was a conflicting meeting in the main sede in Marlowe and, as a result, Jones was "very angry" when she heard the explanation of our most famous television woman: she would accept 1.5 million new contracts and, therefore, would no longer be able to spend more time on home products and components of the brand.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Patrow's Goop brand and doubled Willoughby's 11 million-franc piece.
Willoughby, 37, after stating on Instagram that he was leaving the brand business, Jones left the UK to go to a holiday home.
One source said: “There has always been a possibility among Holly’s priorities.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us with a mouthful.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, when the brand's offer closed.
Moreover, the warehouse of the Marlowe residence is full of products to be sold."
According to experts, the company is about to lose millions of pounds for the presentation of The Morning (which is the most profitable presenter in the UK), the company has invested a lot of money in a variety of products (including cushions, candles, clothes, and household products) and is facing the now possible delays.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children, and Tara Capp have been close friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe created the Truly brand in 2016 and joined Jones as its director in March.
Both couples always plan their holidays together and have 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be ambassador to M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme of the ITV channel.
A source from Jones' group stated last night that he would not say anything about his business.
It’s hard to say, “We fell in love.”
He was joking about what was wrong with the media, making everything “unsuitable” comment about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so many things?
Trump has used his “TV presenter” voice to respond to jokes:
I didn't give anything.
After the first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said that he wants to organise a second meeting, which has allowed him to take a step on the way to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament process has stopped.
After a three-month meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to UN leaders: In the general meeting held on Saturday, North Korea has not seen a “appropriate response” in terms of the country’s steps towards nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have escalated to maintain the country's pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic view and has said so in his last speech.
Our relationship with North Korea is better than ever.
We were also at war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed in this war.
But now we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
He also said that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in good results; among other things, the missile tests have ended, the kidnappers have been improved, and the rest of the U.S. military has launched.
He also explains his unusual approach to interviews with Kim.
It’s an easy task for the president, but instead of having 10,000 forcibly entered the country, we have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the personals he collected there.
Indonesia tsunamis and earthquakes destroy an island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, aid from non-profit organizations was not necessary.
10 percent of the population of Lombok were displaced, but the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (a precondition for the request of national aid).
In many cases, unfortunately, the government said clearly that it did not need international assistance, so this situation is a challenge,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is being formed by a team that will move to Palau, but still does not know whether volunteers can work in the country.
Mr Sutopo, representing the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are working in Palma to support international agencies.
Despite a number of earthquakes, Indonesia has implemented a number of key measures to address natural rage.
Forts against tsunami have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Paul doesn't have a siren to warn people, and even if he's warning him, maybe that's why he's so dead.
When there is good weather, travelling between Indonesia's islands can be a challenge.
Moreover, natural disasters make it difficult to implement logistics.
A hospital ship was anchored in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake and is now heading to Palma, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the disaster.
The campaign of the President of the Game Widedo focused on projects to improve Indonesia’s infrastructure and has invested a lot of money in improving roads and railways.
However, the funds have been reduced and the administration of the President of the Game is in administration while preparing the next year’s elections.
The game also has problems controlling the conflicts of the Indonesian sects, for example, most of the Islamic parties have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have died, and tens of thousands have lost their homes because their struggles have been taken to the streets by Christian and Islamic bands, including machetes, arches, arrows, and similar weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge's draw-goal vs. Chelsea
The match against Chelsea was considered a loss to the Premier League that led Liverpool to survive thanks to the goal scored by Daniel Sturridge on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge in the 89th minute.
Thanks to the pacing of Xherdan Shaqi from 30 yards to Chealsee, Sturridge had the opportunity to change the 1-0 scoreboard.
Before he kicked the ball into the door's pole, he put it on his left.
Thanks to this kick, the ball flew to the area and moved to the top right of the net.
Finally, the ball passed the support of Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the network.
Because players like Shaq always play at the top, I wanted to get that position so I could get the ball; that’s why I tried to get enough time,” Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that the song was coming, and with one touch, the ball was at my feet; after that I didn't have too much time to think: I just took the chance."
Belgian stars Eden Hazard, after scoring a goal in the 25th minute, was winning 1-0 in the middle of the game in Chelsea.
In this play, the forward of the blue team returned to Mateo Kovacci, who turned round in the middle of the field and ran in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacci worked on a prank in the middle of the field.
Then he gave the ball a great blow, and he was in the arena to the foot of Hazard.
Hazard overcame the other team's defense and pushed the ball into the gate pole network with a left-foot strike that destroyed Alison Becker's defense at Liverpool.
Liverpool's next fight will be with Napoleons at the Champions League team stage at 15:00 in the afternoon, Wednesday, at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea will face the Videoton Club at the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday, 15:00, in London.
The number of Indonesian deaths increases to 832 due to tsunami
According to the disaster agency on Sunday, Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami increased the number of casualties to 832.
According to the press conference, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, after suffering 7.5 levels of earthquakes and 20 high feet of waves, has caught a number of people between the rubble of buildings.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with rubble.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing a woman and killing her.
A murder investigation has begun following the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found with stab wounds at the John Grayson Mews in the morning 7.55, when a 32-year-old man was arrested as the main suspect of the murder.
Police have asked people in the neighborhood if they have seen or heard anything, to call the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "It's just the beginning of the investigation, but if anyone saw or heard anything on Calle John de Birkenhead, we'd like to get in touch with him.
We also want to ask for help from drivers in cars that can make recordings, including taxi drivers, because it is possible that the necessary information for research is recorded."
On the other hand, a police officer confirmed that the woman found lived in Birkenhead and found her body inside a house.
That afternoon, several of the people who know her arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning.
As the investigation progresses, the police will contact the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has been trying to enter his apartment, but the police have told him that no one can enter the building or leave it.
When he heard the news, he was amazed.
Neighbors will have to wait a few hours for them to enter their homes.
A police officer was talking to a neighbor and was stating that the whole area would be taken as a place of murder.
Later, a woman came crying where she was.
Again and again he said, “It’s scary.”
At 14:00, the two police patrol cars entered the police line and another patrol was left out.
Several police officers have checked the building's apartments.
Anyone with information can send an email to DM @MerPolCC account, call 101 or call Crimestopers' phone number (0800 55 111); simply refer to September 30th 247.
The State of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the final target of the trend to "rewrite history"
If it disappears, there will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed various religious objects, the Puritans of England did the same with various historical and cultural objects in the country.
Mr. Crick's suggestion, however, is that he "is trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, representing Cromwell, said: "It is an unavoidable debate about the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside the Westminster Palace; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself has never asked or organized the iconoclastic wars of England.
Maybe we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the deeds that Thomas had done in the last century.
The stunning depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the views of the 19th century and our historiography; many people still believe that the actions of this person should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said in The Sunday Telegraph: “In the 19th century, fewer people believe this, but many still believe that Cromwell was a parliamentary defender against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are referring to monarchy.
It will continue to be the essence of historical debate whether this person's representation is accurate or not.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has been the starting point of the evolution of our country, and the famous Cromwellian was part of the parties involved in this starting point.
The title “Lord Protector” could also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he won.”
A pig is killed by a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a peasant in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man with the surname "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a cut-off artery and he was bleeding in a Lipanshu market ranch in Guizhou Province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the pig rancher is prepared to insert pigs into China’s Qinghai province in Xining.
Usually, on Wednesdays she travels from Yunnan province with her cousin for the sale of 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the dead and saw that the door of the neighbor's pig farm was open.
He also stated that there was a large pig with blood in its mouth.
The court's analysis report confirms that it was a 550-pound pig that killed a farmer.
My cousin’s legs were full of blood and crushed” said in the Guiyang Evening News, whose last name is “Wu”.
According to the recordings of the security camera, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Thursday) for the grazing of pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan's or his cousin's stroke.
According to a market master, Evening News, the pig is locked to prevent further attacks and allow police to gather evidence of place.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Even though it is rare, several pig attacks have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 £ pig encircled a Welsh farmer in his tractor, until the man's wife repelled the animal.
In 2012, a farmer’s pigs from Oregon ate his body, and after that, a peasant from Manitoba reported that pigs are not aggressive animals, but that if they taste blood, that can act as “agents”.
They love to play.
They're like children and they're very curious and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's small storms leave rains in the southwestern United States
According to the weather, Hurricane Rosa is weakening while moving to cold water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rose will bring rain showers to the north of Mexico and to the south west of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa produces 85 miles per hour of wind and will turn into a 1st category hurricane. According to Eastern time, on Sunday, it was discovered 385 miles from the Southwestern Eugenia of Mexico.
On Sunday, we are expecting Rosa to go to the north.
Meanwhile, a lower-pressure point is forming in the Pacific and will travel east to the west coasts of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja will move to California's mainland as a tropical storm and lead tropical humidity to the north to the south-west of the United States.
Also, on Monday, Rose will bring 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
The tropical humidity will then be combined with the low pressure point and heavy rains will rise in the southwest days.
In local places, 1-4 inches of water can be dangerous because sudden flooding, debris debris, and landfall can occur in the desert.
Rainfalls produced by large tropical humidity can leave 2-3 inches of water at specific times and locations, particularly in the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 inches of water in the southwest, particularly in Arizona.
Because tropical rains are slippery, they can cause sudden flooding and deterioration conditions.
It is not recommended to take a stroll to the desert if a tropical storm has been reported.
The rain showers can make the canyons violent streams, and the storms can bring gust winds and dust.
In addition, as the pressure falls, there will be local rain showers on the southern coasts of California.
It is possible to collect water half an inch due to rain and to generate small currents and sliding roads.
This could be the first rainy season in the region.
There may also be scattered tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday and Monday, but there will be more rain on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rain showers will travel to the four corners and last until Wednesday.
October may undergo severe temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic territory cools, but the warm temperatures of the tropics remain.
Sometimes these temperatures change significantly over short distances.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes on Sunday in the middle of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees difference between the cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and the cities of St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the warmth of summer will arrive and spread everywhere.
The middle and east of the United States will have warm October; temperatures of 80 degrees will range from the south to the northeast.
They can also be up to 80 degrees on Tuesday in New York; they are about 10 degrees above the average temperature.
Depending on the long-term weather forecast, the east side of the United States will suffer higher temperatures than average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh’s statement.
More than 20 million people saw in the sixth channel news of Tuesday the extraordinary declarations of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford of the Supreme Court who accused Kavanaugh of sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued and the channel's presenters suspended the usual Friday schedule to announce a last minute news: Senator Jeff Flake agreed with the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation.
According to Ford's statement to the Senate magistrate's assembly, he is convinced that Kavanaugh had touched him repeatedly while he was drunk and had tried to take his clothes off at a high school party.
For Kavanaugh, in a statement of enthusiasm, he said that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen, approximately 20.4 million people were wiped out on Friday.
The company calculated an average viewer on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen has problems counting people who watch television in the offices.
For an example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or the Academy Awards.
With regard to Fox News Channel, the presenters of Kavanaugh’s statement are fully accepting and, on average, had a $5.69 million watch while he was making a statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After listening to the statement, people remained interested.
It was the heart of Flake's Friday drama.
Following the announcement that the Republican side's office would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras of CNN and CBS channels recorded Kavanaugh on Friday as he was attempting to take an elevator surrounded by protesters to declare it at the Magistrate Assembly.
CNN found directly on the channel that his gaze had fallen while protesters clashed.
I’m here in front of you,” said a woman.
Do you really think he’s telling the truth?
And he added, "You have incredible power, but there are many women who have nothing."
At that moment and before closing the elevator doors, Flake said his office had published a notification and would give more details to the meeting's view.
Cable and television stations were sending direct visits every hour, while the board was voting for the appointment of Kavanaugh as Senator.
However, Flake said he would vote if the FBI had examined the candidate for a week; remember that he was asking the Democratic minority party to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons, Flake was almost convinced of the investigation.
After speaking to Coons and several Senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, because the Republican party did not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without doing research.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British prime minister May accuses critics of “playing with politics” on the basis of Brexit
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May is accusing people who criticize her plans to leave the European Union to play with the future of the UK and undermine the interests of the country.
On 29 September 2018, Britain, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party speech to be held in Birmingham.
In another interview on the first page of the newspaper, the former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticized a plan that was called "adamage game" for Brexit and that the British and European Union paid taxes "was absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyson Simpson for the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspicious person for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old college basketball player for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and entered prison for a second-degree crime, said Baton Rouge police department.
The police shared a video of the discussion between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses to the fight.
According to CBS's WWF partner, the police recovered those glasses from the scene and said Simpson's DNA was there.
After asking Simpson, he confessed to having shot Wayde.
His lawyer said his bail was set at 350,000 USD.
East Baton Rouge Court Office published a preliminary report on Friday, in which the cause of death is said to be a shot from the head to the neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police Department for the discovery of refugees, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the neighbouring Citizens for their support in investigating the suspect.
LSU’s sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the police for his ‘principle and for his support of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter player Baton grew up in Rouge and his father also played in basketball for Wayne, LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in the last season games.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the band was "fallen" and "struck" by Wayden's death.
These are the things that always bother you," Wade said.
A volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The pre-war national center warned the Mexicans on Saturday and recommended distance from the volcano after detecting several activities in the crater; 183 gas and ash emissions were registered 24 hours.
Half of the volcano also had a lot of tremors.
Depending on the social media images, thin layers of ash can be seen in the windshields of cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City (e.g. Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have found that the activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, has increased since a magnitude of 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fighting between police and Catalan independenceists for independence before the anniversary of independence
Six people were arrested this Saturday in Barcelona to remember the first anniversary of the Catalan elections for independence as thousands of people joined parties in the fight against the police.
The riot police halted a group of independents disguised as riots, but they threw eggs and paint powder, resulting in the creation of dust clouds in the streets filled with tourists.
More fights arose later because the police were using their own bats to stop the fighting.
In addition, groups of independence had spent several hours singing “We will not forgive” in front of unionists who were singing “long life to Spain”.
According to local journalists, fourteen people were treated for small wounds received during disputes.
There is a lot of nervousness in this region that wants to find independence after the election on 1 October, which were illegal by the government of Madrid, but Catalan separatists got a day to celebrate it.
Most voters voted for independence, but the citizen participation was very low because of the number of citizens who wanted to boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1000 were wounded after the police attack, as ballot boxes went to the polling stations to stop voters, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups camped on Friday to avoid a National Police demonstration.
It was a demonstration, but they forced him to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and attended the independence demonstration with his wife, who said that Catalonia no longer has the hope of attaining independence.
We had a wonderful time last year.
My parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we're stuck.
After a brilliant but important victory in recent December local elections, Catalan independence parties have had many problems to maintain the public interest this year; some of the parties have either been overseas or have been detained and are now awaiting a trial for the organization of the referendum and the declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording a demonstration on his phone and says both parties are guilty of this situation.
There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections for the year in which he has been in prison.
If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government.
Londonderry: Three men are arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, have been arrested for repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry with their car.
The event was held at the Ballynagard Crescent at 7:30 P.M. (BST) Tuesday afternoon.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors were damaged.
They also seem to have used a brake in the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 in front of Rangers thanks to the release of the manga
Dolly Menga’s first goal confirms the height of Livingston
Livingston, a high-ranking player in Rangers, wins his second defeat in 18 games as leader of the Ibrox club.
The launch of Dolly Menga was decisive that the team at the Gary Holten Hibernian level rose in the second half.
The War Team is unbeaten in this Premiership season and will have to play against the Hearts (who have eight points more) on Sunday.
Before this match, Rangers will play with Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team has not been defeated and there are six matches left during this season; Coach Holt does not know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston loses a lot of opportunities in front of strong visitors.
The Holt team had to anticipate the goal before entering; with tremendous honesty, it created several problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but all his efforts were lost in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgow turned his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's head.
Hosts were happy to let Rangers play, but they knew their guests could bother them anytime.
And with that in mind came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave a free throw and Livingston set up an opening point; Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined to mark the Menga, but the latter touched the ball and scored a goal in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game, the property was dominated by the Rangers, but the defense of the house was indispensible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without any problems.
This model continued to the center of the second half, but Alfredo Morelos' throw required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman was unable to score goals for Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided a further move in Livingstone.
Passes repeatedly entered Livingston's area and the home players were repeatedly removed; two penalty kicks were requested, due to Halkett defying Glenn Middleton and touching the ball, but both were rejected.
Livingston's "funny" game - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston’s game has been great and the result has been great.
They’ve done great things for me and have great opportunities to get up there.
The style of the games and the team has not changed since they reached the first level, but Holt has been an exceptional coach: the team has been on the right track since their arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett’s work has been tremendous; he has organized and managed a unique defense, and Menga has been in charge of making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell nervous throughout the game.
Rangers weren't very inspirational.
They work very well when they are under war orders, but they have forgotten the standards established by the coach.
The last game was too weak and only once they defeated the defense of the houses; the Rangers have to hurry fast if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds the opposite welcomes in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies (September 29) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
Erdogan is the last day of the German visit; the visit was arranged to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as the lack of human rights and freedom of press and access to Turkey in the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population in Turkey.
The security measures imposed by the police blocked 25,000 people who wanted to gather in front of the mosque, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan (most of them were Kurdish) gathered their voices to protest Erdogan’s policy measures and the German government’s decision to welcome the president.
Protestors on both sides who reflected the disagreements aroused by the president; some say that German Turks are a hero and others say that they are only an autocrat.
Deptford Road accident: A cyclist dies after a car crash
A motorcyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the junction of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m.; this highway in the south-east of the city is usually overflowing by car.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died on the spot.
On Childers Street, a mile from the accident that took place on Saturday, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver fled.
The Metropolitan Police are working to identify the man and inform his family.
Several roads have been closed and the usual route of bus lines has changed, and motor drivers are also advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six wounded officers in a dispute
Six prison officers were injured in a men's high-security conflict, the prison office said.
The HMP Long Latin prison in Worcestershire was founded at 09:30 a.m. (BST) Sunday morning, and the riot has not yet ended.
Official "Tornado" experts have arrived in prison to end the clash initiated by eight arrests, which is now confined to a wing of the building.
Officers had small wounds on their faces and were healed there.
A prison service representative said: “We have sent the prison staff to end the riots in HMP Long Lartin.
We've cured six of our wounded workers.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who have started a fight will be handed to the police and they will probably spend much more time in the prison bars.”
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 arrests and among them is the country's most violent crime.
In June, the mayor of the prison had to go to the hospital for the assault of a prisoner.
In addition, during the last month of October, the anti-combat officers had to go to jail to stop a serious confrontation, as the prisoners were attacking the workers with the billiard clubs.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat to the sudden flooding in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possibly taking advantage of some of the driest areas)
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but this is what will happen next week as Hurricane Rosa runs out of its strength; it will visit the southwest desert and there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued a warning on Monday and Friday about the sudden floods that can be created; the hurricane will enter western Arizona and head south and east of Nevada, and it will also pass through the southeast of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be on Monday will indicate her arrival.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has written in a tweet that “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones created 200 miles from Phoenix have kept the status of tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
According to the latest announcements from the National Hurricane Center, 2-4 inches of water will be collected, with a maximum of 6 inches of water on the edge of Mogollon in Arizona.
Other areas in the south-west of the desert, such as the Rocky Mountains in the centre and the Great Basin, will gather 1-2 inches of water; in isolated areas there will be a maximum of 4 inches.
As for those who expect sudden flooding, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing because of the droughts of the land.
Floods should not be underestimated, but rain showers can be beneficial for droughts that are undergoing the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought control service, 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from severe droughts, which is the second highest category, the weather.com site stated.
First, Hurricane Rosa passes through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa's strength will remain on Sunday morning and produce a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour; Mexico's Punta Eugenia will be 385 miles from the south, with a speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding cold water in the Pacific and as a result its capacity is weakening.
In this way, it will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
Because there may be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high flooding risk.
According to weather.com site, "the rain showers will leave 3-6 inches of water to the south west of Baja California to Sono, and some places may gather 10 inches."
Next, Rosa travels from Mexico to the north as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the mornings of Tuesday as a tropical depression; then crossing Arizona and going south on Tuesday night to Utah.
The greatest threats to Rosa or her storms are the severe storms that will arise in Baja California, Sonora in the northwest and the desert of the south-west of the United States,” said the national Hurricane Center.
These rains will cause sudden floods and hazardous waste runs in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Trying to Kill Someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for murder effort after finding a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Middle Norton Excelsior Terrace area at 04:00 on Saturday morning (BST).
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is “steady”.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
If someone has recorded or traces of what happened to the phone, police have asked for their help.
Trump says that Kavanaugh “must suffer with senseless rage” in the democratic party.
The votes given to Judge Kavanaugh are rejected by the unspeakable and irritating tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh should suffer from the "sensity and rage" of the democratic party in his naming process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress on Tuesday, and completely refuted Christine Blasey Ford's eulogy; according to the woman, Kavanaugh had been raped for decades when she was teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his eulogy.
On Saturday, the president said, “On that day, the citizens of the United States saw Kavanaugh’s courage, intelligence, and quality.”
The votes for the election of Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this jurist has spent his whole life protecting public services," said the President to the followers of West Virginia.
In addition to Kavanaugh's nomination, the president also spoke about the role of the Republican Party in these elections.
There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to campaign," he said.
That’s why I’m here to fight against the perfect candidate.
Trump also said that the Democratic Party is using strategies to “stop and complicate” the campaign.
According to a high-ranking member of the Republican Party, the process of voting for Kavanaugh will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami; the number of deaths increases
On Saturday, authorities said that at least 384 people have been killed as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis caused by Sulawesi Island in Indonesia; most of them have died while the giant waves destroyed the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but the waves of six metres (18 ft) in the evening shattered the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything that was on the way was destroyed.
The tsunami was triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
The tsunami warning was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach for a number of activities and did not immediately escape; that is why they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in an interview with the Indonesian disaster agency (BNPB) representative in Jakarta.
The tsunami drove cars, trunks, and homes and destroyed everything that was in the land,” says Nugroho, “and even more so, the tsunami has traveled through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
Many people have climbed trees to escape from the tsunami and have survived,” said the representative.
Approximately 16,700 people attended 24 centres in Palau.
Various buildings and shops are destroyed, destroyed bridges and a water-covered mosque can be seen in aerial photographs taken by the anti-reportal agency.
The earthquakes continued to blow up the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes have been observed in a territory of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by the Indonesian Agency for the validation and application of Technology (BPPT), Friday the main release of the energy level was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is situated in a narrow bay, may be related to the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
According to Nugroho, the disaster has been “expandive”; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims have been found among the ruins of the destroyed buildings, resulting in 540 more injuries and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said that the number of victims and the disaster can increase along the 300 km coast of Palau (90 miles), a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicentre.
The Donggal media “do not work and we do not have any information,” said Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross data, there are more than 300,000 inhabitants in this area, currently moving to areas affected by the organisation’s workers and volunteers to provide assistance.
It’s a tragedy, but it can be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received rigorous criticism not to provide any information about the tsunami that had destroyed Palu, but according to officials, waves appeared after a warning was transmitted.
In a recording shared on social media, you can see a man in a building, and he's yelling, "There's a tsunami coming," to warn the people of the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
Because earthquakes have generated general electricity cuts, all the media in Palau have been disrupted, making it difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to authorities, military aid has been sent from Jakarta and other cities on cargo planes, but evacuators still need food and preference.
The city airport has been reopened to facilitate support efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
The President of the game Didodo will visit the Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
Indonesia’s tsunami leaves more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Workers from the World Vision organization in Donggal arrived in the city with no problems (the workers in the area have built canvas shelters in the organisation’s courtyard), but they have seen the terrible situation left behind by the disaster, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "I've seen a lot of broken houses."
That's very bad.
Although support groups continued to deal with sad work repairs in disaster cases, some complained that highly-experienced workers and assistants advised Paul not to go to work.
Following Indonesian legislation, the international financing, supply and personnel supply zone can only start after qualifying as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
It’s still a disaster in the province,” says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Red Cross of Indonesia.
When the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster", we can open the doors to receive international support, but it hasn't been classified yet."
The second night after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, the friends and families of those who had disappeared had not yet lost the hope of experiencing the miraculous chance of their loved ones.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of the sewerage.
On Sunday, a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body close to her.
Gendon Subandono, the national paragliding coach of Indonesia, trained two of the paragliding squads who were part of the extinct Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others stayed at the Roa Hotel, including Mandagi J., were students.
As an expert in the world of paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Jr. explained in the paragliding community that within the hours following the collapse of the Roa Hotel, WhatsApp messages were sent to the contestants, who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only reached a single gray arrow, no two blue marks.
I think that means that these messages were not sent,” he added.
The thieves stole $26,750 while they were filling up automated ATMs in Newport on the Leve
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from an employee who was filling an automatic ATM in Newport on the Brink, according to news from the Police Department of Newport.
The car driver was emptying the ATM in the complex entertainment and getting ready to deliver more money, writes Detective Dennis McCarthy in a statement.
While working, another man attacked the Brink worker and stole a bag of the money he was going to deliver.
The witnesses saw several suspects escape the stage, as indicated in the announcement, but the police did not specify the number of participants who had taken part by surprise.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact the Police of Newport at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raperoa has changed its name, Y is now
Kanye West rape has changed its name - now it's Ye.
On Saturday he announced the change on Twitter: "The creature who was known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has used the pseudonym Y for some time, and has used this evil as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
He made the change before appearing in Saturday Night Live, because no one expected Yandhi to present his latest album.
He took part in the show instead of Ariana Grande, the creator of the show said that he could not participate because of “emotional reasons”.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used in the Bible and "you" means "you" in the Bible," said West recently, talking about the big boy radio host album.
So it's me, it's me, it's me.
It comes from Kanye, which means only one thing, to become Ye-that makes it a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, and everything.
This work reflects on who we are.
It is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs has also been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has stated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had formerly collaborated with the West, has also changed the dash and the capital letters.
Mexico has promised not to use the army against the people
The President of Mexico, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has promised not to use the force or army against the people when the country is experiencing the 50th year of a repression that was spilled against the students.
López Obrador swore on Saturday that he would never use the army to repress Mexican citizens.
On October 2, 1968, the army fired at a peaceful rally in the square, killing 300 people to stop the rise of left-wing students who were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn with monthly subsidies and open up more free public universities.
In his opinion, unemployment and educational opportunities drive young people into criminal groups.
The U.S. should double the AI funding
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it uses to research in this area, says Kai-Fu Lee, investor and AI expert, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were created when various parties to the U.S. government issued reports about AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to turn AI into the best innovation by 2030.
Double AA research would be a good start because the other countries are far from the US and we are looking for the next AA discovery,” Lee said.
Double funding may double the chances of large AI discoveries in the US, says Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who has researched in one of the most important companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that surpassed the American high-level Othello player, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research, and served as Google's president in the Chinese field.
Lee praised previous technology contests from the US government, including the Robotic Competition of the Advanced Research Agency of Defense Projects, and asked when the next will be done to help identify the next dreamers.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, says Lee.
It doesn’t mean that China leads academic leaders, it’s companies,” Lee added.
Facebook, Google and many other technology companies have taken the most intelligent of the universities to act in the AA in recent years.
Lee also said that changing immigration policies would help the United States to boost AI activities.
I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI,” he said.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China launched the next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Science Foundation of China finances people from academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government institutions in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense created an Artificial Intelligence Centre where industrial and educational partners met and the White House announced that it had set up an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI NEXT initiative.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in AI research per year.
Meanwhile, the EU legislation for the creation of the National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in recent months.
The Macedonians had a referendum to decide whether or not to change the name of the country.
The country of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether or not to change the name of the "Old Republic of Macedonia", which would end the conflict in several decades, when Greece blocked the possibility of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, formerly a province called Macedonia, still claims to occupy its own territory and block the possibility of its incorporation into NATO and the EU.
The government of both countries came to an agreement based on the proposed new name in June, but the nationalist rivals argue that this change is detrimental to the ethnic identity of most Yugoslav citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott he had made in the campaign caused doubts about whether 50 percent of the vote should be achieved in order to be valid.
The question that could be read on the paper of the referendum is: "Are you supporting NATO and EU membership with the Greek consensus?"
People who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim to deserve access to the EU and NATO institutions for Macedonia, which is one of the countries established when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
I’m here to vote for the future of the country, young Macedonians, because this will lead to a safer life under the umbrella of the European Union in order to live free,” said Olivera Georgijevska, aged 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, members of parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote in order to decide.
Three-thirds of Parliament will be required to change its name.
The national selection committee stated that no surprises had been reported until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, it has only voted 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary election in 2016, in which 66 percent of voting rights were voted.
I went to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, aged 62, voter Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zora and his son Dushkok changed the country's name in the Macedonian referendum and became eligible to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumican, Macedonia.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, aged 54, wanted to boycott a small stage and a referendum on climbing the stairs.
We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to meet in our own communities and not in the door of our servers," said Kavardarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to be as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia, and we can be a part of the Euro-Asia union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO can bring such investment into Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
I think the majority will be on the side, because more than 80 percent of the population is on the side of the EU and NATO,” said Zaev after the vote.
He said, “Yes” would confirm our future.
According to the survey published by the Macedonia Political Research Organisation on Monday, it would take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – less than necessary.
Another survey of the Macedonian Telma TV reported that 57 percent of residents thought they would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said he would leave.
In order to be successful, a 50-percent vote must be reached.
If there was a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious failure of the West since May.
See: The Manchester City team’s Sergio Agero beat all Brighton’s defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated all of Brighton's defences in the 2–0 Saturday victory for Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium football field in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goal maker took a walk in the middle of the pitch at the start of the game.
He ran among three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
All of a sudden he saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed one defender after he had run away from many others on the edge of Brighton.
Then he walked on to the left and there was Sterling.
The English forward gave the ball back to Aguero in the first touch, and he used his right foot with a shot aimed at the right side of the Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
There are a lot of problems going on at the foot of the evening," said City's coach, Pep Guardiola.
We said it would be 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were very pleased to have scored that moment.”
But Sterling gave the jerseys the starting advantage of competing in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in the playing area of Brighton.
He took a good walk on the left side of Leroy Sane.
San touched a few touches to the far pole before leading Sterling to the post.
The blue jersey pushed the ball to the grid before leaving the line.
He will compete against City Hoffenheim in the Champions League competition on Tuesday, at 12:55 p.m., at the Rhein-Neckkar-Arena football field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Schezer wants to ruin the end of the rockies.
Out of competition, there was little reason to force him to another start.
Nevertheless, Schezer always wants to take advantage of the competitive advantage against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but still experience the same effects as Rockie, who still have the advantage of a game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
Rockie has won a joke winning at least 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but they still have to try to win first-class title.
If we play for nothing, we know that at least the atmosphere of Denver will be full of people, and that the opposing team will play at the best level in all areas that we are going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher, but it looks as if they're going to let Schezer in that situation.
Schezer, who would launch his 34th launch, launched a launch session on Thursday and seems to be acting as a striker on Sunday.
Washington's right hand has reached 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in the 220 2/3 innings this year's season.
Trump Statements in West Virginia
The president reviewed the situation above and referred to the situation of the Supreme Court's elected Brett Kavanaugh as he was talking about the importance of the participation of the Republicans in the mid-season election.
Everything we have done is in play in November.
We have five weeks of the most important elections of our lives.
He's one of the greats -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for big candidates," he said.
Trump added, “You can see the terrible extreme group of Democrats, you can see what’s going on right now.
And they do not doubt the power to use any means necessary to eliminate them, see avarice, see ignition.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they go over and get control and power, for we don’t give them that.
The Democrats, he said, have a purpose of "sustaining and preventing".
As you can see in the last four days," he said.
He was appointed Senator for the Democratic Party, Dianne Feinstein, of the Senate Court, who received the audience's shouts.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one - the wrong body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The laborers will not continue to have a great deal of scope.
It’s intolerant to what they think.
When the activists of the moment voted against me from my local party, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last one on the list that we didn't welcome from the Labour MPs -- for saying what we all thought.
John Ryan, a member of parliament, also received a similar treatment because he spoke for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor's motion criticised me for refusing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security in Europe, Jeremy was disagreed with the previous leaders in similar matters.
News on the Eastern Nottingham meeting on Friday said “We want to have meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For eight years as a local Labour MP, that was Friday night's GC meetings.
Unfortunately, today the word “pleasant, respectful” has not been remembered if it has ever existed.
It shows that there are different approaches to the Labour Party and opinions are judged that are acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This began when Jeremy became the leader, when our previous members of the same political vision had turned over 180 degrees and began to ask for visions that I would never accept – both national and EU security in terms of the single market.
Every time I spoke to the public -- it doesn't matter what I was saying -- a lot of social media policies are accusing and depriving me of, it turns out, in the sense that they say I shouldn't be on the Labour side.
That's not just my experience.
I know I have better luck than some of my colleagues, because my opinions against me are always political.
Every day I rely on professionals and honesty in the persecutions of sexism or racism, but never on shame.
One of the most distasteful aspects of the policy of this time is that the current level of bullying is considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn stated last week that the Labour Party should promote the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we don’t get a single opinion in every ‘untrusted’ motion or when the Party’s rules become more pronounced.
In the last two years I've received several notes to lower my head, not to speak so much, and thus, "I'd be fine."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I was forced by the government of Thatcher to abandon the room and join the most needed public services – as a local councilor or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will be in doubt about my current political views and disagreements with current leaders.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, I would tell our homes, businesses and public services that when they are heading towards Brexit, I don’t understand how to waste my time and energy in the discussion of loyalty with Labour Party leaders.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to be part of the Labour Party: I’m very proud to work for you and I promise you that from continuing to work for what is best for you, they won’t take me away from threats or political records.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is the leader who has not yet lost the game
The two final surprise attempts somehow changed the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved to win in a match on the day of the wonderful and fun tenent tournament.
They are in the first place on the board, and they are the only ones who have not lost a single match of ten.
At the end of the day, they had a better defense, and they took better chances, and the housekeeper and coach Peter Murchie have the right to be happy.
We've been tested so far, and we haven't lost any, so we have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie in Melros added, "My honors to Ayr because they used better options than us."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, materialized by Frazier Climo, preceded Ayr, but the yellow ticket drawn by Captain Rory Hughes left by Warriors for the game allowed him to add points to Melrosi and Jason Baggot did not make the attempt.
Climo blocked the Ayr leader by penalty. Prior to finishing the first part, he performed one-on-one test and Ayr went to a break by 17–5.
But Melrose began in the second half and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, carried out by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there was a long pause due to the serious injury of player Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out of bed and when he returned to the game, Ayr came further when Stafford McDowall's rehearsal turned Climo's.
Then the captain of the Blair Macpherson Ayr took out his yellow card, and again Melros profited from the fact that he had one more man, with the attempt of Bruce Colvine, who had not carried out, at the very end of his life.
The family returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got his yellow card out to prevent Clima from hitting the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the forward Ayr band's hammer.
Climo scored, as he had done almost from the beginning, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and drove Gregor Henry's wing out in the fifth attempt by the family.
Still Game series star to start a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran seems to want to jump into the host world, as he is known to have been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actress plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's most famous performance, with Greg Hemphill, whose writer and one of the stars he has long been a member of.
The couple announced that the next season will be the end of the show, the ninth, and it seems that Kiernan Craiglangen is planning a future life.
According to official records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress did not want to say anything about the story, although sources from Scottish Sun magazine said she wanted to join Kiernan Glasgow in a “signature of important restaurants”.
‘The sea is ours’: the interior Bolivia expects the courts to reopen the way to the Pacific
The main service station for seafaring equipment in La Paz.
The public buildings have a blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to Amazon, you can read the following slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to get it back."
During the interior Bolivia, the multi-blooded coastal conflicts of Chile still survive – they continue to wish to sail back in the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps these hopes are stronger than they have been in recent decades, as Bolivia expects to resolve international courts after five years of reflection on 1 October.
Bolivia lives the right moment, with a sense of unity and tranquility, and, of course, waits for the result positive,” Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will continue their international court decision through large distributed screens across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will give rise to Bolivia's demands - after decades of negotiations - as Chile has been forced to negotiate on the sovereign route to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charming indigenous president of Bolivia – who is involved in the struggle to be re-elected next year – has also made several contributions to Monday’s resolution.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he said at the end of August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia and therefore will not change much.
The United Nations, located in the Netherlands, has no power to provide the territory of Chile and has stated that it will not decide on the results of any possible negotiations.
The resolution of the International Court six months later indicates that the case was "not difficult", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than promoting the cause of Bolivia, they have been back in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has taken the issue of reaching the sea as a captive," said Zarate.
The rhetoric of President Morales, the Belgian, has ruined all the desire to do well that remained in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile still have a number of issues to deal with, but it will be very difficult to continue arguing after that.
The two countries have not exchanged their ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, disagrees with those who say that the court's resolution is particularly quick.
On Monday, Bolivia said, "It will be a great opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "to put an end to the 139 years of disagreement, both for good."
Calzadilla stated that it is not agreed that Morales – still one of the popular presidents in South America – is using the question of the sea to get political support.
Bolivia will never give up the right to travel to the Pacific,” she added.
The decision we should have seen is the opportunity to overcome the past.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can believe in the US
The North Korean Minister, Ri Yong Hok, says his country will not be disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
The United Nations General Assembly said so.
He asked the United States at the summit of Singapore, in front of the enemy's leaders, to fulfill his promise.
Mike Pompeo, secretary of the United States of Singapore, noted that he is confined to re-blocking nuclear diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un for more than three months.
Rik says that " Utopia" is to think that the continued sanctions and the US's objections to the end of the Korean War will place North Korea at his feet.
Washington doesn't want to agree to Pyongyang's withdrawal of weapons before making any move.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's a lot of skepticism about the only way that the country seems to have to guarantee its security around Pyongyang.
Pompey's plan next month is to go to Pyongyang to arrange the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show shows the newest line of massive hats on your way to the High Street
If you want to increase your collection of hats or block the sun completely, here is the answer.
Designers Valentino and Tom Browne presented a series of large-sized jewelry hats in their 2019 spring collection, which left the style of the Fashion Week in Paris quivering.
In the summer, Instagram has arrived, and these designers have taken their spectacular designs to the passage.
The most notable pieces of Valentino, with a beix-colored cap with a feather-like wing, covered the heads of the models.
Among other large-sized supplements we have a kind of jewel-filled angrus, a rather strange hat, and even a pin-type -- but they are not head-warming designs.
Thom Brown also exhibited a collection of strange masks – on time for Halloween.
Many masks full of colors have their lips covered and they look like those of Hannibal Lecter than the top-class tailor-mades.
One looked like a diving mask, with glasses and tubes, while the other one looked like an ice cream cone.
If you are a fashion follower, you have good news.
In style, experts say that haters are going to go out, even to your surroundings.
Large-sized hats follow the ‘La Bomba’, a two-foot wide-wing straw hat, which we have seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural mark behind the hat that has not been practical at all in social networks has brought another object to the passage – a straw bag on the beach, almost as large as the model in the bathtub it has.
The Raffles orange bag, cut with swivel fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the protagonist of the 2019 spring collection La Riviera in Paris Fashion Week at Jacquemus.
Celebrities stylist Luke Armitage said in FEMALE: “I hope the great hats and beach bags reach the main streets the next summer, with the great echo the designer has had it would be difficult to ignore the demand for giant supplements.”
John Edward as Basic Language Skills for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland register academic excellence and continue in 2018 with the extraordinary results of their studies, which have solidified with both individual and team results in sports, art, music and other projects within the community.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to train students for higher education, their chosen careers and citizens.
Since we can design and implement a custom school curriculum as an educational sector, we have seen that modern languages follow the usual choice of students.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak in a language that understands someone, you’ll get to yourself.
If you speak to him in his language, you will come to his heart.
It is a powerful way to remember that we do not only need to build relationships with people from other countries and use English to gain confidence in them.
This year we can see from the results of the latest studies that there are languages at the top of the most advanced independent schools.
68 percent of students who study foreign languages have achieved the highest A ranking.
The data, collected at the SCIS 74 school, shows that 72 percent of students had the best A ranking in Chinese Mandarin; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that Scottish independent schools see foreign languages without a doubt as an essential ability for young people and children to need.
Languages are currently being worked on as the focus of subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums.
In 2014 a survey by the EU Commission found that one of the main reasons for filling the job was linguistic ignorance.
More and more, knowing the language is becoming essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in the global world.
Whatever their chosen career, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifetime advantage.
The ability to speak directly to foreign peoples will automatically put the multilingual person at the head of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov of 4,000 adults in the EU, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language in such a way as to be an ordinary conversation, and only those speaking in French rose to two-digit figures, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in teaching languages in today’s children.
Talking more than one language, mostly used in economic development, will give your child more opportunities to find better employment.
In Scotland, they differ according to the language they teach.
One number of students prefer more classical modern languages, while others prefer that they appear to be relevant to the EU for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, there will always be a wide range of languages available at an independent school with expert teachers in the field.
The aim of independent schools in Scotland is to train and provide children with tools to succeed in the future.
This time, we cannot deny that in an international business environment, where languages are essential for the future of the country, so we need to reflect on education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunities, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I love their faire.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut Monday with Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James, the first-rate star in Los Angeles, is about to wait for the fans to make their debut.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play Monday's preseason game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn’t figured out how many minutes he’ll play.
More than one and less than 48,” said Walton on Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, author of Lakers's journalist, stated on Twitter that James would play with limited time.
After training this week, they asked James about the programme of six pre-season games in the Lakers.
I don’t need to prepare a match for the season at this stage of my career,” he answered.
Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts the rally campaign in Wheeling tonight, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallyes for Trump's next week, and he will visit several places with friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Following the vote that would confirm the completion of the Supreme Court Square, Trump seeks support or support for mid-term elections where Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress in the November elections.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia and how can we see it online?
Trump's tour is scheduled to start in West Virginia at 7:00 p.m. today, September 29, 2018.
You can view the West Virginia Trump online via YouTube stream.
It seems that Trump will be directing the hearings of the so-called Brett Kavanaugh of the Supreme Court this week, as long as you are in a position of invulnerable sexual position until the confirmation of the Senate that has supported the vote during the FBI's investigation.
But the main objective of this rally tour is to help the Republicans win some votes in the November elections.
So President Trump’s campaign says that the next five week’s rally is about encouraging the volunteers and helping to keep up with the majority of the Republican Senate and their representatives at home, according to Reuters.
This is particularly important against Congress, and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," Trump’s campaign spokesman said, who refused to authorize Reuters to register.
Programmed for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today’s rally will allow Ohio and Pennsylvania followers and the Pittsburgh media to be covered, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, a state he won for 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republic of Virginia, who is on the trail.
It’s not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go there to support the election,” Simon Header, scientist politics at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will try to follow in individual competition on Sunday
After three sessions on one side, the Saturday afternoon four had what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is the concept of sports that is invented from top to bottom, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say it's time now?
They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think it's time somehow," said Jordan Spieth, when he had a day's field.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points, from twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel the wind's not on their side, and they need help, mostly Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points in four.
Spieth has been absolutely decisive, from draw to green, and is leading the model.
To celebrate these cries have been getting louder as the rounds have progressed, and it has reached the important pitch, winning four all-square, after Thomas lost two.
He held the 15th match with another scream similar to the whore he won, which means that the American team is not out of competition.
You must look for strength and only take care of your game," said Spieth.
That’s what the players have left.
18 to get out of the hole.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood, historical players of the Ryder Cup tournament.
European special but charming couples are four out of four to see if they can swear off.
The "Moliwood" was the only pair who did not launch a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, the Bogeys were also discontinued and on Friday the last nine.
This turn and the tumultuous crowd turned into a pair of energies to be overcome on Sunday and there was no European player more famous for Fleetwood and Molina when the sun closes when the victory of Europe is at Le Golf National.
It is better to have both of them in different holes.
It’s too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio García's work, the best of four when he was tied with Alex Noren.
One and two Bogeys have been placed ahead of them in a hole that was never too close to Spanish and Swedish to defeat them.
However, on Sunday, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The quartet was fascinated to see the couple's interaction close by, the advice they gave, the advice they didn't give, and in a moment how the strategy can be changed.
Europe played better as a team and had a notable advantage in the final, but the US team's try showed that it has the courage to fight, although some in particular called into question America.
Europe reaches a 10-6 advantage in the Ryder Cup final
Europe has achieved a significant advantage in the finals of the Ryder Cup, after the Saturday quarter achieved 10-6 against the United States of America.
The inspirational couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina achieved two major victories against the Tiger Woods and achieved four valuable points in the National Golf Championship to date.
Thomas Bjorn, part of Europe, was dominant in the morning trying to recover the lost prize in Hazelin two years ago, winning the 3-1 series.
The United States offered greater resistance and won two games, but they were unable to overcome the difference.
It took Jim Furyk eight points to hold the prize in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to win four consecutive points and together with Molinari, who is referred to as "Molliwood" after a brilliant weekend, are the second in four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After breaking up the Fourball Woods and Patrick Reed, the game was played beautifully with the 5th and 4th light that survived the tired Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, after playing two matches in one way or another, showed a touch of excellence, but he lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and four-somes in a row of 7.
Justin Rose rested for the morning four-ball and returned with Henrik Stenson to defeat the quartet 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the best and third in the world.
Europe did not find its way on a pleasant, fresh day in south-west Paris.
Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas established a two-point reference for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a 2–1 dim victory over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and then passed the Pauler and Rory McIlroy after losing two initial holes in the 4&3 quadruple.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has only managed to cross the four points and enter the individual ones, although Fury's side only needed a draw to hold the prize.
After two days of being the second best, after Sunday's anti-improvement, they will be preceded by him.
North Korea refuses to lay down arms without trust
The foreign minister of North Korea warned the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continue to hinder their trust in the United States and will not, under any circumstances, stop making nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the World's annual World Organization that Korea had adopted "significant measures of good intentions" last year to disrupt nuclear weapons and missile testing, to leave nuclear testing places, and to pledge to stop developing nuclear weapons.
We don’t see the right answer from the US,” he said.
Without the trust of the US, there is no trust in our national security and in no case can we leave only the first weapons."
Rick repeats family complaints about Washington's resistance as part of a "phase" process in which North Korea would be rewarded by gradual steps. His statements seem to have not been ruled out in the past by unilateral denucleization in Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump refer to the first summit of President of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. Kim then pledged to "unclean the Korean Peninsula", and Trump swore to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is looking for a formal way to end the Korean War between 1950–1953, but the United States of America has stated that Pyongyang must leave its first weapons.
Washington ignores the international voices that demand relief from North Korea's sanctions.
Again, the U.S. states that it will have to abandon its first weapons and continue to increase the pressure level of sanctions to force them to achieve their goal and that it is against the “final declaration of war” said Ri.
The thought that punishments will set us at their feet is a utopia that we are not familiar with.
The problem is that continuing punishments are increasing disfiguring.”
Rick has not mentioned the second peak between Kim and Trump, announced by the United Nations leader at the beginning of the week.
The Minister, on the other hand, has mentioned three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and adds: “The other side would not be blocked by the dehumanization of the Korean peninsula if it were South Korea instead of the United States.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be quite different in the past year, when he stated that North Korea was facing the US at the UN Plenary, since President Trump called Kim "the "master missile" on a suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who declared that he would “crush” North Korea, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to remove weapons, but stated that it still had to be done and that they would continue with sanctions until North Korea was dehumanized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have time to do so, "even though it is KBI years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should be awarded Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
But the Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, stated in front of the UN Security Council on Thursday that “it is necessary to continue strengthening the sanctions of the Security Council until we verify that its denuclearization is true”.
The Security Council has unanimously promoted North Korea's sanctions as an attempt to block the funding of nuclear and ballistic programs in Pyongyang since 2006.
Pompeo Ri met outside the UN Plenary and later announced that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last voyage did not go well.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, saying that he had achieved something only for North Korea, after reporting that during the hours this was "requests from gangsters."
North Korea swore at a meeting with Moon that they would leave places of missiles and a nuclear complex if the United States took the appropriate measures for them.
Kim had told him that "the measures that correspond to them" were the security guarantees set by Trump in Singapore and he had focused on the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take the course to rest long enough.
This year at Harvard University, she will be sleeping more and more to try to cope with the growing culture of those who learn to drink coffee at night.
One of the professors found that at the best university in the world, a prize is lost in a way that takes care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham's and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first such in the EU.
He began his course as a speaker on the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl approached me and said, "Why should I do this alone now in the last year of my school?"
Nobody told him how important it is to sleep, and that surprised me,” Telegraph said.
In the course, for the first time, students are told about the impact of appropriate sleeping habits on their studies and sports outcomes, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric and university health services at Harvard Medical School, stated that the university had decided to start the course when students observed that he slept very little during the week.
The long-hour course covers many interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room in which students can see the impact of coffee pots, curtains, trainers and books on caffeine and light, and note the importance of sleeping too little in sports performance.
In the other section, participants are told that sleeping too little can beat the heart, and may increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On a campus map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to think about everyday habits.
We know that we will not suddenly change our students’ habits.
But we believe that they have the right to know, if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as a right to know the consequences that this will have on your health,” Czeisler added.
There is still a culture of pride to "nighting" and it increases the problem of increasing pressures on modern technologies and students.
Sleep well, with good quality sleep, should be the “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and nervousness,” he said, even to gain weight, because little sleep puts the brain in the form of hunger and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, has helped Czeisler to design his course, and one of his first classes in the first year of Harvard.
He stated that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to participate in a full campus course.
The next step, he expects, would be to apply for a peer-research to graduate students before entering the competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm to determine when to go to bed, as well as to grind it, and to know the effects of the adverse effect of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can change circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeats the men of Gerrard
The Rangers have suffered another defeat in Livingston that Dolly Menga's strike set 1-0 for Steven Warrd's strike.
The Ibrox team wanted to win for the first time after winning 4-1 St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holte's team hit the second defeat of the Warr in his 18th game as a coach, leaving his eight points uncontrolled by the Hearts of the Landbrokes Championship leaders.
The menga had seven minutes before the strike break, and Rangers's work failed to draw.
The Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, while Livingston has risen to third and are only behind Hibernian goals.
The problem could have been more serious because for Rangers they had to treat the Calum Spencer wing for a head wound because of an object that was thrown outside.
Warr made eight changes and managed to reach the finals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11, who took away one point last week from the Hearts and would be happy to see his well-adjusted garments smothered at each turn.
Rangers dominated the property, but Livingstone benefited from their games.
The goal scored by Scott Pittmani Allan McGregor on the slope of the Menga should be scored but the midfielder did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw at Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to get him away to the rear post.
Rangers took control, but in the last third they seemed to have more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he must be a criminal on the quarter-end, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian claims.
Rangers managed to make only two strikeouts in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head and the light hit of Ovie Ejara.
Livy's first goal entered in the 34th minute might have damaged the game's progress, but no one can deny that they were worth a lot of effort considering.
Again, Rangers failed to stop playing Jacobs' ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Warr intervened in a break with Coolival Ryan Kent, and the change had immediate effect when the wing passed over to Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran off her line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game, playing long after the long rides, with Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had an opportunity to increase its advantage, but McGregor held him firmly before the idea that came from Lithgow Corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton called for a penalty again in the end when he stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanaka: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now our "Sunday Morning" German page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and TIME GO... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity: after that invention came what is known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a milestone in science, and has also become a milestone in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bels of Coronado", with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as the unfavorable cowboys:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger counter, used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you install these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms caused by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: “Yes, you can hear it right now!”
Hans" Geiger died in 1945 when he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to 'see' and kill evil cells
Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells during treatment
Method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then alter it in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common in many cancers and then regenerated
Test vaccine is giving very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with vaccine that teaches the immune system how to recognize malignant cells has managed to get cancer from the ovarian population for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and alterating them in the laboratory in order to "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then reinjecting cells.
Jay Berzofsky, the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to "learning" from patients to immune cells and how to get to carcinogenic cells has worked during the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye entered a distillery in favor of West Trump, wearing a MAG hat after the SNL outbreak.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shouted in the studio when Donald Trump praised Donald Trump as president at a Saturday Night Live and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to protest the Democrats and reaffirmed Trump's support.
Every time I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, because he's a racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have been away a long time ago from America," he said.
SNL started the session with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood stars were ridiculed by Brett Kavanaugh on the basis of allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford against the Senate Committee.
Despite not being broadcast, West's offensive talk was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock West was trying to make fun of it.
He also complained to the West public that he had been having a bad time between the wings because of his hat.
I have been attacked in the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a place where I'm wrecked," Washington Examiner said.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place where the bottom is down?" and said, "I'm going to wear my superman's cloak, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do.
Test your love."
As a result of his words, at least a couple of times they came from the public and the members of the SNL session seemed embarrassed, Variety said to the magazine, "The entire studio was completely silent."
West was brought to replace Ariana Grande, who had died a few days before, the rapper Rac Miller.
The Web surprised many people with the interpretation of I love it, dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the TUSA conservative group, who published the tweet: "One of the bravest spirits: thank you for dealing with the Mafia."
But as the interviewer Karen Hunter tweeted, West simply was "just like he was, and that's wonderful."
But I do NOT want to reward a person who makes an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying their music or clothes or by protecting their “art”).
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the session, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was "an entity that had until now been known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change the name, and follows the footsteps of Diddy, as he is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dog has also been called Snoop Lion, and how not to mention the late Prince legend, which changed his name to a symbol and made him an artist until then.

Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington opposes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO Medieval Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has opposed the stereotype of the sexist hero, stating that as a result of the appearance of such papers on the screen, young boys often feel that they need to be hard to respect.
In his statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought something was ‘failed’ and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the time of #MeToo.
Kit also recently married the star of Game of Thrones and is 31 years old to Rose Leslie, and admitted that he has to deal with the problem of ‘belief’.
‘Personally, and with great certainty, at this moment I think – what have we done wrong with masculinity?’ he said.
‘What have we taught men when they are growing up, taking into account the problem that we now see?’
Kit believes that television can also be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity as a result of very masculine characters.
He continued: ‘What is it and what is it taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, what makes young men feel like they have to do it?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time. How can we change that?
Something went wrong with young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make any predecessors or successors of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he ‘has finished with battlefields and horses’.
As of November, Kit Sam Shepard's return to True West is the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently announced that his wife, Rose, had been known to be the best thing that Game of Thrones had given him.
I met my wife in this session so she gave me my future family and life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Y Gritte, the woman who loves the character Jon Snow in Kit, who won the Emmy Award in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, health authorities have said.
More than 40,000 new cases have been registered in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spreads due to blood transfusions in certain areas of China.
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China every year has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to conservative values in the country, it has been estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are married to a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases occur when inappropriate sexual protection occurs.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to deal with this problem.
Maxine Waters rejected the data from the GOP Senators leaked by workers and turned them upside down with ‘harmless lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
On Saturday, Maxine Waters reports that a member of her team published personal information from three U.S. Republicans on legislative Wikipedia.
Los Angeles Democrats have stated that confirmations were promoted by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
More lies, more lies, more slanderous lies,” Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The published information contained information from three U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday in a hearing of allegations from an unknown person regarding the inappropriate sexual behaviour against Brett Kavanaugh, who is a candidate to the Supreme Court of the Senate, published by Capitol Hill.
The leak was questioned by the three senators in Kavanaugh and later arrived.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was associated with the Waters office and published information from a member of the Waters team, Hill stated.
That unfounded claim is absolutely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
The members of my team – who have been placed at risk of identity, personal information and security due to these false allegations of fraud – are not responsible for any kind of leaking of such information.
An unfounded claim is a completely false and complete lie.
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online by the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
This refusal was made from anger," wrote Fleischer.
This shows that he has no status as a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of doing something that he did not do, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to show any defiant behavior.
He should not question the cause of the accuser.
He must appear calm and good-tempered."
Fleischer seemed to want to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats against Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of having appeared too angry on Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate in the central elections to remove Waters, expressed his views on Twitter.
If the significance is true," he murmured.
In his statements, Waters said that his office warned "that the authorities and the bodies responsible for the execution of the law were fit for these fraudulent statements.
We make sure that those who break the law know that they are," he went on, "and that they must answer before the law for any member of my team and any action that is harmful and dangerous to all members of me."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of the power spy Rowan Atkinson
Now traditional has become the search for the meaning of Brexit in any new British film, which seems to be not applicable to the franchise of the Johnny English action comedy. It started in 2003, with Johnny English, and returned again in 2011.
What kind of trash is it that shows us how much we are doing with the satire of ourselves will we get a new export option for our nation?
In any case, Johnny English has renewed his license to spoil things with large, rubber-faced eyes for the second time: his name over all things shows that it is only a wide-ranging creation designed for non-English film territories.
Despite his special desire to get flattering glamorous glamorous, he is, of course, a dumb secret agent that resembles Clouse, as well as a ray of Mr Bean and a bit of the boy who accompanies Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony at the 2012 Olympics in London.
In Barclaycard's commercials we have already forgotten, Atkinson is also based on the mysterious traveler and international man, leaving chaos behind.
There’s one or two of them on this last trip.
I liked Johnny English when he came up to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor's crosses patted his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to comedy is seen on the screen, but humor is too powerful and too superfluoe, especially when "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy among their ingredients.
Humor seems to be more than intended for adults, and for me Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as witty and clever as the Bean character in Atkinson’s silent films.
The ongoing topical premise now is that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has been infiltrated in the secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents working, and is upset about the fact that he is in the service, unfortunately small paper for Kevin Eldon.
This is too much for a prime minister with a pompous and persecuted character, who is already completely losing political reputation: Emma Thompson gives the best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the script does not help much.
His intelligence advisors inform him that since all active spies are at risk, he will have to recover someone who is in retirement.
And this means that Johnny English is able to walk the same way he can. He is now a teacher in a fancy place, but he is giving confidential lessons in dealing with hidden operations: there are some nice jokes, which English offers a ‘school of Rock’ spy academy.
English is once again being taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, and meets again with his former partner, Bough, who is once again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to an underwater commander, who loses Vicki Pepperdine in that role that is a bit rich.
So in the Secret Service of Your Highness, Batman and Robin are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is impressed by the fact that he says he can fix the computer problems of Britain, a sly millionaire Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their farce adventures: disguised as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, creating chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxurious yacht, and English produces a complete anarchy when it tries to use virtual reality helmets to see what Volta's house looks like inside.
All the stops are watched by this last sequence, but although it is pleasant and noisy, all of them have a lot of children’s TV.
That's kind of like it.
And as with other films in Johnny English, I have come to think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role worth his talents?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are working four days a week but are preparing a plan for a five-day payment.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that plans to work with the British in a day-to-day, but which costs five days.
It seems that the main company wants to give employees the savings by means of an artificial intelligence revolution, giving them one more holiday.
The workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take the same salary home.
Sources have stated that the idea "well penetrates" the economic agenda of the party and that the country wants to support the workers.
Spending four working days a week has been supported by the Trade Unions Congress as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official has told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is anticipated before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen from one day to the next, but there is a week of four working days that matches the vision of the Party to redefine the workers’ economy, and the general industrial strategy of the party.’
The Labour Party would not be the party that supports such an idea, as the Green Party defended the four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not yet received support from the whole Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The working week is not a party policy, and the party does not take it into account.’
Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's congress last week to discuss his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said, no doubt, that "leaders without faces" and " speculators" had to be removed from power in companies that offered public services.
In the shadow minister's plans, the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their full share if they find that there has been a misbehaves in a Labour government.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to incorporate personnel into business management and create Inclusive Property Funds to provide 10 percent of the private sector’s capital to workers, who could charge up to £500 years of dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 Minutes" to FBI's study of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation of charges against Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and placed his doubt on the table whether the results of the investigation could imply the removal of his support by a Republican Senator.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change his mind.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his counterpart in South Carolina.
I think so," said Kennedy.
I said, "When I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, told him to make a statement, I said, 'Did you do that?'
He answered firmly, clearly, without a doubt."
Graham's vows, however, seem to be written on stone.
I've decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and he'd be in charge of an explosion," he said.
Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone he mentioned could have proven that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new has changed."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event with an extraordinary presence and mission: the revitalization of global poverty.
With the seventeenth edition, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Grand Field of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real objective of the event, namely extreme poverty before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international promotion group that expects poverty to increase the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free ticket for the event (if you are not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), those who want to attend the concert need to do various tasks or “actions”, such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or calling in another valid way to help raise awareness about the poverty.
What has become of the success of Global Citizen when he is 12 years old to fulfill his purpose?
Is this the original idea of asking people to perform an action through a free concert, or is it just another case of what is called “clicktivism”, meaning that they feel they are making a real change by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed that it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its followers, putting pressure on several targets to meet.
According to the World Leader, these actions have encouraged the announcement of policies and commitments of more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and predictions derived from the actions, of which at least 10 billion have already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and implementers committed to "help their children develop their full potential", with headquarters in the United Kingdom." He has promised to donate to Rwanda $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizen, we will make the social injustice of malnutrition into history,” said The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman, in a live concert held in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced that the Power Nutrition project would be funded by 5 million women and children who will be assisted by the intervention of nutrition.
In response to their FAQs on the website, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we too will achieve, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be present at the shows of this year’s New York event, featuring Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the military to slow down Russian energy exports as a "block" - Secretary of the Interior
Washington could use its military to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, as stated by US interior secretary Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinc has stated that Russia's relationship with Syria is obviously operating as a legitimate government requires - it's just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I think they want to negotiate with energy as they do in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means of managing it.
The United States, with our Army, have the ability to ensure that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinc was talking to the participants of an event organised by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, an event organised by a non-profit group that introduces itself as the “voice of consumer energy” in the United States.
Washington compared his approaches to interacting with Russia and Iran, clarifying them in the end that they were the same.
The economic choice we have in Iran and Russia is approximately to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-movement” economy with fossil fuels.
Trump’s administration to promote its export of liquefied natural gas to Europe and the declarations that have come to replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump’s administrative officials, and the U.S. president Donald Trump, try to persuade Germany to leave the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which makes Moscow “captivating” according to Berlin Trump.
Moscow repeatedly insists that the €11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing gas capacity to reach 110 billion cubes, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin says that Washington's strong opposition to the project is merely caused by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we agree that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, following a meeting held in Moscow with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
The U.S. attitude has received negative reception from Germany and reaffirms its commitment to the project.
The main organization of the German industry, the German Federation of Industry, has asked the United States not to enter into EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our supply of energy,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), Chancellor Angela Merkel, and President Vladimir Putin, after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren "will examine in depth" presentation of the presidency in 2020, said Massachusetts Senate
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider a "in depth" presidential presentation after mid-election.
While in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would examine the presentation.
It’s time for women to get to Washington and repair our broken government, which requires a woman upstairs, according to The Hill.
After the 6th of November, I’ll look deeply into the presentation of the President.
Warren gave an opinion on Donald Trump in the City Hall, stating that "the country was heading the wrong way."
I’m very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been clear about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in his critique.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
In any case, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren's voters do not believe that he should be running for president in 2020.
Forty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator should not run a presidential session, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Twenty-two per cent were in favour of the presentation.
According to the survey, the possibility of presenting former Governor Deval Patrick is more protective, as 38 percent have supported a potential presentation and 48 percent have opposed it.
Other names in terms of a possible 2020 presentation include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make the decision by January, as Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder in Track Palin during the Donald Trump election event
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday night.
For the sake of what my son is suffering from, for what he is suffering when he comes back, I feel identified with the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and other vulnerable families that our soldiers bring back,” he told Donald Trump to the public at an election event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that the arrest was "significant" and said about his son and other war veterans that he "returned slightly, they come back hardened, other soldiers who are members of the army and other members of the Air Force ask if there is any such respect for what the country has given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, including a declaration of domestic violence and possession of a weapon, according to police spokesman Dan Bennett Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support the inroads of the new asylum policy
Eighty states and the District of Columbia are supporting legal inroads against a new US policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence or bandits.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friendly statement to support a asylum seeker in Washington on Friday, defying the police, NBC News reports.
The full name of the petitioner for Grace V. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been disclosed.
He said his partner "and members of his violent band" had been sexually abused, but U.S. officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of the state who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as creating a large number of asylum seekers from the United States, which are countries with widespread problems with domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States revoked a decision adopted by the Committee of Immigration Appeals, which allowed those who were fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum from undocumented migrants.
According to a statement by the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, "the new police ignores the state, federation, and international law of the years."
The federal law states that all asylum applications must be assigned based on circumstances and facts of the request, and a bar like this violates this principle," said the statement of amicus curiae.
In addition, lawyers argued in writing that the policy that disallows immigrants from the U.S. economy is more likely to become entrepreneurship and to offer “the work-hand needed”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and band violence in June.
Asylum is available for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of being part of a race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion,” said Sessions on June 11.
The asylum itself has never been to solve all the problems that everyone experiences every day, despite the serious problems.
Attempts to make desperate rescue in Palau, while doubling the number of deaths, in order to find the survivors in the race.
For those who survived, the situation became more and more serious.
It feels a lot of tension," said her 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who had fevered while relaxing her son in the destruction of the city of Palo.
He brings ambulances every minute.
There is no clean water.
The inhabitants have seen them return to their destroyed homes, take their own water-contained things, try to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, broken by 7.5 earthquakes, overflowed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with broken back and shoulder, took refuge outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to continuous replication.
Tears fell from his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake in the hotel when he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I stepped against the ruins of the wall," said Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
I heard my wife asking for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or her daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "attacking" with propaganda advertisements
After a four-page advertisement was placed in a US newspaper that supported the mutual benefits of China and the US, the U.S. ambassador has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
The American President Donald Trump cited the additional paid on Wednesday in the second most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after being accused of attempting to enter the U.S. Congressional elections on 6 November. China denies the prosecution.
The accusation that Beijing was trying to enter the US election has been marked by Trump as referring to Reuters by the US officials; a rising campaign in Washington was a new campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked during a growing trade war, in which each country has put thorns on the imports of the other.
Repressive China tariffs, at the beginning of the trade war, were supported by the Trump Republican Party to attack exports from states such as Iowa, China and the U.S. experts stated.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese Ambassador and long-time Governor of Iowa, one of the most widely exported states in China, has stated that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad stated in an article at the Sunday's Des Moines Register that "China is now undermining the attack by putting propaganda ads on our free press".
Dispersing propaganda, he uses a strong tradition of free American press and press freedom by bringing paid advertisements to the Chinese government in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
On the contrary, in the press kiosk located on Beijing Street, there is little dissident voice and there is no true reflection of the different opinions people may have in China regarding the conflicting economic career, because the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular Chinese newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article", but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans ban female voters before mid-legislative elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analyst warns
As many high-ranking Republicans await and defend their candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh against multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned that they will have a decline among women, especially in the upcoming midterm legislative election.
The emotions surrounding this topic have been very intense, and most Republicans are registered to demonstrate they want to continue with the vote.
We can't go back to these accounts," said Professor Maxwell of the University of Syracuse, regarding an article published on The Hill on Saturday.
Reeher has said that she doubts whether the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to support a FBI investigation will be sufficient to reassure voters who are angry.
The women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow, nor will they in November,” said the chief adviser, Karine Jean-Pierre, and the national spokesman for the progressive group Moveon, Washington, D.C., said.
On Friday morning, the protestors cried, "It's coming November!" in front of the Senate, that the republicans who control the Judicial Commission have decided to continue with the appointment of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, despite being there, she stated in the Mic.
‘Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will be out of place,’ said the independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news website.
People say it has already had a great impact; that’s true.
But it may still have a greater impact, especially among women and youth in suburbs that do not have a fixed vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that they often do not like the president even if they do not like to vote.”
Even before Ford made public evidence explaining the details of the sexual assault against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that this could be a decline if the Republicans decided to continue with the ratification.
It has become a great disturbance to the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
It is not a matter of whether the vote, the final vote or Kavanaugh should sit in the chair of the accused, it is also a matter of how the Republicans managed and dealt with the woman,” explained Guy Cecil, the director of the newspaper group that supports the election of “Church USA”.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite divided between the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh at the time of their decision, but more people seem to favor the second.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of participants believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% believed in it, probably or probably by Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed that Kavanaugh probably said much or probably lied in his statement, and 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, and at least another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford had sworn before the Senate Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him while he was drinking when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court's nominees showed her genitals at a party when she was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web wants to launch a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to launch a startup that aims to tackle Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project is a company based on the Solid free software platform of Inrupt, Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about his intention to "impose the world".
We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal data repository” or a POD.
May contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music repository and other personal and professional tools.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser, and all together.
This is a distinguishing online personal data storage device that is entirely dependent on who can access the information of a particular type.
The company calls it "the empowerment of people by data".
According to executive director John Bruce, Irupt, the idea behind it is to provide resources, processes and adequate skills to help put Solid available to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the developers hired to work on the project and a community of programmers volunteers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Irupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not “talking to Facebook and Google about the need to make a complete change when their business models change from day to day.
We're not asking for permission.
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that “the mission is to establish an ecosystem that supports the integrity and quality of the new Solid network and its commercial energy”.
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed the Internet with the creation of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a influential voice on the neutrality of the network.
Even during the implementation of the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
I am very optimistic about this next time on the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Critics of the First World War Victoria Cross
He is honored as the only clergy of the Church of England who received the Victoria Cross as World War I, 100 years later.
The Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, who never knew he had received the highest British honorary award.
A stone of remembrance was displayed by his two grandchildren at a runway in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of her grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "very symbolic" to give his grandfather a prize and display it 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion crossing the Saint-Quentin Canal "with a very close mist under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns".
Then he went quickly to the first fire line, and with the greatest courage led the line forward until he found a cannon alone and threw three of them into the ground.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German lieutenant on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, aged 72, said he knew that his grandfather's actions could never be done by him, but that's a great humiliation.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, established a wreath of flowers after the parade. The parade was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the protection that many people will give him proves to be the courage of a true hero."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig was replaced by
Let’s say you spend all night waking up to see people full of Bellator 206, and then they won’t let you see the main session.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, including six in the main calendar, and was to be broadcast directly at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the UK viewers were shocked when the coverage was transferred to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised when they were awake until the early morning to fight for themselves.
A follower described the change in children’s cartoons as a “bad taste joke” on Twitter.
A government law says this content was inadequate for 6:00 a.m., and they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, the CEO of Bellator’s marketing and communication, said when they were asked about the performance.
Pippa pig, "yes."
The CEO of Bellator, Scott Coker, said that the programming will be studied to account for UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think of repetition, I think we can probably fix it," said Coker.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday, and we can't fix that until we have our next Sunday, Monday at their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of messages went back and forth, and they were not all very nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
It was not, it was a government issue.
I promise you, next time it won't happen again.
We'll put five fights instead of six, as we usually do, and we tried to offer more people, and we made a mistake.
Unfortunately, this is a situation that has happened."
Desert Island Discs as 'Tom Daley' regarding sex
Tom Daley, an Olympian, claims to have grown up feeling down on the other side of sex, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said he didn't realize that "all of them weren't like him."
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne of Radio 4, he said he had spoken to others of "hopeful" about the rights of homosexuals.
He also said that parenting meant making the Olympic games less important.
Former regular program presenter, Kirsty Young, has been taking vacations for several months due to the disease.
After appearing completely lost in the first program of Laverne, Daley said that he felt “appreciated” by the society because he didn’t like boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, the feelings that you are undervalued and different from others have been the real reasons that have given me the capacity to succeed and the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" because he didn't want to disappoint people when he heard about his sexuality.
A sportsman who has won two bronze medals in Olympic games has become a high profile LGTB developer, and used Australian Commonwealth Games participation to ask for more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his views that he felt that he was lucky enough to live openly without having any consequences and that he wanted to give the others "hope."
The three-time world champion said he was in love with a man – an American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “was caught by surprise”.
Daley got married last year with the Oscar winner 20 years older than himself, but said that age difference has not been a problem among them.
He said "when you're so young and so many things happen to you" -- at the age of 14 he went to the Olympic games for the first time and his father died with cancer three years later -- it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through similar incidents.
The couple became parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley has said that his "full outlook" has changed.
If you had asked me last year, ‘I have to win a gold medal’ was all I had in mind,’ he said.
And, you know, there are more important things than gold medals in Olympic games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert. He died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept him to die, and that one of the last things he asked was whether he had tickets for the 2012 London Games because he wanted to be on the front line.
I couldn't say, "You're not supposed to be on the front line, Dad," he said.
I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing, and I did not accept that she was not invincible until she died.
The following day, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
I knew that's what I've been dreaming about all my life: putting it in front of the public in the Olympic games, there wasn't a better feeling," she said.
She also inspired her first selection of songs -Proud, Heather Small- that she felt identified throughout the entire preparation process for Olympic games and still sticks her chicken ass.

Mickelson, not in shape, stayed in the chair on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make the record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his form to avoid looking bad.
Mickelson was breaking the mark by playing it for the 12th time of the year, but Captain Jim Fury sent it to the bench in the 4-ball and 4-somes modalities on Saturday.
Instead of remaining in the center of the action, as has been many times in favor of the United States, the five-time senior champion divided the day to be a cheerleader and to work on the field with the hope of leading him to suffer.
It was never the most direct driver, not even at the best time of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best option for the competitive dynamics of Le Golf National, since the hard players are the ones who are losing.
And even if the field doesn't scare him enough, on Sunday, he will face the British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win the four games of the week.
If the Americans, starting each of the 12 individual games below four points, have a good start, then the game of Mickelson could be a decisive one-off match.
Fury showed his confidence in his man, because he couldn't say much more.
He understood very well the paper he had today, gave me a little pat on the back, and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a brilliant athlete and he's given these teams a great time in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t watch two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we thought we ought to act that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson beats Nick Faldo's record as the player with most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may be the end of a professional career at the Ryder Cup that has not yet reached its individual mark.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and has finished seven times. However, according to Fury, he has brought something inviolable to the team.
She laughs, she's sarcastic and intelligent, and she's always joking with people, and it's great to have their presence," he said.
Young players enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to see him.
He does a lot more than just playing."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that the great advantage they have can disappear immediately
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows with experience that despite the great advantage of the last day’s individual round, the Ryder Cup can easily become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, he made his debut in Valderraman, where under the command of Seven Ballesteros, his team had a five-point lead against the Americans, but they won the tournament tightly with a score of 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
I constantly reminded myself that we had a great advantage in Valderraman and that we had lost the advantage in Brooklyn, although we also had a great advantage,” Bjorn (in the photo), said after winning 5 to 3 classes in 2018 on Friday and yesterday, having had a 10 to 6 advantage on Le Golf National Course.
So history tells me and all my teammates that this is not over yet.
We're going to have a lot of courage tomorrow.
We'll go out on the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are in the clipboard.
We aim to win the trophy, and we will focus on that.
As I have always said, I focus on the 12 players in our side, but we know exactly what’s on the opposite side: the best players in the world.”
Bjorne was happy with the achievements that his players have made on a difficult golf course, and he also said: “I don’t ever want to make any progress.
Tomorrow.
It's the banker's turn tomorrow, and that's something else.
It’s great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you’re alone, each golfer has to prove his full ability.
This is exactly the message you have to convey to the players: the best thing you have to do tomorrow.
Now forget about your associates, because they also have to get their best out of it."
Unlike Bjorn, the other team is convinced that Jim Fury will play better than his individual players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury has also been present on both sides of these recent days as a member of the winning cycling team, and later lost to the European team when Europeans performed the so-called "Miracle of Medina".
I remember all the words he said,” said Ben Crenshawk, captain of 1999, when we asked him how he encouraged the players in the last day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the start, just like in Brooklyn and Medina.
If the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We have decided on this list of players, and we believe that we will do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas is working to counter the attack, with Rory McIlroy in the final match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poole being the other mid-order Europeans.
I chose that group in that order because they are able to complete the entire route,” Bjorn said on the selected individual.
New German Navy building has been delayed again
The new German navy fragment was required in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not be built until the following year due to defective systems and higher costs, according to local media.
The demand for the ship called "Rheinland-Pfalz" (Baden-Wuerttemberg class new frigate ship) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, who has mentioned a military spokesman.
It was necessary to enter the marina in 2014, but after delivery, eleven problems have prevented this ambitious project from being carried out.
Four of the Baden-Wuerttemberg classes commissioned by Marina in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It appears that it will have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a technology of hidden actions (such as reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
In addition, it will have a longer maintenance capacity: the most recent frigates may be up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, due to constant delays, the latest technology-driven warships (which aim to project Germany's capacity) will be obsolete by the time they enter the service, says the newspaper Die Zeit.
The F125 fragmentation that made a lot of noise last year in the media, as the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to Hamburg's Bohm & Voss shipyard.
It was the first time the marina ship had returned to the ship after delivery.
The reasons for the return are unknown, but the German media cited serious "software and hardware failures" which would make it impossible for the warships to be used in combat missions.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg class boats are operated by 120 sailors, half of which are included in the Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the packaging weighs too much and as a result, its performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult for the marina to add novelties in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship weighs twice the size of the ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project (including crew training) is also the problem.
It has reached €3,100 million, from €2,200 that should be initially costing.
The problems with the new frigates are even more important when it comes to warnings that the German marina capacity is being reduced.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the “utility ships” of the marina are exhausting.
The representative said that the problem has grown more and more because the old ship has not given a replacement.
He regretted not having even joined a frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class.
A secret bat's life is observed by the National Trust
A new study has been carried out on a land in the Scottish countryside to determine how bats use a food search landscape.
They are expected to obtain more information about the behaviour of these special flying mammals in order to better determine their protection activities in the future.
The research carried out by scientists from the National Trust (NTS) in Scotland will monitor common and soprano dwarf mice, as well as large-earned Daubenton bats in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special engravers will be placed in key locations, where monitoring of the activities of the bats throughout the season will be carried out.
Employees of the UK health system (NHS) will also perform mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts perform a sound analysis of all the recorders, the frequency of the bat calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then, a map of the habitat and a report will be made to obtain a detailed landscape scale image of the behavior of the bat.
According to Rob Deware, a NTS natural protection consultant, it will determine which areas of the bat's habitat are the most important, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will enable us to determine the advantages of the treatment of habitat, such as the generation of meadows, and the best maintenance of forests for bats and related species.
The bat population of Scotland and the United Kingdom declined dramatically in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and developmental work, which affects nests and leads to the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a risk, including fly capture papers, construction materials chemical treatments, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, as they usually hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the moment of prey.
They use a sophisticated echo positioning technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight route.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of Scotland, and occupies bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly make observations, examinations of nests, and sometimes rescues.
In fact, the organisation has created a first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Durfries and Galloway Land of Threve, where eight of the ten species of bat live.
According to David Thompson, the manager of the plot, the land is the perfect land for them.
We have an excellent area for the Treven Bat," he said.
We have old buildings and trees for many years; the habitat is very good.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so we understand what they need to be healthy thanks to our work here and in other lands."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check if there is a single bat before doing basic maintenance, since if the single maternity nest is destroyed accidentally, 400 bats and offspring may be killed, and this may result in the disappearance of the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, persecute or disturb them, as well as to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representing the Bat Protection Agency, asked for help from the general population.
He said: “We still have to learn a lot about bats, and we don’t know how many of the species that live with us.”
Ronaldo rejects accusations of rape while his lawyers hurry to report to the German magazine
The accusations of rape against him are "false news" Cristiano Ronaldo said that those who made it want only "advertising" by his name.
His lawyer is preparing to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the report.
A striker from Portugal and Juventus accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then reportedly paid $375,000 in return for the secret incident, Der Spiegel noted Friday.
A few hours after the indictment is released, he made a live Instagram video for 142 million followers on the 33-year-old Ronaldo’s platform, where he said the accusations are “false news”.
No, no, no, no.
The news today is fake news,” said the footballer who won the gold ball five times in front of the camera.
They want to get publicity by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get fame by my name, but that usually happens in my profession.
I am a happy man, and everything is all right," said the gambler, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel for allegations that they are “absorbed about his suspicions about privacy”.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation “as far as the severity of the violation is concerned, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged event took place in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga decided to go to the player’s room where he was raped from the anus, according to Nevada’s Clark County district court’s documents.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo would fall on his knees after the supposed event, and say that he was “a good man in 99 percent”, but that he missed “one percent”.
The documents indicate that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but the relationship was authorized.
Mayorga also said she had gone to the police and had taken photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later came to an out of court deal because she "was afraid of reprisals and was concerned that she was publicly humiliated."
34-year-old woman says she wants to back down the deal because she is still traumatized by the supposed event.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he moved to the large Italian Juve team due to an agreement of €100 million.
Brexit: The UK will regret losing its self-producers
The UK will regret “forever” the leader of self-manage manufacturers after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He has also said that it is "disheartening" that the UK will stop production of the UK factory in Burnaston, near Derby if it has not reached a UK deal.
We need a deal," Clarke said.
Japanese auto manufacturer has said that delays in customs due to a “Brexit” without an agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
We believe that if the UK leaves without an agreement at the end of March, the production of our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other British auto manufacturers (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also claim that they are not afraid to know how border trading will work if they withdraw without a European agreement.
BMW, for example, said it will close its Mini factory after Brexit for a month.
The main concern of self-producers is the risks to the supply chain, if the ‘Brexit’ is to be carried out without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is “current” and the pieces reach every 37 minutes, both UK and EU suppliers, for cars created as required.
If the United Kingdom exits without an agreement on 29 March of the European Union, interruptions may occur at the border and consequently delays and lack of parts.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day in a factory in Derbyshire, so production would have to be stopped.
According to Clark, the “Chequers” plan for the future of EU contact is “specifically measured to avoid these customs studies.”
We want the best deal to ensure not only the current success but also the future use of this option,” said BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have proven that it is essential to continue with the very successful supply chains.
Toyota has not been able to determine how long production will be halted, but in the long run, due to additional costs it would be possible to reduce factory competitiveness and, as a result, it warned that jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallarias, who has been working for Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the Unit union’s factory, said that there are more and more concerned members: “I say with experience that if we lose these jobs, we will not recover them.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a concrete and credible plan of future contact with the European Union.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed, according to the White House.
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein in the general prosecutors could be “delayed another week,” while the conflict regarding the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh goes on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, an influence on Russia's election, the link between Trump's assistants and Russia, and is investigating the alleged obstruction of justice that the president had.
Trump's dismissal of the general prosecutor and the consequent threat to Mueller's independence has been discussed in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein had contemplated taking a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from office in accordance with Article 25 of the US constitution.
Rosenstein has canceled the information.
However, he moved to the White House on Monday, as information was released that he would resign.
Instead, he announced that he would have a meeting with Trump at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Thursday.
Trump has said he prefers not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting has been delayed to prevent conflict with the Senate's judicial power committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual assaulting him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week of research to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has led to a further delay in the Senate's vote.
Trump's secretary of press, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said, "It's not yet a date set; it may be this week, but I'd understand that it would be a week later, taking into account everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists will disagree with this statement: Sanders has not given a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked the reason for this.
Sanders says the lack of press has not been that the television reporters are "surprised", but he said, "I agree they're arrogant."
Then he suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
The president is doing much more questions than his predecessors,” he added without mentioning the evidence: “We have checked these statistics.”
Sanders says the press will continue to do press conferences, but "if the press can ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than asking me.
We often try to do this, and you have seen that we have done so many times in the past few weeks, and that will replace the press, when we allow the possibility of talking to the President of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House, takes part in open sessions, or in newspapers that are held when he/she visits the dignitaries.
He doesn't usually do his own press.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the President of the United States in New York this week, when he made a spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the journalists he gathered.
The United Kingdom’s health department secretary writes a letter to the workers of the European Union working in the NHS in Scotland for concerns about the “Brexit”
The Health Department has written to workers working in the NHS health system in Scotland to thank the whole country and ask them to stay there after Brexit.
The letter was written by the Scottish Parliament, Jean Freeman, who left less than six months to leave the European Union.
The Scottish government has already agreed to assume the cost of applying for “population status” of citizens of the European Union working in public services.
Freeman said in his letter: "Through the summer, negotiations on "Brexit" have progressed between the UK and the European Union, and a decision is expected to be made in autumn.
However, the UK government has increased preparations for possible untreated output.
I know it's a very disturbing time for you all.
That's why I want to confirm that I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
European Union partners, as well as those from outside, contribute valuable experiences and skills, and improve the work of the health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without a doubt, and we hope to live with you."
Emergency operation on the head of Christ Abercrombie after suffering an injury
The backer of the Christion Abercrombie Tennessee State Tigers has been operated in emergency operation after suffering a wound on the head on Saturday 31 and 27, against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ has reported.
According to Rod Reed Tennessee State coach, the player has suffered a brain injury shortly before the mid-game break.
He's got the band on his side and he's unconscious," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel have provided oxygen to Abercrombie in the same band, and have been taken to a litter for a deeper medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that he was out of operation and is in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that “they have not yet given details about the type of wound or its severity”, and they are trying to determine when the wound happened to the Tennessee State group.
He is in his second year with the red-shirt Abercrombie and has his first season with the Tennessee State team after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five batches before leaving the match on Saturday, making a total of 18 batches throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the timbre when buying fertilizers in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher timbre tax in the UK when buying fertilizers, and that amount will be used to help those who are left homeless, in accordance with the conservative party's plans.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
Taxes in the United Kingdom will not be taxed for tax increases in the area of the timbre
The Treasury believes that it will raise £120 million a year to help homeless people
The foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the timbre when buying fertilizers in the UK, and the amount of extra to help those who are left homeless, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters; Corbyn has promised to provide affordable housing prices and pay more taxes for the majority of the income.
In the UK, tax increases will be made for people and companies who do not pay taxes, and the amount collected will be used for the government’s efforts to reduce sleeping people on the street.
Overload, which is an additional tax on the current timbre (including higher taxes for the second houses entered two years ago and for the benefit acquired for the lease), can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that it will raise $120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the people who do not live in the United Kingdom built in London are buying it, so prices go up and it is more difficult for those who want to buy it to enter the home market for the first time.
The rich areas of the country, especially of the capital, have become " ghost towns", since foreign buyers tend to spend most of their time outside the country.
To help young people buy their first home after Boris Johnson made a request to reduce the tax on the timbre, this new policy.
Without buying and using land, the prices of the estates have been high attributed to large construction companies, and May has asked them to abandon the affordable housing share in order to solve the “housing crisis” in Britain.”
Corbyn, on the other hand, has presented some of the attractive reforms in the area of housing, such as the control of rents and the ‘unreasonable’ housingisation.
In addition, the city wants to provide more capacity to build more housing.
May said, "I said last year I was going to dedicate my British dream to regenerating the life of every new generation.
This means repairing the corrupt housing market.
British doors will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their lives.
However, it is not fair to be as easy for people who do not live in the UK as for British citizens who work hard for foreign companies to buy homes.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has been far too far away, and the dignity of those who sleep in the street is still here."
Jack Ross: “To be the head coach of the Scottish team is my greatest wish”
The head of Jack Ross Sunderland says that his ‘greatest desire’ is to be the head coach of the Scottish team one day.
He is enjoying the challenge of reviving the 42-year-old Scottish club in the north-east, which is in third place in the League One, three points from first place.
He came this summer to the Stadium of Light, after returning St. Mir's team to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I won a trophy of the B League, and that was all,” Ross said in the BBC Scotland Sport Sound program.
But when I was a kid, I saw matches in Scotland at Hampton with my father, and I've always wanted to come back.
However, I would only have the opportunity if I had the ability to hold the club."
Among those coached in Sunderland before Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Athletic’s ex-manager Alloa said that he did not feel nervous to come after such great names, as he had previously declined to offer training for Barnsley and Ipwich Town.
To measure my success, I’ll have to ask myself, “Can I go back to the Premier League?”
Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should definitely be in Premier League,” he said.
It won’t be easy to get there, but I won’t see myself as successful if I can’t do that.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, as a contributor to Dumbarten's boss for a period and one of the Hearts training staff for 15 months.
He then helped Alla to recover after going down to the third level and, thanks to him, he also became champion of St. Mir's rank in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academics.
It was a real crossroads for me, maybe,” he said about taking care of Allo.
I really thought that being a coach was the best job for me, rather than being a player.
It's funny to say that, because I was a good player, I made a good living, and I lived some important moments of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
I still have the stress and the pressure of the work, but I like it as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever."
The entire interview will take place on September 30 at the Radio Scotland Sport Sound show between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
Five-thirty on Saturday is the best time to have a drink, according to a survey.
Thanks to the summer heat wave, a lot of British pub revenues have increased, but the pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
Pub and bar chains sales have risen by 2.7 percent, but restaurants have fallen by 4.8 percent, according to data.
Peter Martin, who has collected data in business consultancy, states: "Since the Sun has consistently struck, and the British team has more than believed in the World Cup of Football, July data is similar to June where the income of the pubs has risen by 2.8 percent, while restaurants have fallen further.
Even though sales of restaurants fell by 1.8, they were even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that specialize in drinks have far improved performance, and their rise has been higher than the drop in sales for restaurants.
The pubs that specialize in food have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
People just want a drink.
Pub and bar drink sales have increased by 6.6 percent in the past month, while food sales have dropped by 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: “These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of social events and sports are the most important factors in terms of sales from home.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains have economic hardships, and that the decline of 4.8 percent of sales from one year to another will result in significant damage, in addition to continuing pressures on the cost.
Long and hot summer comes in the wrong time for establishments specializing in food, and it is to be seen whether moderate temperatures in August will provide them with comfort."
The increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened establishments, has been 2.7 percent in July, with the slowing of the expansion of the chains.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Index supervises sector sales in terms of pubs, bars, and restaurants in the UK, collecting and analysing data on performance of 47 operator groups, which together have revenues of over £9,000 million, which is considered sector reference points.
One in five children have access to social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) hide accounts from parents and teachers in social networks, according to a survey
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, it has been seen that “false Instagram accounts” have risen.
As a result of this news, the fear that sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “major” account that their parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11) have social media accounts that they hide from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 high school students, many “false Instagram accounts” have been seen ( Instagram is a photo-sharing website).
As a result of this news, the fear that sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main’ account that their parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, in which a teenager called her “mighty” to others.
This research by the UK’s Digital Awareness UK and the “Directorate Conference” (HMC) of independent schools has two-percented profiles of children aged 11 to 18 years, from which half admit they have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, the head of the HMC, said, "It is troubling that adolescents are tempted to create secret online spaces that cannot be found by parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "athlete" member of the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as the Executive Director of the Athletics Committee in the General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most awarded Scottish athlete, and Ian Beattie has said that with this change they have a great opportunity to benefit from his extensive international experience in the last decade.
Eilidh has great respect for the Scottish, UK and worldwide athletic community, and we know that it will be very useful for the Scottish athletics to be on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be an athlete spokesman, and I hope I'll make a great contribution and focus on sport in Scotland."
The U.S. won the 200 and 400 metres races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and has four total gold medals. He is currently a BBC broadcaster. He recently lost his ability to walk due to a past Ischemic infarction.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was to see if I was going to restore it or not, or to what extent.
It's been very hard, but I've been totally restored, and I've had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing skills today!

A milk extract ad comparing mothers to cows has created contrary opinions on the Internet
A milk extraction company has created contrasting opinions on the Internet compared to breast donors with milked cows.
In order to present what is said to be “the world’s first silent milk extraction carrier”, Elvie, a consumer technology company, has released a joke in a music video to show the freedom of new devices to mothers who extract milk.
They dance in a stable of four really mothers of straw, with these words and a song like: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have to stick to it," and "Perhaps you haven't noticed, but these are not ravens, but my breasts."
The motto is, “Get the milk out, get the milk out, give it to the children, take the milk out, I’m milking my girls.”
However, this advertisement on the company’s Facebook page has created a discussion on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a wide range of reactions to viewers. Many have said it does not take “the horror” of the milk industry seriously.
It was a very bad decision to use the cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they also need to become pregnant and give birth to milk, but their offspring are stolen within a few days of their birth,” a user said.

Someone else said, “It’s very traumatic, of course, for mom and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a milk extract for mothers who don’t take their children away from them?”
Someone else added, “This advertisement has no kindness.”
But others have defended the announcement. A woman has said she thought it "like a laugh."
I think it's a great idea.
If I still had my chest, I'd buy one.
When I got the milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but that's the goal.
It’s a great product,” a user wrote.
Another comment reads: “It’s a fun advertisement, focused on mothers who extract milk (often have to do it in their workplaces or in the toilets) because they feel like they are “cows”.
He has no intention of praising or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have been dancing with milk extract in their chests.
Many of the women who drink milk feel like cows.
Elvie milk extract is completely silent, and has no cables or tubes. It can be carried discreetly in one of the breast feeding breasts so that the women can move as they please, the babies can be held in their arms or gone out.
Ana Balarin, a partner in Mother’s and CEO, commented: “Elvie milk extract is a very revolutionary product, so she called for a bold and provocative presentation.
With this parity between women and dairy cows that extract milk, we wanted to highlight the process of extracting milk and all its challenges, and also to express the freedom of milk production in an entertaining and close way.
This is not the first time Elvie milk extract has attracted attention.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared in the corridor for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of child emigrants are taken to a camp campground on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detected has increased significantly recently, although there has been roughly the same daily surveillance on the border; one of these is due to the fact that Trump’s leadership and rhetoric have been more difficult to transport children to sponsors.
Up to now, undocumented migrants have been the majority of their protectors, but now they are afraid to register to protect their children, as they might lose their ability to stay in the US.
The risk increased in June, as federal authorities said that those who wanted to be a sponsor and the other adults living in their home should send fingerprints, and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, one of the U.S. immigration officers and customs security officer Matthew Albence confessed to the arrest of dozens of people who asked for protection for minors who arrived without an adult.
This agency later confirmed that 70 percent of them had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or those who live with them are illegally in our country, and many of them are criminals.
So we're continuing to reach them," Albenc said.
In order to speed up the situation of the child, the officers have created new rules that should appear in court within a month after the capture of the children, not as before, according to the shelter staff.
Many of them will appear in a videoconferencing call, requesting legal status from a immigration judge.
If it is decided that it is not appropriate to receive help, they will be deported immediately.
The more time the child spends in care centres, the more opportunities to increase their anxiety and depression, resulting in violent anger or attempted escape, according to the shelter staff and reports in the system over the past few months.
The defenders of the children say that these concerns increase in large facilities such as Tornillo, because there is so much more probability of ignoring children's problems.
They also said that if children are taken to the campground emotionally without time to prepare or say goodbye to their friends, the trauma they already have may increase.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupants” to withdraw immediately
The United Nations General Assembly also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
The former prime minister, Moalem, has also said that foreign forces are illegal in Syria territory, under pretence of fighting terrorism, and will be "treated as they are".
They must be removed immediately and unconditionally from the territory,” he said in the board.
Moualek has said that the war on terrorism in Syria has almost ended; 360,000 people have been killed in this war since 2011, and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to “fight in the holy battle” until we clear all Syria’s territories from terrorist groups and from “illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has 2,000 men in Syria, mostly trained and mentored Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the land of the country that destroyed the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem has said that there are adequate conditions to return them, and has accused some “Western countries” of spreading the “irration fear” that urges refugees to stay away.
We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns,” he said.
They are politicizing just what is humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to Syria to support Assad and the opposition to end the war until they reach a political agreement.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have recently reached an agreement to create a protective camp in the last stronghold of the rebels in Idlib; the United Nations believes that it is possible to promote political dialogue thanks to it.
The Russian-supported Syrian forces were able to prevent a large-scale attack between Russia and Turkey on the territory of three million people.
However, Moualem has stated that the agreement has clear "limits" and that military action will be aimed at jihadists, such as the Nusra front-line fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who will be "dismembered".
The United Nations Commissioner for Migration, Staffan de Mistur, hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will be held between the members of the government and the opposition to start forming a post-war constitution, as well as opening up the way to the election.
Moualem has established a series of conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this meeting, stating that the work of the assembly must be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warning that no one else should interfere.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Time
Following this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 if (as many Democratic Party viewers probably expected) an annulment process or scandal does not end his presidency prematurely.
That would be “the most dramatic end to a presidency!”
At the moment, it doesn’t look like the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the majority of the audience has almost doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and tripled the MSNBC network to 1.6 million.
Fox News, on the other hand, has attracted 2.4 million viewers on this schedule, which has risen 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen's data. The MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the largest cable television viewer, and has reached 3.5 million viewers on the night of the news that took place.
It's like a fire that attracts people, because we want to understand what's going on," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC "Designed survivor". After the assassination of the Capitol, Baer's session is about a cabinet president.
Just the Funny Parts: And A Few Things About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" is a highly experienced comedy-writer, and the author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And A Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club" has another theory.
Before the 2016 election, he was in a taxi in Boston,
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked him why.
He said, “It made him laugh.”
There is also time for entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, like nothing else on television, stories from Washington come to the future of the abortion law, immigrants can reunite, and they decide for the health of the global economy.
Only high-privileged viewers have the option to disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you give a six-hour discussion on various topics: how Bob Woodward has used “deep precedents” to write the book, Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar ostrich jacket (“full of debris”), and Stormy Daniels describes Trump’s “anatomism.”
At least I won't look at Super Mario in the same way again.
The executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of the “Pawn Stars” programme, Brent Montgomery, commented on Trump’s changing characters and arguments (discussion with the national football league, Kim Jong-un’s praise): “It gives you the feeling of being a reality show because it gives something to experience every day.”
You can't lose any parts, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleis this week, he was 26 degrees tall and sunny at his house on the north coast of Kaua, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not get off television, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh has to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that the future of the Supreme Court is hanging.
When I was doing these strange television series, people used to say that it was the end of Western civilization,” Fleis told me.
I thought it was a kind of joke, but they were probably right.

Foreign money is entering the bar at the most equal elections in the middle of the US Congress
It is not surprising that the money is being deposited in the 17th District of Pennsylvania, since the congress districts have been reorganised and are therefore competing for the same chair with two holders.
In that district around Pittsburgh, border reorganizations have represented the Democratic Party's Conor Lamb, who got his seat in special elections from another district.
Lamb has another rival, Keith Rothfus of the Republican Party, who represents the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the District Borders were being manipulated against what the Constitution says in favor of the Republicans, which led to the verdict that map boundaries were correctly delineated.
This new competition of 17th District has led to a close campaign funding competition among the main funding sources of the parties: the Congress Committee for Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name for having won the 18th congress district special elections in Pennsylvania in March.
It was a Republican's seat in the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
According to political commentators, Democrats have a bit of an advantage.
The US condemns El Salvador to support China, but then rejects the decision
Diplomats have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged that Beijing, Washington has hardly asked them to withdraw.
Trump had a polite meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama, until his partners decided to throw out the Trump administration team.
The officers of the department of state decided to remove the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following "new decisions to leave Taiwan", the department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a month's initial statement.
However, it was considered only to make the sanctions against El Salvador, which received $40 million as a support from the United States in 2017, including controlling traffic, promoting development and supporting the economy.
The proposed sanctions include economic aid restrictions and specific visa restrictions which would be very detrimental to the Central American country due to its high rates of unemployment and murder.
As the internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, aiming to succeed a similar meeting in the previous year, and it was considered to try to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior government officials made it clear that they wanted to attend the conference, thus stating that the consideration of imposing sanctions on El Salvador had been abandoned.
Mike Pence is expected to take part in the conference that has changed in mid-October, a sign of the importance of the administrative meeting, according to the diplomats.
The three U.S. officials have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a message or harsh punishment in Washington.
A spokesman for the White House in Bolton has refused to make any statements about the details given by the three American officers, which included two diplomats who agreed to report the internal discussions in return for maintaining anonymity.
An analyst who has a close relationship with the administration and also spoke anonymously confirms what they said.
Learn History
Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report will soon be released, which will indicate whether Trump had objected to justice, as there is much evidence in the public opinion.
In addition, Mueller is also investigating whether the Russian attack on the U.S. election had helped Trump's campaign.
If the majority of Congress changes sides, Trump will have to give them instructions as he prepares to appear again in front of the voters (and, perhaps, a jury of his own) and possibly in front of them.
There are many conditions for this, however, and I don’t mean that Trump’s decline is inevitable, or Trump’s European equivalent.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic and determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to hold a coup d'état against Hitler if Western countries had supported him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to escape the massacre of the following years.
We have a history of such turning points that accelerates or delays the inevitable progress of democracy.
Americans are facing so many turning points at the moment.
What do we do if Trump launches Rod Rosenstein, the general prosecutor, who controls what will happen to Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been in jeopardy since the news of last year that he had suggested a secret recording of the president, and that the president had declared himself unfit for his position.
Rosenstein says that the Times is not correct.
How will we respond if the FBI has just been asked about Brett Kavanaugh for a full or fair investigation, or if he receives confirmation of being a Supreme Court judge, even if there have been credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony against him?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of the legislature in such a way as to set up a Congress that asks Trump for accountability?
If we do not pass these tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.
However, I really think we will overcome them based on my teaching in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew, and the Nazi regime that occupied my embassy was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she asked me to light a Sabbat candle on a table she had drawn on a svastica.
With this inheritance, how can I not look forward to the future?"

The Graham Dorrans of Rangers feels optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The host of Rapid Vienna will be Rangers on Thursday. They know that if the Austrians defeat them, after an exciting draw with the Spanish Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will be placed in the perfect position to qualify for the G team of the Europa League.
Because of a knee injury the midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to make his first appearance in the season up to a draw of 2 and 2 with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use it as a tramp for better things.
It was a good result, for Villarreal is a good rival,” said the 31-year-old player.
We decided to do something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have a chance to win at the end, but the result is a draw, maybe.
In the first half, they dominated, and in the second, we were the bosses.
Thursday night will be very important for the European Championship.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult, because they had a good result in the final match, but the audience is on our side, and I think we're going to get a positive result.
Last year was hard, I had injuries and there was a change in the club itself, but there is a positive atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it a lot; training is good too.
I believe that we will move forward, forgetting about the previous season and making it a success.”
Women are extremely concerned about a savings problem for their retirement
The participants of the survey knew what care they want to have, but very few reported it to their family members.
Half of those involved in the study of Nationalwide have said they talked to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent have spoken about it with their children.
We want a family member to wait for us, but we don’t dare to ask,” explains Holly Snyder, President of the Nationalwide Insurance Company.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be willing to take care of you unless you ask them to do so first.
Collaborate with an advisor and the family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, because these options will depend on the cost of care.
Ask for help from an advisor: an advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term care: long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay the costs of care in cash, and at the moment, who can pay for it if you have that money.
Clear legal documents: Forget legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health, and ensure that you are as careful as you wish if you are unable to order it.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a reliable person on your behalf to make financial options and, when you are unable to do so, make sure that you pay the bills.
Do not forget that the parents are elderly and that one of them has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about allergies or allergies?

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died on Friday as a result of the heavy earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu, and the number of killed is estimated to increase.
Cut down communication systems, the relief agents were unable to obtain information from the Donggal government, which is the area closest to the 7.5 magnitude earthquake epicenter in northern Palau.
Palun, over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are the important information about the city of Paul and the government of Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Pulu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow coastal bay on the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a government covering more than 300 km (180 mi) of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is the administrative region of the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the Central Sulawesi province is based on fisheries and agriculture, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowalin, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster management table (In Indonesia National Board for Disaster Management), Palu and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed in the Donggalan tsunami.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred in the west of Donggal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the so-called “Pacific fire belt” seismic area, which is why it is frequently exposed to earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake occurred on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, causing a tsunami that shook 14 countries, causing 226,000 deaths across the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several powerful earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near the Sumatran coast.
2006: An earthquake of 6.9 magnitude occurred in southern Java (the most populated island in Indonesia), causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast severely and nearly 700 dead.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, South Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred on one of the islands near Sumtra, causing a tsunami of 10 meters, resulting in the destruction of dozens of small villages and the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake occurred in the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, which brought disaster and fear, as people remembered the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There were no tsunamis at the time, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings.
2018: A number of major earthquakes occured among tourists on the island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, especially in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many of the tourists were temporarily unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested with domestic violence charges
The eldest son of Sarah Palin, former Governor of Alaska, Track Palin, is arrested with attack charges.
Born in Palin, 29 years old and suspected of domestic violence, he was arrested for indicting a domestic violence case and opposition to authority, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troops division.
According to police report, when a prominent woman started calling the police to report the alleged crime, Palin removed the phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is located at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, in a preemptive prison and under a bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday and said that he was "no doubt innocent," as the network announced.
Palin has been charged with three minor A crimes and could receive a maximum prison sentence of one year and a fine of €250,000.
He is also charged with a minor crime of level B, which could be punishable by a one-day prison sentence and fined $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, Todd Palin was accused of assaulting his father.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic assaults, indicting a domestic violence crime, and having a gun in her possession.
The girl's friend said she had a stroke.
When his son's aggressive attitude was associated with the post-traumatic stress imbalance caused by the Iraqi experience, Sarah Palin received harsh criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed on Friday after an earthquake hit Sulawesi Island in Indonesia.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitude created a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electrical and communications networks are suspended, and in the coming days the number of deaths is expected to increase.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, which is located in the north-east of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that show the moment of impact on social networks.
In fact, on the occasion of a beach festival in the city of Palu, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants a special death sentence for New York City's suspected terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for eight people who died in New York City for suspicion of terrorist attack Sayfullo Saipov; the last time such a federal crime was imposed in the state was in 1953.
It is believed that 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental truck for the attack on the West Side Highway road in South Manhattan, before carrying all pedestrians and bicycles.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov had intentionally killed these eight people and seriously wounded several “intentionally” people, according to the intentional warning of the death penalty presented in the District of New York.
According to legal documents, in both cases the death penalty may be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal court sentenced Saipov, among others, eight assassination charges for organized crime, which the federal prosecution usually uses in the case of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction by motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor, the attack had to be “pre-planned and planned” as Saipov did “cruelity” as he described it.
The actions of Sayfullo Habibullaecvic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, as stated in the statement.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York was the last to prosecute a death sentence.
The murder of two drug dealers, Khalid Barnes, was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were then subjected to conspiracy to espionage the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbek Saipov did not show any remorse for days and months after the attack.
Police said it didn't feel bad about what they did.
According to reports, Saipov told authorities that he had seen videos of ISIS on mobile inspiration for the attack.
He also asked the police to flag the ISIS in the hospital room.
In the case of a crime of 22, he has declared himself innocent.
David Patton, one of the Federal Public Defenders who is responsible for the replacement of Saipov, said they have taken “a great deal of deception” with the decision of the prosecution.
We believe that instead of accepting a declaration of inviolable life imprisonment, the decision to sue for death will only prolong the impact of these events,” said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had asked the prosecutor not to seek death sentences before.
A Member of the Conservative Party says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has ordered “the mobilisation of the people’s army” in the protest of the conservative party today.
The former leader of the UKIP has said that policymakers need to “feel the heat” of the Eurosceptics, and Theresa May MEPs have proposed to deal with EU negotiations.
Conservative Peter Bone explained to the marchers of Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "outside" if Mr. Farage was already Brexit secretary.
But the conservatives in favour of the stay have organised a protest against Brexit in the city, highlighting the challenge of Lady May’s total reconciliation.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to keep up with the plan of commitment, but he is suffering from attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of stay and EU.
The Allies believe that they will move forward and try to reach an agreement with Brussels excluding such reactions, and that the Eurosceptics and labourers will be forced to decide between their offer and their “caosity”.
As Mr. Bone explained to participants in the demonstration of Leave Leave Leave Means held in Soilhu, he wanted to “release Chequers”.
He also stated that he had to cooperate with Mr. Farage and that he should be entrusted with negotiations with Brussels.
If he was responsible, we would already be outside,” he said.
The Parliament of Wellington County added: “I will defend Brexit, but we need to fire Chequers.”
In a statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight the world in order to serve anyone.
We want to make our laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone rejected that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The British have changed their minds and want to stop them from lying.”
She was also a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who explained to the correspondents: "I'm just saying, Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the public.
Chequers is not known among the citizens, the opposition will not vote for him, it will not be known among our party, nor among our activists who shake the streets and make elections possible.
Stop Chequers and start listening.
Speaking to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers must keep their work to themselves.
Mr. Farage told the members of the demonstration that “the feeling of heat” must be forced to betray their decision in the 2016 referendum.
Now this is a matter of trust between our (people) and our political class,” he said.
They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to let them know that we won’t let them go with it.
Addressing a crowd full of enthusiasm, he added: “I want you to feel the heat for our political class that is going to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the military of the people who gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud of it.
In the meantime, the remaining parties travelled through Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration in the center of the city.
A few activists lifted posters against Brexit after group lunch this weekend.
Mr. Adonis, a member of the farm, laughed at the conservatives at their initial security issues with the party.
These are people who tell us that ICT systems can work properly, and that the entire technology of the Canada plus chain, the limitless, free trade, is added in Ireland.
It's a terrible lie.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren will consider the possibility of becoming president with great attention.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider the possibility of being president with great care after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat of Massachusetts had talked about his future at the plenary meeting that was held in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will again be nominated for election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican Party's state representative; Diehl served as the vice president of Massachusetts's 2016 campaign.
It is said that it is possible to take the place of Trump in 2020.
The event that took place on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th plenary session held by members of the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked him if he was going to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and for this, there must be a woman in charge.
Suspect arrested for shooting caused by the death of Sims from the University of Louisiana
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported that he had arrested a suspect on Friday due to the shooting of basketball player Waye Sims of the University of Louisiana.
The police department of Baton Rouge reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyson Simpson at 11:00 (Eastern Time) news conference.
He had previously opened a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help to identify a man who appeared in it.
Simmons was shot and killed on Friday morning near the university campus.
Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in her head, and as a result, she died at last,” said Chief Justice Murphy J. Paul to Saturday newspaper through 247sports network.
Wayde entered a conflict trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and he admitted he had been there, held a gun in his hand and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken to prison without incident at the Baton Rouge Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
He grew up in the Sims Baton Rouge, playing 32 10-star games in his last season, and averaged 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game in 17.4 minutes.
Grand Prix race in Russia: Lewis Hamilton earned the world title thanks to the squad's orders after winning Sebastian Vettel
It became clear that since the qualifying Saturday before Valtteri Bottas Lewis Hamilton, orders from the Mercedes team would be killed or alive in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas did great work, and almost threw him out to defend his place in the first two times, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes, and Hamilton had to get into the traffic at the end of the peloton, which should have had a direct impact on the race.
Mercedes came into the boxes a few days later and followed Vettel, but after a match Hamilton stepped forward, leaving the Ferrari driver free to hold his position after a double move to defend the third corner.
The 21-year-old Max Verstappen started the race in the final row of the exit grill and finished in seventh place.
He remained in first place in much of the race, and by the end kept the tires to finish the race quickly and to advance to Kim Raikkon and get the fourth place.
Eventually, he entered the box on the 44th round, but was unable to live on eight of his remaining rounds, and Riakkonen finished fourth.
It’s not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job all weekend and has been really honest.
The team did a great job in the match,” Hamilton said.
Those were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein during a demonstration held on Saturday in which Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assaults on Supreme Court for highlighting the fact that he had not leaked the letter to Christine Blasey Ford himself.
Speaking at a rally held in West Virginia, the president did not make a direct reference to Ford's testimony to the Senate Committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, false, and false".
The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that is going on in the last few days in the Senate, that you see the anger, that you see the angry people, that you see the evil people, that they are false and false.
You see publications and leaks and say, “Oh, it’s not me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, have you leaked your letter?
Do you remember his answer? Have you leaked the letter?
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked it.”
Wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked it," he added, mimicking the reaction of the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter explaining the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked last September, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred in her office.
I haven’t hidden any complaint from Dr. Ford; I haven’t leaked his story,” said Feinstein to the Commission, as The Hill reports.
He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as he asked.
But the refusal of him was not welcomed by the president, who declared on Saturday night during the demonstration: "I'll tell you, they were unsuitable gestures.
It may not have been him, but they were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen."
Following the defense of the Supreme Court, the three women accused of inappropriate sexual position, the president stated that Democrats are using their claims for their own purposes.
They are ready to do anything to restore power.
They are evil, no matter who they hurt, who they have to oppress to get the power and control,” said the president, as the Mediate site said.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars recaptured the Sunday match against Belfast Giants, who won 5-3 in Dundee.
He started winning the Giants with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauviler.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the draw, but the leadership was quickly revived by Giants.
François Bouchard brought the draw back to Dundee, and the two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed the victory.
The third defeat of the elite league in the season was by Adam Keefe, who lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams of the season, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener arrived in the fourth minute, 3:35 minutes, thanks to the help of Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later, David Rutherford helped Beauviler, who doubled the score.
The beginning was intense, as Sullivan brought the draw in 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie and she scored in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants had reached their side in the first break, and at the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the houses were restructured and Bouchard brought the draw back into scoring the goal in 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to support Nielsen and lead Dundee for the first time in the game, and at the end they scored a fifth goal and a team victory.
Players from the Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, will play against Milton Keynes on Friday at home.
An air controller has died so hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers correctly airborne and die.
More than 800 people have died and many more have disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Many powerful replicas have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the rubble of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues had gone to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to resign and left Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the Palau Airport control tower.
Instead, he stayed there to make sure that Air Flight 6321 was properly airborne, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he saw that he was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to Yohannes Sirait, the Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman, the decision made hundreds of lives saved, as the Australian ABC News revealed.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan, to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Peru.
Our hearts break when we hear that,” he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the mortality rate will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesia Bureau of Disaster Management says that access to the Donggal, Sigi, and Boutong villages is limited.
The rate is still expected to grow, as many bodies are still under debris, and we have not been able to reach many others," said the board spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of up to six metres have completely destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing support and supplies.
Her 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma explained to Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance full of bodies arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food from small markets.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explains to CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is working as fast as possible to help those who survived, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Peru on Sunday and explained to the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
This year another earthquake struck Indonesia, which occurred in the city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says that a man is missing after a plane crash in a lake.
The airline operating the flight that fell on a lake in the Pacific in Micronesia states that a man was missing after 47 passengers and crew had successfully evacuated the plane.
Air Niugini said in a publication that until Saturday afternoon he was unable to ensure that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to journalists who asked for more details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to rescue Chuuk after the plane landed in the water.
According to police on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and they were all in a stable situation.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Army said the plane crashed in the lake next to the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
That's a great thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers easily reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane in the water that was reaching their waists.
He said they were scared and they were having trouble, and that he had suffered a small wound in his head.
The U.S. Army said that the assistance of nearby beach-improvement fishermen was also very helpful in the rescue work, by which an inflatable vessel was used to carry passengers to land before sinking the plane in the water at 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network network, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades of aircraft accidents that are recorded in PNG, but none have been caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst makes up the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution delayed the case on Saturday in a trial by a man accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
As he presented it to the jury, he used mobile phone records to connect the 29-year-old convicted Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers with the movements they made the night the woman died.
Rowlett said that she had received location data from various mobile phones that show that she was with Tellis Chambers at the time of her death; thus, she had refuted Tellis' earlier statement, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis's mobile phone was with Chambers' friend Michael Sanford at the time, then the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in front of the judge on Saturday and testified that he was not in the village that day.
When the prosecutor told Tellis that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, "because the truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she met him two weeks ago when Chambers died.
According to the mobile phone registers, they met only a week ago.
Rowlett said after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He wiped it out of his life,” said Hale.
The defenses begin on Sunday with the latest allegations.
The court said that the court will be prosecuted that day.
The High-Breed: What is a Hip-Hop conscious?
A trio of hip-hop music fans want to challenge people with a negative opinion about the kind of music they think about, and to do so, they will deliver their music positively.
The Bristol High Breed says hip-hop music has abandoned its early political messages and social problems.
They want to get back to its roots and get to know the conscious hip-hop again.
Several artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen a revival of such a hip-hop in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New Yorker accuses a couple of crimes against her after a “crazy” message.
A New York babysitter has accused a couple of discriminating and firing for a mistake after receiving a message from his mother that he was not "other black".
The couple denied that they are racist, stating that they are "excessive".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised to find out that the new employee, Giselle Maurice, was black, when he arrived home on his first job in 2016.
Another negro,” said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman noticed the mistake, he felt "absorbed" and fired Miss Maurice, who had been an African-American, who had not been a good worker and was expected to be a Filipino nurse instead.
She paid Miss Maurice one day, and asked for an Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice denounced the couple and asked him to compensate for the damage caused by their dismissal, including $350 for six months a day, and although they had no contract, they initially hired him to live at home for six months and to take care of it.
I want to show them that they don’t do that,” he told the Postman on Friday, and he added, “I know it’s discrimination.
The couple denied that he was a racist, and said that it was necessary and reasonable to dismiss Maurice, because they feared they would not trust him after he had offended him.
My wife sent him something that he didn’t want to tell her.
It's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of a person that you have offended, even if they were a result of a mistake?
Your baby?
No way."
In his statement that the claim was “not that much”, Plasco said that his wife had only been in a couple of months when she was “in a difficult situation”.
Are you looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still in progress, and the public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social networks, punishing them for their attitudes and logic.
The publisher of Paddington was afraid that a bear who speaks to the readers might not like it, as a new letter revealed.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put the book in place of someone who read it for the first time before publication.
It’s very fun to know what we now know about the great success of Paddington.”
His father was a BBC cameraman before he had the inspiration to write a children's book thanks to a small toy bear; his daughter said that his father had a positive attitude to the exclusion of his work and that the 60th anniversary of the book's release had a "sweet-sweet" taste since he died last year.
As far as Paddington is concerned, he is said to have been "one of the most important members of the family", and his father was proud of his success.
He was silent and not arrogant,” he said.
But Paddington was so real to him that he almost felt like a child who achieves something: you feel proud of him, even if it is not your own achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Though he was the creator of her and her imagination, he always acknowledged to Paddington the merit she had given him.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Soon after landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, but doctors were unable to do anything to save her life.
Nad called regularly to say that he was very serious, that he did not think he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad saying that he would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And so I did.
I said, ‘Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors gave him his heart to keep beating, and gradually ran out of his system.
He died a little earlier than I thought, and it was over.
I could only sit down and wait, knowing that everything would begin there.
I could not cry or cry, we were surrounded by family and people.
I had to keep it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been upset with her daughter's death since then, went up to the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting her grief.
No one knew,” he said.
My head was bent, and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Some sad women put posters on a bridge to prevent people from killing themselves
Two more women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide want to prevent themselves from taking life away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed posters on a bridge in Wales, which have positive messages and phone numbers so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lyndney, saying that her son had a special gift for cooking and had a contagious smile.
Everyone knew about the smile.
He always said that his smile was bright.”
However, before he died, he had left work because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother discovered his brother after he had taken his life from himself.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about the domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created a series of posters to let people know that there are people who can tell you what's going on and can help you, even if they're a friend.
Don’t stay silent; you have to talk.
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she was also her partner for 15 years shortly after the death of her mother.
He didn’t even say he was depressed or depressed,” he said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his attitude.
On Christmas day, when the children opened their presents, they didn’t even look at them.
He said that his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to move on: “He leaves a gap in his family.
It's ruining us.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in turmoil after FBI investigation begins
I thought, “If we could get something like what he asked for, such as a limited or limited time research, we could get a little bit of unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid the Commission was “dismembering” in front of the turmoil caused by the enthusiastic parties.
Why didn't the FBI want the case examined by Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters?
The opposite view is due to time.
There are only five weeks remaining for the middle-ranking election: they will be held on November 6, in which the Republicans are expected to get very bad results, and if so, they will start running out of the race that they want the man they want for the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush has made numerous telephone calls to the senators and has put pressure on Mr. Kavanaugh to support him in the White House where Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released their report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting at the moment.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, President Mike Pence could break the draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has “down” since Kim is in power
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean law has said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Reconstruction Department, said there were 1,127 refugees the previous year compared to 2,706 refugees in 2011.
Mr. Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher sanctions on personnel traffickers has been a major factor.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Almost every refugee in North Korea is offered sooner or later to the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone between two Koreas with strong protection measures (DMZ).
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North and South Korea are still at war, but their relations have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the remaining negotiations on denucleization.
Previously, in June, a historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to a Korean non-nuclear peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US of not making any progress.
If we don’t trust the US, we won’t trust our national security, so we won’t leave our weapons first,” said Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly held in New York.
Nancy Pelosi tells Brett Kavanaugh that she's hysterical and that she's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of minority in the House, said she was "heritical" to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, and that she is not ready for the genius to be in the Supreme Court.
In an interview with Pelosi on Saturday, the Texas Tribune Festival was held in Austin, Texas.
I could not help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, they would have said that it was hysterical," said Pelosi, which was Kavanaugh's reaction to the Senate Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied having sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he almost yelled and stammered when he talked about his family and youth.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the Commission, saying that their allegations against Hillary Clinton are “organised and insulting” by angry liberals who lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he can't be in the Supreme Court because he has shown his impartial opinion against democracy.
With these statements and his opposition to the Clintons and Democrats, he’s out of the league,” he said.
Pelosi objected if they chose Kavanaugh and the Democrats reached majority in the House of Representatives when asked if they would challenge him.
I will say: if he does not speak the truth to the Congress or to the FBI, then he is not willing to be in the Supreme Court, nor to be in the court at this time,” said Pelosi.
He is currently the Judge of the Kavanaugh D.C. Circuit Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about the decisions that he will make against the law for access to health care or the Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the ratification court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked whether he would withdraw certain decisions from the Supreme Court.
A impartial and impartial person cannot go to court and hope that we will be well received," said Pelosi.
And women have to be ordered.
It's a fair speech, a dreadful rage of months and years, and he can't let it go without crying.
We cry when we are angry,” said Miss Steinem 45 years later.
I don’t think it’s weird, right?
He continued: “A woman who was an executive from some place helped me tremendously, and told me that she was crying too, but that she had developed a technique when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person who was speaking to her, “You can think that I’m sad, I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought it was a great idea.
Tears are not bad at being seen to express anger, because in part they are misinterpreted.
I remember something that happened to me in one of my earliest jobs, most of them were men in an office where once I was crying with rage, and a more mature woman grabbed me by the neck.
Never let them see you cry,” he said.
They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll feel good because they understand you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a democratic member of the Colorado convention, and worked with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, upon discovering that Mr. Hart had a love affair with another woman who was not his wife, and refused to run, Ms. Schroeder decided to become the same candidate for the presidency.
It wasn’t a good decision,” he said laughing 30 years later.
There were now seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "the Snow White and the Seven Seas."
As the campaign began long ago, he was collecting money that followed him, so he decided not to enter the race until he raised 2 million dollars.
The fight was lost.
He knew that a few followers who had given the men $1,000 had only given him $250.
Do they think I have a discount?” he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not make an official campaign, he was very excited: he supported the public's gratitude, made it difficult for the money and the voters to get together instead of their representatives to get frustrated by the system, and he spoke stammering.
You would have thought I was very nervous," explained Miss Schroeder, regarding the reaction of the press to his position.
You must have thought that Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my grave?
Did he cry?
Trade wars between the US and China benefit Beijing
The salvations that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the US and China were buzzing, and even if the conflict is intense, the gap between countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning at the beginning of the year, then he set up a tax on China's main products, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
The most significant increase has arrived this week, as new rates for products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) will apply to half of goods to be transported to the United States from China.
Beijing has applied reprisals on a regular basis, with the latest rates rising between five and ten percent to the US goods worth $60 billion.
China has said it will match each rise in the US, and the world’s second-largest economy will not change that easily.
Requesting a withdrawal from Washington would lead to a trial, but publicly surrender to the United States would be more embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing succeeds, the pressures for the US trade war could benefit China in the long run, which would reduce the dependency on both economies.
The rapid decision-making of Washington or Beijing politicians would create conditions for economic lagging in two countries, which is more dangerous than the observers had previously believed,” said Abigail Grace, who investigates the New US Security Center with other experts in Asia.
Syria is “prepared” to return refugees, said the Foreign Minister
Syria says it's ready to return to refugees who voluntarily want to return, and it's asking for help to re-establish a country devastated by more than seven years of long war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
Today’s situation is more stable and safer because of the progress made in the process of terrorism,” he said.
The government's restoration of areas destroyed by terrorists continues to ensure that they return to normal as soon as possible.
Now, it is a good situation for refugees who voluntarily wish to return to the country who had to leave due to economic measures that hindered terrorism and their daily life and maintenance.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
As Al-Moualem said, the Syrian regime will greatly appreciate the assistance of the destroyed country.
But he emphasized that he will not accept conditional aid or support from the rebels in the countries that supported him.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup held in Paris
With 16.5 points on the last score, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, held in Le National Outdoor Golf in Paris, France.
The United States has lost six consecutive European soils and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn had scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson went through the entire tournament and hit the exit in the 16th hole in the third half, so that he passed the witness to Francesco Molina.
Many Italian golf players were highlighted in each round, and since the start of the tournament in 1979 he became one of four players ever to have achieved the results of 5, 0 and 0.
Jordan Spieth scored 5 and 4 results and stood outside against the worst player in the European team: Danishman Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the best player in the world, scored 2 and 1 goals against Ian Poole, and reached the final of the Ryder Cup.
Sergio García, who competed in the eight Ryder Cups, became the leading European champion of the tournament, with 22.5 points of race.
I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
It's been a tough year.
So thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have a drink.
This is teamwork, and I am glad that I have been able to help,” said Garcia, excited after the European victory.
John Ram has passed the witness to the Spanish who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods (2 and 1) in an individual Sunday game.
I am very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing that man,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost four games in France, and now holds a record of 13, 21, and 3 results in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, only above Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team spent the whole weekend trying to find a solution to the situation, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, captain of the United States, said, "I'm proud of my boys, they tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work out.
Bejondeiola to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll meet again, we'll cooperate with the US PGA and Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm so proud to be their captain.
We have to accept failure.
We’re outside.”
News about the red tide: The concentration has declined in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the last report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the concentration of red tide in the Tampa Bay area has fallen.
According to the Commission, the conditions for flowering are more irregular in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Colliere, as a result of which the concentration is declining.
In flowering, the red tide extends about 130 miles north of Pinellas County on the south coast of Lee County.
Irregularities are 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but in less places than the week before.
The red tide has also reached the county of Pasco.
In terms of concentrations, they are medium to or near Pinellas County, while low and high are near Hillsborough County, while none and high are near Manatee County, while neither are near Sarasota County, while neither are near nor half Charlotte County, while neither are near Lee County and low Collier County.
The cases of people who experience irritation in their breath continue to rise in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No such case has been registered in North-West Florida in the past few weeks.
