The rapidly increasing cumulative number of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, from January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA and UK countries, which confirms that despite the different stage based on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of COVID-19 patients who will need healthcare, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a set of pneumonia cases were reported for unknown pathogens in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention stated that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e. they have a respiratory infection with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, COVID-19 has worsened to a more severe illness that requires hospitalization while remaining cases of 6% have a serious illness that requires intensive care.
The mortality rate for patients who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 was around 4%.
In this study, we assess and compare the cumulative number of COVID-19 trends in each EU/EEA country and the UK (UK) with those from Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has spread geographically and is currently tracking the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the number of Eurosorfellins issued on March 5, 2020, Spittery and others reported the first confirmed European COVID-19 cases according to the WHO definition of the case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all EU/EEA 30 countries and the UK (UK), as between December 31, 2019 to this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative rate of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to evaluate and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK in Italy.
As a measure of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent COVID-19 cases within 14 days, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA and UK countries, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of cases reported from each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 am, compared to the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases withholding within a 14-day period in the EU/EEA and UK countries followed those of Hubei Province (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to grow around February 21, and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020 (complementary material).
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed trends of an increase similar to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (complementary).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries compared to that in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA and UK countries reported the total number of cases already similar to that in Italy just 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, despite different national public health responses, and the possibility of case definition differences in different countries and protocols to select patients who should be tested for COVID-19, including follow-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation where nearly 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospital admissions and/or ICUs for COVID-19 cases at EU/EEA level is currently available for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, it must be systematically collected to complete current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed significant diversity in the availability of intensive care and moderate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Scenarios for gratification-related modelling of healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA/UK country for the prevalence of COVID-19 cases that have entered the hospital associated with the risk of “90% to exceed the capacity of ICU beds, are available in the sixth update for the rapid COVID-19 risk assessment at the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.
Because cases so far have been collected in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and ICUs typically serve specific regional populations, it is preferable to provide information on cases and ICU beds at the 2 NUTs-2 designation level.
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare themselves for the sustainable community transition scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and increase the number of COVID-19 patients in need of healthcare, particularly intensive care, such as in affected areas in Italy.
According to the ECDC rapid risk assessment, a comprehensive proactive rapid approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 while shifting from containment to mitigation, as the rapid expected increase in the number of cases may not provide decision-makers and hospitals with sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly in case they are not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited opportunity for countries to increase their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to experience an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, causing a humanitarian catastrophe.
Similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which infected thousands of people with SARS-CoV-2 in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more mobile and impactful among older people than young people and men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications related to the emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review on the topic of rapidly developing research.
We will address the basics related to epidemiology, its causes, its virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention.
Although many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that poses a threat.
On January 25, 2020, the Spring Festival became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were urged to stay inside their homes throughout the holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; hence, it was named by the World Health Organization (WHO) in SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and called the disease associated with COVID-19 (CoV-19).
The pandemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus led to 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy of the No. 1 public” and is likely to be stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published including its own virus science, epidemiology, causes, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the isolated virus through many patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new topic field that is rapidly developing.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by COVID, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, a 2012 outbreak).
We’ll also discuss what we’ve learned so far about disease prevention and predicting its progress as well as some of the pressing questions that are still on the table.
Coronaviruses are usually considered non-lethal pathogens in humans, and have mainly caused about 15% of the common 4 colds.
However, in this century, we faced coronaviruses causing severe diseases in humans twice, i.e. SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, which caused an outbreak of the disease originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread the disease to many other countries at a terrifying rate of spread and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is a third outbreak of COVID-19 in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, groups with idiopathic pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
Meanwhile, the pandemic has rapidly spread to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, suggesting the possibility of transmission of the disease from person to person.
On January 23, Wuhan City was closed with all public transport shutting down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that among confirmed cases of infection of 41 patients, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan Seafood Market, which considered the site of initiation of infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak as a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and around 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak must still be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed COVID-19, provided more updated clarification of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 hit people of all age groups, but it hit the age groups between 30 and 65 mainly.
Nearly half of the injured (47.7%) were 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 hit a number of men (0.31/100,000) more women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is expanding between groups in and around Hubei mainly.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the start of the injury to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average infection time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Primary reproduction number (basic reproduction number) 3.77 (Trust range is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and modified primary reproduction number is 2.23-4.82.
The number of people affected increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, in line with the many travel operations before the Spring Festival in China.
The percentage of deaths among confirmed patients was 1.44% (Trust range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the percentage of modified deaths for all patients was 3.06% (Trust range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and acute pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a species of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single-chain nucleic acid genome under direction.
It can be divided into four races, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, and it is known that alpha and beta-sexual coronaviruses infect humans.
The sugar-coated fork (S) is associated with its cellular receptors — angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dieptidylpeptidase 4 (DB4) — for SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after the viral genome is cloned, genomic RNA is accompanied by glucocorticoids and vesicle-fibroblast proteins containing feriones, which merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus afterwards.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of more than 99.98% between 10 sequencing samples collected from the original location of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market of Poohan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
The electronic microscopic examination of the transmission revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
Angiotensin2-converting human enzyme has been revealed to be the future of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is associated with the human-converting angiotensin enzyme 2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a short, new protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b at SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenic ability and limit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou and others reported the entire length structure of angiotensin-converting human enzyme 2 under a 2.9 Å ultra-cold electron microscope within a compound with a B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had gathered to form a demerit and that the ACE2-B0AT1 can bind the S protein, providing evidence of coronavirus recognition and infection.
A neutral, sodium-based amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for testing medicines to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and middle host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV originated from bats and transported to humans through yoghurt and beauty cats, respectively.
By comparing the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to other coronaviruses, the original host bat of SARS-CoV-2, where the new virus corresponds to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus traverse the interfaith barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and has not yet been clarified in the transition path.
J et al suggested snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved a symmetrical recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China suggested that squamous anteaters — long-legged mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are the possible host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homage in the coronavirus detected in squamous anteaters and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1% spread along the genome is still a big difference; hence, we are waiting for conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The chemical physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment up to 5 days at a temperature below 20°C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to UV and temperature at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75% concentration, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race is generally lacking immunity against SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to be infected with the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response has been found.
Therefore, we can refer only to previous studies related to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invasion of the host, it is recognized by the natural immune system through pattern recognition receptors (BRS) including type C receptors similar to flax, the receptor similar to tulle (TLR), receptors similar to the band of nucleotides (NR), and the receptor similar to the RIG-I (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus stimulates the appearance of inflammation factors, the maturity of synthesized cells, and the installation of I-type interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large phagocytic cells of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T cells help produce inflammation-activated cytokines to help the cells defend.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell functions by inducing programmed T-cell death.
Blended immunity, including supplement proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, I neutralize isolated antibodies from a recovered MIRS-CoV patient.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst likelihood, failure to function multiple organs and death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions have been damaged to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or mostly between 3 and 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged between 0 and 24 days.
A newer study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing people with infection but not experiencing symptoms of transmission of the virus to others.
As a common practice, people who are exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to undergo quarantine for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, and can not be accompanied by any or other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal bumps, chest pain, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients suffered from shortness of breath and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thrombopathies.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even without a photocopy that detects pulmonary abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies for a group of families and a group to which the infection was transmitted from a person who did not show symptoms.
Compared to a 2012 demographic study, patients with MIRS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80 of them needed much more respiratory support from COVID-19 patients and aligned with the highest rates of HIV/AIDS.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) are also observed in Myers patients.
In SARS patients, it turns out that both fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the most important symptoms, and that respiratory support is required for about 14%-20% of patients.
By February 14, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, while confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By November 2002, the death rate from SARS was 10% of confirmed cases of 8,096.
For Meirs, the mortality rate was 37% of confirmed cases of 2,494, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2’s primary breeding number was up to 6.47 with a 95% CCA trust range from 5.71 to 7.23, while the primary reproduction number for SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and primary reproduction number is shown in table1.1.
The above figures indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than Myers-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less deadly than the latter.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more difficult to control than the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The onset of the disease occurs at gatherings often in the same family, from the same gathering or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or being in contact with people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it is reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have gone out of hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, the lack of lymphocytes with white blood cell counts 4×109/L including the number of lymphocytes 1×109/L, high levels of aspartaate carrier and blood transverse in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin have risen in the blood of some patients, and the increase in C-reactive protein and the rate of red blood cell heaviness in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-demerged, caused by fibrin cracking in the blood, has gradually decreased the number of lymphocytes.
The imbalances in radiography appear in most COVID-19 patients and are characterized by double opaque shades or opaque glass that is drained in the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, out-of-control inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Functional dysfunction of pulmonary cells of type 1 and type 2 reduces the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, hence, reduces the ability of the lungs to stretch and increases the risk of collapse of the lung.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography and maximum severity of the disease are often compared.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the exfoliation of pulmonary cells, the formation of the hyaluronic membrane, interstitial lymphatic infiltration, and the many-core cellular cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, in line with viral infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to what happens to patients with SARS and Myers.
SARS-CoV-2's RNA detection through the polymerase chain reaction of reverse transcription (PTCR) has been used as a key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative outcome rate, which may accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations of diagnosis (which no longer depend individually on RT-PCR) began in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiographic discoveries is essential and essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the FengChang Group described a protocol to use CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, and it detects pieces of synthesized SARS-CoV-2 DNA at a rate of 20 x 10-18 mmol/L to 200 x 10-18 mmol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dip in less than an hour without the need for micro-devices.
We hope that the new technology will be able to significantly improve sensitivity and suitability if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide primarily supportive care for COVID-19 patients, while experimenting with a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, Myers-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These include current and potential treatments for antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, and plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and anti-virus vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first, and may also attack, and to a lesser extent, other organs that emit ACE2, such as the digestive system, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure represent the most serious threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Respiratory support is therefore essential for relieving symptoms and saving lives, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive ventilators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function, are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to result from an overactive reaction of the immune system in SARS and Myers patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reactions characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Activated hormones, tosilizomap, and monoclonal anti-interlockin 6, were used to treat a cytokine storm.
Other cytokine immunosuppression treatments include T-cell-guided immune reaction modification; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; Plinatumumab; and cytokine 4 signal captulators; and Histon deciles inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, in larger doses, steroids were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, severe side effects, especially avascular bone necrosis, can severely affect the prediction of the disease.
However, I have recommended short cycles of stimulant hormones in doses between small and medium doses with caution for critical cases of COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it has been discovered that the administration of Remdecifer, a neoclitide analog, and IV was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdecifer is a novel antiviral initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg.
Later, remdesifer also showed potential inhibition of other single-series ribosic nucleic acid viruses, including the Meyers and SARS virus.
Based on these viruses, Gilead provided the compound to China to conduct some experiments on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, paristienep, interferon-alpha, lopenavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after the Blobenavir/ritonavir complex treatment.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and antibody generation
Blood collection from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease itself or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease has a long history.
Already, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (AGs) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies. They recognize and neutralize unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, the plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation, viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to put forward this method for widespread use before reaching specific treatments.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an excessively stimulating immune reaction and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is likely to be a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is significant for the treatment of critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, the isolation of B cells from recovering patients and the identification of genetic codes that encode effective antibodies, or the examination of active antibodies against essential proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a range of multiple components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on traditional Chinese medicine theories.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or ambiguous as they are difficult to extract and check these ingredients or their optimal formulations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the important alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Shu Feng Ji-do capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules for COVID-19 treatment has been discovered.
The highest cure rates in COVID-19 treatment were observed in several provinces of China that used traditional Chinese medicine in 87% of its patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used traditional Chinese medicine only with about 30% of Covid-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a completely approximate comparison, as many other factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their cases should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Poly Zhang and his business partners published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (W.M.) individually with the combined treatment of Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They discovered that the periods needed to recover from high body temperature, the demise of symptoms, and hospitalization were much shorter in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Group compared to only Western Medicine Treatment Group.
Most impressive, the worsening rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Group compared to the Western Medicine Treatment Group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine Treatment Group compared to the Western Medicine Treatment Group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-thought-out trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of procedures and to clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or formulations if possible.
People suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 are often very frightened and even fatal, and people who are quarantined are bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by stimulants, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
As part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact and quarantine tracking can make people more anxious and guiltful about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their entire family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected people, people in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and plans to treat it, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact with each other.
Effective vaccines to cut off the chain of transmission of the virus from animal warehouses and infected humans to vulnerable hosts are essential and often complementary to antiviral treatment in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The debilitating live vaccines were evaluated in animal models for the treatment of SARS.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body in older adults and deadly challenge models has not been identified and they are protected from infection with the source animal virus before starting a clinical study.
Perhaps this is because SARS has faded 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
In contrast, cases and disparate groups with MIERS continue to appear in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in infested areas.
MERS immunization strategies were developed using an inactive virus, oxygen-deficit RNA plasms, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, overcoming the difficulty is a challenge due to the length of time (average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic changes to the coronavirus.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical path during thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without punishments.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and Myers, is also associated with high prevalence rates of disease and mortality in severe patients.
Therefore, building a model for disease progress expectations is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in limited-resource areas.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may influence or relate to the progress of the disease in COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: It was the most important working age to determine the progress of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
The 30-65-year-olds were mainly infected with COVID-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were much older than those who did not need it (average age 66 vs 51), indicating age as a predictive factor for the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 hit a higher number of men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/1000,000), as described above.
Concomitant diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart injuries and arrhythmias.
Heart accidents were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive bile cells with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which can lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and underlying disease are strongly associated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory outcomes: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and is suggested to be a predictive factor for the disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The correlation between C-level and the severity of COVID-19 disease and the expectations of its functioning is also suggested.
In addition, the rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate amine carrier (AST), aalanine carrier enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the result.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunctions of the heart or liver.
Main clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and progress on clinical symptoms need to be considered together alongside other problems to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dose of stimulant hormones has been widely used in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered AVN with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used in a low dose and for a short time in COVID-19 patients, if necessary.
Mental stress: As explained above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of family close members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients with early stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing it to be difficult to control the pandemic.
However, it was considered that the SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are in a severe medical condition, while most transmissions of the virus did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
strenuous efforts are currently being made in China, including the closure of Wuhan, surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all residents in the hope of hindering the transition of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have greatly affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating a slowdown in the pandemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the regression phase will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have the same amount of optimism.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in mid-lane and throat swabs for patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may become a cyclical episode similar to the flu.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases declining, which suggests that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
Like SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually disappears or becomes a less diseased virus that coexists with humans.
The following is a comparison of the Covid-19 pandemic with the SARS and Myers epidemic below (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with substances contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, raising a new possibility of moving from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, significant precautions are required to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders who have communicated with patients or infected people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection. Using both surgery masks and N95 respiratory masks (No. 1860s series) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, N95 masks (series 1860s) can only protect against inhalation of small phyrons between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of phyrons being able to fully penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to approximately 85 nm each.
Because the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks stacked together, healthcare providers should directly contact patients to wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear appropriate isolation robes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing the N95 mask; the virus may have entered its body through its inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shields or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with an antiseptic soap more often than usual, trying to stay at home for self-quarantine and reduce contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is a convenient distance to keep people away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its intense resemblance to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan did not reassure citizens until January 19, 2020, saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely underscored public alert, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and put a critical time to contain the disease at its lowest scale in Wuhan.
China’s disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must be (1) more cautious when issuing public data because each word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and interactive with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more relevant and effective trainings to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases, and periodically test and improve the community’s response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 began at the end of December 2019.
It spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has triggered a feeling of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older individuals than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older adults than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients even have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually do this when they are severely ill, causing more difficulty containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
The normal SARS-CoV-2 DNA test can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovering patients can get the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With such rapid advances in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of 96% of genetic symmetry between SARS-CoV-2 and similar SARS-CoV-2 virus in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What kind of animal was the intermediate that transmits the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, we cannot stop the transition efficiently, and the outbreak can return again at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with ACE2 secreted cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this pandemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during its transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, fading like SARS, or going back periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to look for the answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, at what cost it may take, we have no other choice but to stop the pandemic as quickly as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal Assets of Human Coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation have led the joint development of coronaviruses (Coronaviruses) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) caused a mild illness, such as a cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has shown the opposite face to reveal to what extent human coronavirus infections can be serious and life-threatening.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 led to a re-highlight of coronaviruses, and we quickly surprised its spread but with the ability to cause the disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
The human coronavirus is a zoonotic disease so our understanding of animal origins of human coronaviruses would serve us well.
Most of the human coronavirus comes from bats as they were not pathogenic.
The intermediate warehouse hosts of some human coronaviruses have also been known.
Identifying host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interactive relationships between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of available information about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as animal assets and the transition between species.
The most important thing is that we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
In this context, the disease caused by the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the successful host switching requirements and the impact of complications of virus progression in the severity of the disease.
Corona viruses (Coronaviruses) belong to the coronavirus family, which includes a group of single-chain nucleic acid-ribozi coated viruses under direction.
These viruses contain the largest genome among the viruses with RNA, as it is from 26 to 32 kilos, and it is called " coronaviruses" by this name because their installation is similar to the crown under an electronic microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain fragmented genomes that share similar regulation.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large interlaced reading blocks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which turn into multiple proteins cloned in pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including spike (S), shell (E), membrane (M) and nuclear protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encrypt a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (Corona alpha virus, beta virus, gamma virus, and Delta coronavirus), including the types of beta coronavirus that include most human coronaviruses and are divided into four strains (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence of genetic development has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most of the Alpha coronaviruses and Beta coronaviruses, while birds are the main repository of gamma coronaviruses and Delta coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as a cause of serious human diseases.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (human coronaviruses) are known.
Among them is the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-NL63, which belong to the alpha coronaviruses.
The other five coronaviruses include the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1, the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
The human corona virus-229E, the human corona virus-OC43, the human corona virus-HKU1, and the human corona virus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as colds, diarrhea, or both.
By contrast, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus is all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections to a greater number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and nonpulmonary symptoms.
The human coronavirus-229E, the first strain B814, was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with colds in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been collected by intensive studies conducted on the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43, whose symptoms are automatically cured.
In fact, it was generally accepted that infection with human coronavirus was harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the deadliest epidemics in our present history, with 8,000 people infected with approximately 10% deaths.
Ten years later, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks a steady epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with a sparse spread to the rest of the world.
COVID-19, which was renamed to SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and injured more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell sounds and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins from bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses from bats, as viruses are well adapted, not pathogenic, but show significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origins of human coronavirus has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for species navigation.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARSCoV-2 warehouse, intermediate host and amplified host animal (amplified host animal), with significant impacts to prevent future ramifications.
In this review we provide an overview of animal origins, transitions between species, and human coronaviruses cause diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that indigenous viruses are usually non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after they move between species to a new host.
We also review the evaluation of the course of the human coronavirus as it is often accompanied by an increase in its portability of a decrease in the severity of the disease.
In this context, we also discuss the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of HIV-229E was first isolated from nasal secretions of patients with colds, different types of coronavirus were isolated from various infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat, and dog.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronavirus have been identified.
Viewing a brief summary of the history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of the human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with an upper respiratory infection in 1966, and then adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
People with HIV-229E have common cold symptoms, including headaches, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with a fever, and coughing in approximately 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transmission was in the brains of infant mice.
The clinical features of the human coronavirus-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by the human coronavirus-229E, which cannot be distinguished by symptoms from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
Both the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43 have spread globally and tend to move around during the winter season in a temperate climate.
In general, the incubation time of these viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of disease for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer study, people who are healthy with HIV-229E have caused mild colds.
Only a few patients with immunodeficiency showed severe injury to the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first coronavirus pandemic to be well documented in human history and the causative agent is SARS-CoV, the third detected human coronavirus.
The first case of SARS is due to late 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the supercontagion carrier, it has been estimated that one condition can lead to about two secondary conditions, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and a peak viral load appears on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, chills, and are followed as late symptoms of difficulty breathing, coughing, and respiratory distress.
Lack of lymph nodes, liver dysfunction, and high creatine kinase are common laboratory imbalances for SARS.
In SARS patients, it is also noted that there is widespread alveolar damage, the multiplication of epithelial cells, and the increase in the number of phagocytic cells.
About 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases, many organs can also develop the digestive system, liver and kidneys, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case that traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to conduct research on the human coronavirus.
The human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common symptoms of the disease caused by HIV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the virus itself from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Despite being discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread globally.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for nearly 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak occurs during early summer, spring, and winter.
The human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as thrombitis.
In the same year, the human coronavirus-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, human coronavirus-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma attacks.
The human coronavirus-HKU1 is found to be widespread globally, and causes mild respiratory diseases, similar to the human coronavirus-NL63, the human coronavirus-229E, and the human coronavirus-OC43.
All four of these human coronaviruses acquired from society have adapted well to humans and in general the possibility of mutating to cause diseases characterized by low prevalence, but coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the most aggressive subtype of human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe infections of the lower respiratory tract in China.
In general, when coronaviruses gain this ability to move efficiently and sustain themselves within humans, they also become less harmful or diseased.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia it has been reported on cases brought from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of contacts in close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 which resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by Myers are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by worsening acute pneumonia.
Contrary to SARS, many people with meers also experienced acute kidney failure, which is characterised by meers from the rest of the diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were reported in vitro with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients later known to be the result of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, Hubei province, were discovered in China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the current outbreak of a lower respiratory infection due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is an emergency of public health of international importance as called COVID-19.
On March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial mortality rate of 3.4%.
Deaths in Hubei, China are 4.2%, while abroad is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, which appear in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the large homogeneity in nucleotide sequencing by 82%, they belong to different branches in the evolution tree of the breeds.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is less severe but more contagious than SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV.
People who are asymptomatic may have been reported to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparison and divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses have revealed similarities and differences of great importance.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and the time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society (i.e., human coronavirus-229E, human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, and human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has more common features in cases of human coronaviruses acquired from society, including indefinite or minor symptoms or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the percentage is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission shows interesting patterns for both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.
On the one hand, the portability of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the community-acquired human coronavirus transmission.
On the other hand, checking whether the portability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after the transmission to humans as in cases of SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth paying attention to whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of human coronavirus acquired from the community.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including the possibility of transition, the mechanism of disease and sustainable deployment after the transition to humans will have an impact on the final fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from society and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may be survivors of ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses that infect humans have been eliminated with acute diseases as well as humans who have been infected with acute human coronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, you should copy human coronaviruses in humans enough to allow adaptive mutations facing host-restricted factors to accumulate.
Proceeding from this logic, the longer SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more infected, the more likely it will be to fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four coronaviruses acquired by society are spread among human populations over many years, causing the common cold in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal repository.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, which cause severe morbidity, did not adapt well to humans, and were unable to continue the transition between humans.
They need to stay in their animal reservoirs and multiply and then look for the right opportunity to move to the most vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by similar features to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired by the community.
It is highly contagious such as human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for the time being.
However, it causes the disease more than human coronaviruses acquired by society and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether or not it will adapt fully to humans and spread between them without the need for a warehouse or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, depot, intermediate, and amplified hosts of human coronaviruses.
The animal plays the role of the evolutionary host of the human corona virus if the virus harbors the close origin related to it and shares great symmetry in the level of nucleotides.
The original virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathetic to this host.
Similarly, the warehouse host shelters the human coronavirus continuously and over the long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and the hosts are natural to the human coronavirus or the father's virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the newly intermediary host before attacking humans or near it, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of infection for humans as it performs the role of the amplified host by allowing the virus to be copied temporarily and thus transferred to humans to expand the spread of infection between humans.
A human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to travel from within the middle host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediary host so that they can settle for a long time.
In this case, the middle host becomes the natural repository host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a contact history with the gamers.
Serum prevalence surveys then indicated that animal dealers have a higher prevalence rate of SARS-CoV compared to ordinary people.
It was first identified that convincing sieves (Pagoma larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal selling markets carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supported the fact that no other SARS case was reported after all of the yoghurt cats were killed in the markets.
However, the result of the SARS-CoV test in convincing wilderness palm yoghurt or farms without being exposed to live animal markets has been largely negative, suggesting that convincing palm yoghurt may be an only intermediate amplifying host, but not the natural repository of SARS-CoV.
Noting that as 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets had antibodies to SARS-CoV, the probability that multiple types of small mammals also play the role of SARS-CoV's supernova host is not excluded.
All of these seem to be hosts who do not transmit SARS-CoV.
The later search for the SARS-CoV animal’s natural host led to the closely related bat coronavirus, called the Chinese horseshoe bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 (the Chinese horseshoe bat virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bat.
The result of SARS-CoV antibody screening in these bats and the sequence of Chinese horseshoe bat genomes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other coronaviruses of bats share a symmetry of 88-92% nucleotides with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Many coronaviruses similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) have been identified from bats, but none of them could be isolated as a living virus except WIV1.
Human Angiotensin 2 converted enzyme (Angiotensin 2 converted enzyme) is the future of SARS-CoV.
The WIV1 extracted from a feces sample of a bat has been shown to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in the bat, and to cat yoghurt, and humans as a receiver to enter the cell.
Interestingly, the cured serum for severe acute respiratory syndrome has been able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 is the virus most associated with SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% symmetry of nucleotides.
Despite the high symmetry between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct father of SARS-CoV virus and that bats are not a direct repository host of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of the evolution of the breeds MERS-CoV in the coronavirus-HKU4 group combines the bat and the coronavirus-HKU5 into the bat itself.
The coronavirus-HKU4 in bats and Meyers-CoV uses the host's own receiver, a dipeptidyl-Peptidase4 (dipeptidyl-Peptidase4), to enter the virus.
MERS-CoV DNA-based polymerase sequences are closer in terms of the evolution of strains to their beta coronavirus counterparts in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Meyers-Cove lives in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and HKU25 are involved in the bat closest to it in the analogy of just 87% nucleotides.
Thus, the host bat may not be the direct repository of Mercer-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only serum-positive beauty of MERS-CoV antibodies, as well as beauty of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
The miers-cove neighborhood corresponding to the virus in humans is isolated from the nasal swabs of the only hump beauty, noting that beauty plays the role of the original repository host of the miers-cove.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms appeared in general in beauty that was experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, but it was observed with heavy viral scattering.
The affected beauty was markedly spreading viruses not only by breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the primary route for splashing the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed cases of meers do not have a contact history with beauty before symptoms appear, and these cases were attributed in terms of logic to a human-to-human transition or anonymous transmission methods that include unrecognized species of animals sheltering meers-Cove.
SARS-CoV-2 covid-19 RaTG13 is involved in horseshoe bats isolated in 96.2% nucleotides symmetry.
The sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV-2 and Myers-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct repository of SARS-CoV-2 host(s) unless the bat coronavirus is found to be almost identical in the future.
The intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 are supposed to be among the types of wild animals sold and killed in the Wuhan Seafood Market, which have been associated with many primary COVID-19 cases, suggesting the possibility of an animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on the Metagenome sequence suggested that a group of small, endangered mammals known as squamous anteater (Manis javanica) could also harbor beta-origin coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
These ants’ new coronavirus genomes and SARS-CoV-2 share 85-92% symmetry of nucleotides.
However, they are closely associated with RaTG13 with the similarity of about 90% at the level of nucleotides.
In two subspecies of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses, one of them shares similar receptor correlations with SARS-CoV-2, matching 97.4% of amino acid sequences.
In stark contrast, future link areas for SARS-CoV-2 differ from RaTG13, although whole genome sequencing is higher.
A previous study of squamous anteater patients also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, and it turned out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different collection methods and manual processing to generate partial genome sequencing consisting of a virus genome of approximately 86.3% full length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that squamous anteater is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous ants eaters are the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in squamous ants eaters.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-associated beta coronaviruses in squamous anteater.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 remains in bats, squamous anteater, and other mammals under appointment.
While the highest sequential symmetry has been found in the fields of receptor correlation between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous anteater, the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 coronaviruses share the highest symmetry of whole genome sequencing.
One of the most common speculation is that the high degree of similarity in the areas of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binders in squamous anteater belonging to the coronavirus beta and SARS-CoV-2 is guided by selective rapprochemental development.
There is a counter-proposition that is likely to recombinate between SARS-CoV-2 in squamous anteaters belonging to the coronavirus beta and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Recombination is widespread among beta coronaviruses as a driving force for development.
The direct animal origin of SARS Cove-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, he has also studied the animal origin of the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-NL63, and the human coronavirus-HKU1.
Evidence of the evolution of the breeds has indicated that both the human coronavirus-NL63 and the human coronavirus-229E may have originated from the bat coronaviruses, while the father coronavirus of the human coronavirus-OC43 and the human coronavirus-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Covid-19 of the Appalachian Highlands) detected in tricolor bats in North America has a close relationship with the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the human coronavirus-229E was found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and the hives were also suspected of being their mediator host.
To illustrate, current information on animal origins of known human coronaviruses has been summed up in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of the evolution of strains provided evidence of cases of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the human coronavirus-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, the respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of the transmission of the human coronavirus-229E between species is still less noticeable.
Alpha coronaviruses in bats have been found to be relevant to the human coronavirus-229E.
Among them is the Alpha Corona virus in Alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpaca, may have contact with bats in a shared ecological habitat.
While humans have close contact with Alpaca.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the Alpha coronavirus in bats is multiple and not pathogenic in bats, while the Alpha virus in alpaca causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca-associated coronavirus has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that Alpaca was infected with the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the alpha coronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit the human coronavirus-229E to humans directly.
While Alpha coronaviruses in bats play the role of synthesizing the genes of the human coronavirus-229E, Alpaca and the only beauty of the hump may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just like in the Meyers-Cove.
The Meyers-Cove gives an excellent example of transition between species as it moves from bats to the only hump beauty and from the only hump beauty to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV was known from bats from the beginning of identification and was also enhanced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus types to exchange gene pieces within the single type and transfer them between the species.
Bats are long-lived, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all under favorable conditions to make them a perfect “virus distributor”.
On the other hand, Meyers-Cove has moved to the only beauty of hump for decades.
It may adapt to this beauty to adapt well until it turned from a middle host to a natural and stable repository host.
Meyers-Cove causes a very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains a coincidence and a human being is a non-transmitter host for Meyers-Cove where his transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of beauty in the transfer of Myers-CoV, the role of squamous anteater, if any, in the transition of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the coronavirus beta associated with squamous anteater infects it with severe disease.
They may be non-conveying hosts for SARS-CoV-2 belonging to the beta coronavirus, similar to a butter cat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will resolve many possibilities for the transition of SARS-CoV-2 between species of animals to humans either by proving or excluding them.
First, bats may be a host of a repository of a virus linked to SARS-CoV-2, which is mostly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an environmental habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous anteater can be one of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2-associated intermediate amplifier hosts.
Humans become infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming chervil meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be at risk of developing SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of antibodies in pets and wild animals is justified.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS Cove-2 may have been re-installed and adapted in a third type that has contact with bats and squamous anteater.
The search for animal origin for SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, from the viral side there are three main and also important factors in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to overcome the barriers of species.
First, mutation rates are relatively high in RNA doubling.
The rates of estimated coronavirus mutations, compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered “medium” or “high” with an average switching rate of ~ 10-4 switching cases each year for site 2, depending on the stage of adapting the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include an external reconclase enzyme, which removes it to very high transmutability and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, remdesivir is known for its ability to suppress covid-19 cloning by inhibiting the enzyme of external ribonuclease and RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Remdecifer is one of the anti-SARSCoV-2 gracious agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations increase by about one million times more than the rates of hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, which indicates a higher level of human adaptation.
It seems that he has already adapted to another host close to man.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which adapts well to the only beauty of the hump.
Theoretically, genetic deviation is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 quickly weaken its effectiveness.
Secondly, the mega-RNA genome in coronavirus actively provides additional genome modification for mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of common development among species, which benefits the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is backed by unique abundant open-reading templates and encrypted protein functions near the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently switch molds during RNA cloning through the unique “copy selection” mechanism.
In a host like a blending vessel, sequencing frequently occurs during covid-19 RNA transcription.
High-metabolic full-length and secondary genomic RNAs may recombinate to generate new coronaviruses.
A special guide to the evolution of strains has been discovered for the natural recombination of human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-OC43, as well as animal coronavirus-like acute respiratory syndrome virus severe bats and coronavirus-HKU9 in bats.
Virus interaction with host associated with transition
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor in the transition between species.
In this regard, we address the recombination of SARS-CoV as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during cross species transmission accidents.
Based on comparative analysis of isolated SARS-CoV samples in humans and yoghurt cat, SARS-CoV was thought to be undergoing rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the receptor binding field of SS protein.
In general, the field of correlating receptors to the coronavirus S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is heavily selected through the body’s anti-host response.
In SARS-CoV, the amino acid receptor binding field from 318 to 510 occurs in plot S1, which is associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as well as receptors that help enter the virus.
SARS-CoV's receptor binding field is able to identify angiotensin2-converting enzyme receptors that help with different animals, including a bat, a yoghurt cat, a mouse, and a raccoon dog, which allows the virus to be transmitted between species.
In fact, the remains of only 6 amino acids that were different from the human viral isolated specimens and the yoghurt in the receptor binding field were observed, and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding sequence pattern to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The K479N and S487T mutations are in the field of SARS-CoV receptor binding in the yoghurt cat, which can increase the likelihood of spike protein reacting to the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receiver as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein, which implicitly indicates that the probability of association of S-protein in human ACE2 has changed.
A study of ultra-cold electron microscope has already indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this correlation compared to that of the human ACE2 and SARS-CoV.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of help receptor may be necessary for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 but in a different part of the protein S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as the HPV-229E protein analyzer, and the 9-O Sialic Acid for the HPV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after the transition between species from their animal host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the transition between species is also governed by other factors of dependence and limitations in the host.
The diffusion of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of coronaviruses, such as bats, lone beauty humps, and rodents can be an obstacle to the transition between species.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken the constraints factors in them to carry out a successful transition between species.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important space for the virus to interact with the host remain detectable and identify properties.
Unbiased screening on the genome can be used to research SARSCoV-2 host reliability and restrictions using the cutting-edge CRISPR technology.
Emerging Human Coronavirus Outcome: Returning to the Starting Point
The variety of coronaviruses in bats offers abundant opportunities for the emergence of emerging human coronaviruses.
Proceeding from this logic, coronaviruses in bats are a genetic compound for human coronaviruses.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also pushes the development of the human coronavirus and are two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of emerging protein crypto genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV's regulatory proteins, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, with SARS-CoV associated with viruses isolated in bats but found to be encoding differentiated ORF8 proteins.
The 29 properties of SARS-CoV's nucleotide deletion were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes switching hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through the Alpha and Gamma coronavirus strains, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in RNA polymerase based on RNA.
Reinstallation locations are also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic has seen cases of recombination between different strains, which have occurred in the only beauty of hump in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV, recombination cases are also observed in other human coronaviruses, with human coronaviruses and other animal coronaviruses installed in their own non-structural genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which result from the elimination of viruses from selective stressors, such as by the host’s immune system.
The complete length loss of ORF4 protein in the human coronavirus-229E phenotype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotide is an example of these effects.
Although ORF4 can be observed in beauty and bat viruses associated with the human coronavirus-229E, the alpaca virus shows only one nucleotide stitches, which leads to a mutation in the control framework.
Last but not least, the development of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their warehouse hosts.
Unaccompanied or mildly symptomatic cases have only been detected when a bat is infected with coronavirus, which indicates the mutual adaptation between coronavirus and a bat.
They showed that bats adapted appropriately to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, the poor revitalization of the inflammatory response in bats effectively reduced the pathogens provoked by coronaviruses.
In addition, natural killer cellular activity was suppressed in bats due to an increase in NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receiver rate and a decrease in the expression of the main class I textile compatibility compound molecules.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (reactive oxygen compounds) arising from the rise in the metabolic activity of bat can lead to both replication of the coronavirus and the effect of rectification by external ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when a new host is infected.
Additional disease-causing strains may arise from the coronavirus by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three emerging human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in depot hosts such as bats and beauty.
They reproduce strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here lies the secrets that explain why the virus carriers who do not show symptoms and the causes of severe cases of human infection.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by overactivity of the immune response and the storm of cytokine where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of unsymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from the covid-19 cloning.
A similar immune response detachment strategy may have beneficial effects in anti-SARSCoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the intake of interferon type I can be used at least in the first phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflamed particle creapyrine NLRRP3 activation in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, NLRP3 inhibition using MCC950 inhibitor is useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea in which SARS-CoV and Myers-CoV originated.
While it was discovered that the beta coronavirus in bats involved SARS-CoV in a 95% nucleotide homogeneity, there was also coronavirus in bats involved 96% of nucleotide homogeneity with SARS-CoV-2.
While it was discovered that yoghurt cats and other animals in the markets harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV that did not detect SARS-CoV-2 intermediate direct hosts.
Coronavirus Beta has been discovered in squamous anteater, which is very homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that squamous ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant ant aegis, or that the coronavirus beta in squamous ant ant ant ant ant ant ant aemony has been cut off genetically, leading to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions are still on the table, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not intentionally or incidentally man-made.
Coronaviruses have returned to the hotbed due to the start of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our idea of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal repositories of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that the SARS-CoV, Myers-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are all due to its origin to the bat and moved to man via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that the SARS-CoV infection originated from human-yoghurt cats in the markets, the closure of fresh product markets and the killing of yoghurt cats was supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
In the same mental sense, squamous anteater animals should be disposed of from fresh product markets to prevent the transmission of zoonotic disease, in light of the discovery of multiple beta coronavirus genes in squamous ant ant ant ant ant anteater, which are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS-CoV-2 has moved to humans, as well as whatever its method of transmission, through squamous anteater animals and other mammals, its transmission remains a topic that needs clarification in future research.
Meyers-Cove, on the other hand, was found in the only beauty of the hump for a long time.
This beauty is an important means of transportation as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa region.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all beauty to control Meiers, similar to what officials in China’s wildlife markets have done to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the frequent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be taken to develop effective anti-Beauty vaccines for MERS-CoV, as well as other infection control measures.
For us to permanently eliminate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
There is a variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses vary extremely in bats that have the potential to cause zoonotic diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and re-installation of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases, which leads to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transferable and/or fatal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In light of the human adversity due to SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a proper preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The fact is that a lot of viruses have taken their place in the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural warehouses until they come with an opportunity to spread and multiply.
Although bats carry many characteristics that are likely to spread viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other types of wild animals can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Monitoring mammals in an ongoing manner is necessary to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and preventing future occurrences.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonotic diseases is to move people away from the ecological sites of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
The mystery of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 animal disease is still surrounded by many questions that require answering it.
First, if bats transmit the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to squamous anteater, it is important to know the conditions that are prepared for the participation of bats and squamous anteater animals in the similar ecological place.
Secondly, if the bats play a more direct role in the transmission of the disease to humans, then the way the human contact with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of a real intermediate host, then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous anteater.
Finally, since many mammals, including pets, may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental infection should be done.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous anteater or other mammals, SARSCoV-2 or the father's viruses that branch from it and that are almost similar in their future natural hosts are expected to be identified.
Ongoing research in this field reveals the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and combat COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the “suspect case” and “confirmed case” standard when diagnosing COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick guidance on diagnosing and treating COVID-19 2019 (COVID-2019), and this guidance provided our experience and included relevant reference information to combat the pandemic globally.
Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experiences; hence, diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this speech, we answered a comment on our guidance and presented the latest diagnostic criteria, a “suspect case” and a “confirmed case,” in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines (version VII) issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-2019), which is now officially known as 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization described COVID-19 as the pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team formulated a quick guidance and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has received great attention since its publication.
Please note that while COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn), were issued between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, seven overall versions with some contexts fundamentally changing.
Our guidance is now responding to a comment from Zhou and others, providing a simple clinical trial-based grade monitoring proposal.
Their efforts have added a new guideline as well as a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their great effort and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (the seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the suspected case confirmation needs to combine any element of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to reach a comprehensive analysis, or it needs to achieve three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) A history of travel to the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where reports of COVID-19 cases occurred, or resided, within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of communication with cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive DNA test results); (3) a history of communication with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan or surrounding areas or other communities where reports of COVID-19 cases occurred within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of communication with a combination of confirmed cases (2 or more people with fever and/or respiratory symptoms that occurred during 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office or classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with the characteristics of COVID-19 screening; (3) showing the total number of white blood cells a normal, little, or low level of the number of early-stage lymphocytes to start infection.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case involving any of the elements of the presence of pathogens or serum reactions must be based on: (1) positive real-time PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogenization of the whole viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus properties; (3) positive results of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody IgG-2 test; or the negative-to-positive IgG antibody in SARS-CoV-2, or the high-calibration in the recovery phase is equal to or more than 4 times that level in the acute phase.
We see that real-time PCR test of DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); then the Manual of Whey Reactions was added to the seventh version.
These adjustments have relied on the work of ongoing researchers to design an ideal DNA detection toolkit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which has led to an increased availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of the positive result of the qualitative antibody to confirmed case standards.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that calls us to be careful when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and uncompromised conditions.
Therefore, the content of the information flow chart for Zhou and others should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms in the "low risk" degree.
The grading monitoring system also needs to be validated in practice and additional clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to access more direct evidence and invite readers to provide us with their feedback.
To diagnose “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we call for the most up-to-date guidance from home countries to be followed.
Our team will also update our guidance in time to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, until yesterday, there were 114 active cases and 33 recoveries in homes.
17 deaths have been recorded.
The Director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirgadi Sabrina Flora, stated in an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases above 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two deaths from Dhaka were.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
An official at a hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the deceased is Jalal Seif al-Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
The Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaid al-Qader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would stop longer than initially scheduled until next Saturday.
Public transport was initially disrupted on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods is still permitted: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people who returned from Italy, as well as the wife of one.
The three have already recovered by March 19th.
SARS-CoV-2 million infections worldwide
The data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, which is known as SARS-CoV-2, exceeded one million cases around the world.
COVID-19 caused at least 52 thousand deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day as Malawi confirmed the first COVID-19 infections, and the first associated death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that, from Thursday, it is one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced 105,135 confirmed cases, including 79332 cases during the twenty-four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European time ( 0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244 thousand cases of coronavirus were recorded in the United States, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1000 deaths in the United States were recorded on Wednesday due to a coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Mr. Sergei Subianin, Mayor of Moscow, announced the extension of the city’s lockdown period until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced the continued payment of salaries to Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was approved by 215 votes, ten abstentions, and one vote was opposed.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to become all day long; it was previously from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand intends to impose a curfews from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike D. Wayne announced that the state had extended the order to stay home until May 1.
Australia stores reduce the purchase limits of toilet paper per transaction
The Australian Walworths and Coles chain of stores on Saturday and Sunday evening tightened restrictions on buying toilet paper to reduce it to two rolls of Walworths and one roll of Coles for each transaction in all branches nationwide.
Aldi stores also identified one roll, on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were published as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
Buyers have reportedly stored them due to COVID-19 concerns in case people need self-isolation.
On Wednesday, Walworth stores approved restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes becoming one roll per purchase order.
These changes followed previous restrictions approved by Wallworth stores on March 4 and Coles stores on March 5 allowing only four rolls per transaction.
In its March 8 press release, the Coles stores reported that despite the application of the four coil restrictions, “many stores still sell all their items within one hour of receiving it,” and the order was described as “unprecedented,” as well as labeled by Aldi stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as “unforeseen.”
Sales increased “significantly” in the past week, according to the Wallworth store spokesperson.
Costco’s Canberra store also last week identified that the amount allowed to be purchased is two rolls.
To ease shortages, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased delivery, and Wallworth stores requested additional inventory, while Alde stores made their inventory available for special offers scheduled for Wednesday early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions related to the timing of delivery of trucks make it difficult.
High production costs are expected, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Alde stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores would not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
In a report for News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, reported that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large-sized commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which enhances the feeling of shortage.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said: “Colles stores and Walworth stores have a point of view that [that] if there are a lot of goods on the shelves, and if [the] products such as toilet rolls and sterilizers can be purchased and supplied in large quantities, this may reduce panic.”
Who Gives a Crap, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported on Wednesday that its inventory ran out.
According to the News.com.au report, Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet wipes for Klinx, and Solaris Bieber, which produces sorpent wipes, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, noted that some real estate sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long weekend of Labor Day.
The Thursday edition of the newspaper Nt News, a daily publication in Darwin, included an eight-page advertising fold made so that it can be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3. The stores reported that they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmermann added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dried goods, handwashes, and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, Sunday evening it was observed that a British online store named Okado sets the purchase of Andres toilet paper with two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announces that COVID-19 is a pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus — is known as SARS-CoV-2 — at the level of the pandemic.
Although the word “pandemic” refers only to the extent of the disease, not to the extent of specific cases, the World Health Organization has paid attention to the need to push governments to take the necessary measures:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries discover and conduct examinations for people, treat them, isolate them, track their cases, and mobilize them to confront them,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are all very concerned by the levels of prevalence and the alarming seriousness as well as the levels of inaction that are alarming."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, this pandemic is “unprecedented.”
No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu," CNN reported in February.
We have never been exposed to a pandemic caused by one of the coronaviruses," said Geresos.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time,” he said.
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the WHO’s decision in January to declare that an outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: “To sum up, things will get worse.”
There are at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide from Thursday, and more than 4,600 deaths, according to the Associated Press.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency as an international concern on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to.08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance between people, monitoring, and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world respond to this risk by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to severe global social and economic turmoil, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and a widespread supply shortage worsened by the panic of purchase.
Schools and universities have either closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting around 99.4% of the world’s student population.
False information about the virus spread online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East and Southeast Asia, and other areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and lockdown rates for heavy industries, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province) in China reported a range of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason on December 31, 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly related to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale, so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squamous anteaters, and SARS-CoV-2.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report published by the South China morning newspaper indicated that a case dating back to November 17, 2019, aged 55 from Hubei province, was probably the first case.
There may be a significant lack of case reporting, particularly among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, a relatively small number of cases were reported among young people, with adults making up 19 and below 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and confirmed to be infected according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies related to not testing for those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China until January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of registered cases.
Statistical analysis estimates published on March 30 indicated that the number of infections in Italy was far greater than recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the primary reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged between 1.4 and 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China from 5 February were concentrated in those over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The real number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing them – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of Covid deaths recorded at a factor of 4-5x.
The CDC spokeswoman in the United States acknowledged that “we know that [the number of deaths advertised] reflects less than reality,” a statement backed by narrative reports indicating inaccuracy in the United States.
It was the first death outside mainland China on 1 February in the Philippines, and it was the first death outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China in both Iran and South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options and the time it takes since the onset of the outbreak, and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender, and public health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death toll ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, an estimated 17.3% (for those who had symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) decreased to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms after 1 February 2020).
These statistics do not have a time frame and track a specific population from injury to knowing the fate of the case.
A number of academics tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The University of Oxford Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall pandemic mortality rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The top estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test in case mortality estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary depending on the location.
The outbreak of infectious diseases that are left uncontrollable usually peaks and begins to decline afterwards when the disease does not find available hosts," said Massig Boni of Pennsylvania State University.
But it’s almost impossible to reach any logical expectation now about the timing of that.”
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan stated that it could “end by June” if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 would "be spreading perhaps for a year or two".
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of world Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical distancing and other measures “until a vaccine becomes available (possibly after 18 months or more”).
I think this coronavirus is unlikely to disappear completely,” said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University. “Because it is easily commutable,” he said. “It may turn into a seasonal disease—so that it returns every year.”
The ferocity of return will depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and may not show symptoms to people who are infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum secretion (sputum), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood puffiness, diarrhea, or glaucoma.
The CDC in the United States confines emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and glaucoma of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear.
Some people with no clinical symptoms may not have symptoms but the results of the tests confirm their infection, so specialists have advised that people who have been in contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the injury.
Chinese estimates for case ratios are asymptomatic between a few and 44%.
The usual incubation period (between one day and the onset of symptoms) is between 14 days; it is often five days.
Some details of how the disease has spread are still being researched.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during mixing or by splashing the spray when coughing, sneezing or speaking, when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without covering the mouth may result in a splashing spray from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people see that the virus may also be transmitted by spray stuck in the air for a long time, which may result while speaking.
Spraying may occur on the mouths or noses of nearby people or inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may release respiratory secretions in the form of a spray and then cause air circulation.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches his eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of spreading from stool to mouth, it is thought that the risk is limited.
The virus is more contagious within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms and during later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, suggesting that they can move before severe symptoms appear.
There are only a few reports of cases without clinically confirmed symptoms, but the unsymptomatic transition has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) confirms that despite some uncertainty about how easy the disease is to spread, one person can generally count from two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however, British authorities advise washing hands after animal contact, such as when touching other surfaces that an infected person may have touched.
The coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people who were in contact with a group of acute respiratory conditions in Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus shares all its properties with the coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, as it dissolves its protective membrane.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus meets genetically with the sex of the beta coronavirus, and falls under the sub-sex of the SARBI coronavirus (B strain) in addition to the two breeds of bat origin.
96% match at the whole genome level with other coronavirus samples in bats (Pat Cove Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses created by squamous anteater and human-generated viruses.
To date, a full-genome comparison has resulted in the discovery of a 92% share of genetic material between the coronavirus for squamous ants and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that squamous ants are the medial family of this virus.
The virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately made by the reverse transcription polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions or computed tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography (CT) indicates that computed tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computed tomography to detect COVID-19 or to be considered an initial screening for the diagnosis of the disease.”
The World Health Organization has published several SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing protocols for the first time on January 17.
The test uses the reaction of the polymerase reverse transcription (RT-PCR) series in real time.
The test can be performed on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done with a nasolabial pharyngeal swab, and a swab of the throat can also be used.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been sufficiently accurate for widespread adoption.
A serological test developed by Felix obtained accreditation for use in emergency situations in the United States in accredited laboratories only.
The imaging properties of radiation images and CT scans include people with symptoms of the disease asymmetric end opacity as blurred glass and blurred crystalline infiltration.
The Italian Society of Radiation collects an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Radiation imaging without a polymerase chain reaction is a precision measure in relation to the detection of COVID-19 due to its interference with other diseases such as adenoviral virus infection.
A major study in China compared chest CT results with polymerase chain reaction and proved that although imaging is less accurate in terms of proof of injury, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it as a screening tool in infested areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiographs and computed tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and then getting rid of it by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those who already carry the infection are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.
However, the virus has reached the proliferation phase in the entire community in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected with it. Healthcare providers, who take care of a potentially infected person, are advised to use the necessary measures, precautions for mixing and eye protection.
Governments’ use of mobile location data for tracking has raised concerns about privacy, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding the restriction of such kind of surveillance.
Many mobile apps are designed or offered for volunteer use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
There is not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to produce a vaccine.
It is advisable to wash hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because home soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommended the use of a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected using various disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the surface of stainless steel), including; ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100% sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopovidone 0.2–7.5%.
Other disinfectants, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when a person is suspected of COVID or confirmed to be infected in an office or care facility, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATMs used by the patient must be sanitized.
Health organizations recommended people to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing either by bending the elbow and placing it in front of the mouth and nose or by using a tissue and getting rid of any wipes immediately.
Those who are likely to be infected with medical masks are recommended, as wearing a mask reduces the size of the respiratory spray and the distance it travels when splashed due to speaking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued instructions on timing and how to use masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “wearing a mask can reduce [people]’s desire to touch their face, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned.”
The World Health Organization has recommended that health professionals not wear masks unless they are at high risk of injury, such as those taking care of COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The CDC in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical fabric face mask.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned the exit to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government obliged everyone who enters a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded train passengers and intercity buses wear masks on April 1.
Panama made wearing a face mask when going out necessary, with the recommendation also to manufacture face masks at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing the confusion between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, sharing contactless greetings, and physically distancing from others.
Many governments are currently imposing or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if COVID-19 has not been detected in the region) to 50 people and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious diseases and complications and the CDC advised them to stay home as much as possible in outbreak areas between communities.
The use of the term “social distancing” has led to suggesting that people have to engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to communicate with others through alternative means.
This includes recommendations not to have sex except with someone you live with who is not a carrier of the virus or who has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Several governments have imposed or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those of the most vulnerable.
Those who have been in contact with a person with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region where infection is widely transmitted have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling outbreaks are containment or braking and limiting the spread.
The containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate the infected people as well as introduce other measures to combat infection and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When containment of the spread of the disease is not possible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done both at the same time.
Braking requires stricter measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the number of primary breeding to less than 1. Part of the infectious disease outbreak management tries to reduce the peak of the pandemic, in what is known as flattening the curve of the pandemic.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, mask wearing, and self-sanitary; community-based measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and canceling major gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screenings and local quarantine, and has issued alerts on the movements of the injured.
Singapore has provided financial support to injured people who have isolated themselves and imposed significant fines on those who have not done so.
Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing the spread of the pandemic rather than stopping it) and braking (reverse to the growth of the pandemic) are facing significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce the peak demand for healthcare by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and strains of health systems.
Braking may be preferred but should be maintained as long as the virus is spreading in humans (or until the vaccine is available, if this happens first), as the transition on the other hand bounces quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to curb the pandemic causes socio-economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications and drinking fluids and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, IV fluids and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may aggravate the results.
Many pre-approved vehicles are screened for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” could provide relief for the symptoms caused by SARS COVID-19.
Increased capacity and conditioning of health care centers to provide COVID-19 patient needs by the World Health Organization are described as essential measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the elimination of optional measures as possible, the separation and isolation of people with COVID-19, and the increased capacity of intensive care through staff training and increasing the number of ventilators and beds available.
There are multiple theories on where the first case originated (the so-called patient is zero).
The first known coronavirus case may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly related to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale, which also sells live animals, and one theory says the virus came from one of these types of animals; or in other words, it has an animal origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of "Coronavirus is similar to SARS".
Police have alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, to spread false rumours, and another doctor, Ivin, was reprimanded by her chiefs to arouse warning.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a general notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, prompting the investigation to begin in early January.

In January and February 2020, during the height of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. India’s lockdown has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive salaries through daily wages) unemployed. An Angus Red Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit plan.
France and Britain have adopted the German Short-Term Action Compensation Plan.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply impacted by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals—workers and freelancers—globally.
Arts and culture sector institutions have sought to support their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, around the world and with varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions have been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events, performances, or postponement.
In response, there have been extensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian repentance season in Lent.
Many Christian dioceses recommended older people to stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches made church services available via radio, live broadcasts via the Internet or television while others offered worship without leaving their cars.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Rome of its churches and chapels, and the removal of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished the services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogue temples, and Gordoara.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
This pandemic has caused the greatest disruption to the World Sports Calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the Champions League 2019-20, the Premier League 2019-20, the European League 2020, the NBA season 2019-20, and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics plans, which were scheduled to begin at the end of July, and the IOC announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than summer 2021".
This has led many gamblers to move on to play online, as many online gambling sites have reported significant increases in new subscription rates.
Many large theatres such as those in Broadway have suspended all the shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcasts or creating online “celebrations” for artists to perform, distribute, and publish their works.
The Internet has spread many online memes from the Coronavirus, as many have turned into humor and entertainment in light of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, severe prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotbeds in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports issued in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiments expressed by different groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserve the virus or received allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in the affected areas of the virus.
Following the spread of the outbreak in new hotspots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may be subject to skepticism and xenophobia.
In Japan, ChineseDontComeToJapan’s hashtag releases Twitter.
The Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and the US have reported rising levels of racist violations, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” a term that critics have considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from Northeast India, which shares the border with China, studying in major Indian cities, faced harassment due to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why the Lord retaliated them."
In China, the pandemic has led to an increase in xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, where foreigners have been described as “foreign rubbish” and targeted to “get rid of them.”
Many newspapers have removed subscription-driven pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the outbreak for open access.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory test for 2019 respiratory coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include ways to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that produce in response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, as it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and is only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 DNA.
Used to confirm very recent or active cases.
Antibody detection (serology) is used to diagnose and monitor populations.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were so simple to report or who had no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.
Due to the limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data about the spread of the virus among its residents.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant variation in the number of tests carried out by different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the RRT-PCR reaction, the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including the nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
It is not based on RT-PCR, which is performed using throat swabs only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat afterward while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For people who get tested in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken with a suction catheter or a cough substance (sputum).
One early PCR test was created in Berlin in January 2020 using the Instant Reversible Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech has also created a SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus) detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributed its own diagnostic panel for the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-2019) based on the real-time RT-PCR based on public health laboratories through the International Detection Material Supply Authority.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and one of the test stages was delayed from others at the CDC in Atlanta; this led to the successful completion of a test of less than 100 samples per day on average throughout the entire month of February 2020.
The tests using two components of trust until February 28, 2020, were not until then allowed for government and local laboratories to start the tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under the Emergency Use Authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began conducting tests in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing across the country depending on RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has enabled COVID-19 testing across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research has created and produced COVID-19 testing.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Service for Health Control registered the test. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, the FDA approved a test that can be done within 3.5 hours over large numbers, allowing one machine to conduct nearly 4128 tests 24 hours a day.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization (EWA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the Abbott m2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration previously granted a similar authorization to Holjik, Lab Corp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sefid obtained a similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses equal-temperature DNA amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects increased manufacturing to conduct 50,000 tests a day.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that “thoracic radial images have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be evident even before symptoms appear.”
The usual characteristics that appear in computerized tomography include diodes of double-sided multi-lobed glass with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
The spread develops under the pleura, irregular patches appear, and intensifies as the disease progresses.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR and CT with the origin of the current pandemic indicated that computed tomography is more sensitive than PCR, although it is less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with cases of pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends “not to use computed tomography to detect COVID-19 or to be considered a preliminary screening for the diagnosis of the disease.”
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect injury to individuals within a period starting from 7 days or after the onset of symptoms, to determine the ability of immunity, and in the case of population monitoring.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although consecutive samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For a clinical point of care test, a single blood sample is usually drawn by perforating the skin.
Contrary to the PCR methods, the recovery step is not required prior to the examination. On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration identified 29 bodies that provided notice to the Agency in accordance with the requirements. Therefore, these bodies are able to distribute their antibody tests.
In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European accreditations for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test accomplishes several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.
Hong Kong has developed a plan by which suspected patients can stay in their homes, “the emergency department gives a sample tube to patients,” spit into the tube, and return it back to get the test result after a simple period. The British National Health Service has announced that it is trying a plan to test suspected cases at home, thus excluding the risk of transmission from infected people when they come to the hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians on March 2 expressed that it was able to conduct about 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and had 10,700 people tested last week.
Health insurance is borne costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, in-car virus detection tests were available in many major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was not known, as it was only announced the results of positive cases.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from the 12/2020 calendar week, at least 483,295 samples underwent testing until the end of the 12/2020 week, and the results of 33,491 samples (6.9%) positive were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital devised a method of examining samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and subjected that method to testing, by collecting samples and not conducting further tests unless the sample is found to be positive.
With Wang Jian, founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do so, modeling operations showed that cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would double if those testing capability was not completed.
Wuhan laboratory has immediately followed the establishment of Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai and in 12 cities in total throughout China.
By March 4, 2020, daily gross productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1122 samples for a patient to detect COVID-19 using only 93 tests.
In March, the shortage and insufficient exposure caused a dilemma when conducting a large number of tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that include sample heating at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing.
This was through a combination of in-car testing capability activation, and the purchase of a highly productive population-friendly laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory was established within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RT-BCR tests to be performed daily and is the world’s first laboratory of this size operating outside China.
Various methods of testing have been devised targeting different parts of the genetic features of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German Plan for the Industry of Crews, which is sent to low-income and resource-free countries to innovate their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, delaying tests available in the United States.
In contrast, experts have stated that South Korea’s abundant testing has helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced its testing capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the intensification of testing programs as the best solution to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, “defects” were found in CDC testing kits; the government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented testing in particular. Spain purchased test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results were inaccurate.
The company explained that incorrect results may be due to failure to collect samples or not to use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will reverse the purchase of kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy.
Prime Minister Matović proposed to throw it into the Danube. Professor H. Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a “high error rate” and had “prevented their use.”
The tests, followed by a quarantine for those who tested positive and followed by those who did not have SARS-CoV-2, yield positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which witnessed the first death of COVID-19 in Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 twice, and this took about ten days each time.
Almost half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all cases discovered were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new injuries were completely eliminated.
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decline in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without strict restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail facilities, through strict contact tracing and restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun to urge residents to stay in their homes on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holiday.
Several other countries have also taken control of this pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent lockdown decisions, as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries with more tests, compared to the number of deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries were able to detect only those with mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends countries that do not have the ability to conduct tests or have local, limited-experienced laboratories on COVID-19 to send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO accredited laboratories to confirm the test.
Among the 16 accredited laboratories, there are 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "positive % of tests" column is affected by the state's policy in conducting the test.
The country testing people transferred to the hospital will only have more positive cases than the country testing all its residents, whether they have symptoms or not, as other factors.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of hand cleaning for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing your hands with soap at certain "essential times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as flu or cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses or mouths (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five important moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's back or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating, before preparing food or dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry, and after.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diapers for a child or cleaning it after using it for the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching animals, feeds, or droppings.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is disinfecting hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for people dealing with food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important measure for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing infectious diseases that cause diarrhea, and reducing respiratory infections.
Reduce infant mortality at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved handwashing practices may lead to minor improvements in the growth of height in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, respiratory and diarrhoea-related child mortality rates can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by approximately 50%.
Measures that encourage hand washing from diarrhea attacks can reduce by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Washing your hands with soap is the only most effective and costly way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARE) when applying spontaneous behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major acute respiratory infections, is the first cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an inherent habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (water, sanitation and hygiene) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing has a simple detrimental effect that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to its dryness.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of scaling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Hand washing is also more often seen than it should be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five moments necessary during the day in which washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral rectum: after using the bathroom (wetting, defecation), after cleaning the baby's back (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating, before/after preparing food or dealing with raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent the transmission of the disease, including before or after the treatment of cuttings, wounds, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal waste, and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap decreases.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent, the United States approached the center with the lowest rate of 23 percent, and in China with the lowest rate of 23 percent.
The ‘Basic Health Care Program’ implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines is an example of taking action at scale to promote children’s health and education.
The treatment of worms is at twice a year, in addition to washing daily hands with soap, and cleaning daily with fluoride, at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergents to the water promotes the removal of microorganisms from the skin.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstructions of decay, increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective antiseptic to the skin because fats and proteins, which are organic soil components, do not easily decompose in water.
However, the flow of an appropriate amount of water helps to disinfect..
Hard soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies have concluded that the transition is unlikely because the bacteria are washed off with foam.
The CDC still states that "it is preferable to use liquid soap from touchless devices to pump soap."
Anti-bacterial soap is highly promoted to health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or sanitizers is selected to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of breeds of living organisms.
Therefore, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as marketed.
Besides the surfactant and the skin protection factor, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a acidity regulator, antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin moisturizers (aloe, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Oregon University School of Public Health noted that ordinary soap is as effective as the anti-bacterial soap that contains triclosan in preventing and removing diseases of bacteria from the hands.
Hot water suitable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
Disinfectant or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based for hand cleaning.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleansers (also known as an alcohol-based hand wash, disinfectant hand wash or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer acrylic acid) in a gel, moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and reduce the effect of dehydration caused by alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity.
Alcoholic sterilizers by rubbing eliminate bacterium, multi-drug-resistant bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus), tuberculosis, certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory syncytial virus, nasal viruses, husk, flu, hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol sterilizers containing 70% alcohol by rubbing spend 99.97% (a logarithmic decrease of 3.5, similar to a dB decrease of 35) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after being placed and 99.99% to 99.99% (a logarithmic decrease of 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after being placed.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection.
The front and back of the hands are rubbed between all fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a hand sanitizer scrub, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, it should only be an alternative to washing the right hands if soap and water are not available.
Repeated use of alcoholic hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients, skin moisturizers, or both are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol on dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerol or other emollients or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcoholic hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less irritation and dryness to the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, alcohol hypersensitivity, or additives in alcohol handwashes rarely occur.
Reduced susceptibility to irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor of attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not disinfect hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of the alcohol-free hand sanitizer is highly dependent on the ingredients and composition, and historically its effect has been significantly lower than that of alcohol which is based on rubbing alcohol.
Recently, formulas that use benzalkonium chloride have a cumulative and continuous effect as an antimicrobial after use, unlike alcohol that has been proven to be low after repeated use, possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, such as soap, is also an antiseptic agent because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommended using ash or sand as a substitute for soap when it is not available.
The correct hand washing method recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing ponds may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make a foam on your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands thoroughly when using soap instead of just water.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes rubbing for longer periods of germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinsing your hands inside the sink may lead to re-contamination.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent dry hands. Dry skin can damage it, which can increase the risk of transmission.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water or soap is not available or both, such as pouring water from a hanging pot or percussion with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary.
Tipby tap is a simple technique that uses a rope-hung jug, and a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium on the manufacture of paper towels, to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and newer jet air hand dryers.
After washing the hands and drying them with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the inside of the fingers by 194% and on the palm of the hand by 254%.
Drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the inside of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing the hands and drying them with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the inside of the fingers decreased by up to 76% and the palm of the hand by 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there is a possibility of infection for other water cycle users and the water cycle environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes the air out of the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and the device, and the infection may be transmitted to other water cycle users and the water cycle environment up to 2 meters away.
Using a warm air dryer spreads microorganisms 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated the different ways of drying hands.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria after drying the hands:
There are many manufacturers of various hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Handwashing with hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative while traveling due to lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing has become mandatory for a long time after Hungarian doctor Agnats Simlvis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found low incidence rates using them.
Washing medical hands will be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rubbing every part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers intertwined.
If there are droppings under the fingernails, a brush with coarse hair can be used to remove them.
Since germs may remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands at the place of health care is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transfer.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that not washing hands is still at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, conveying microorganisms.
One study showed that properly washing hands and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a newspaper explaining the way hand washing and rubbing them in health care sectors.
The hand hygiene guidance document project provided by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has “five moments” to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before the task of sterilizing, and
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") gives an exterminating ingredient to the handwashing agent.
This extermination component may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant objects are heavily spread. When “rubbing” someone’s hands for surgery, a tap that can be turned on and off without touching them with hands is required. Some chlorinehexidine or iodine lotions, sterile hand drying towels after washing, a sterile scrubbing brush, and another sterile nail cleaning tool are also needed.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, you should prevent rebounding from the forearms to the hands.
After hand washing is done, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control hospital staphylococcus infection, the biggest benefit of manual cleansing was found to be from the first 20% of washing, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to more than 35%.
Washing with regular soap more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol handwashes to reduce the H1N1 type A virus and stubborn cloning spores than hands.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is the most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, there is a handover that washing hands with soap is an essential tool at a reasonable cost to achieve good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find handwashing taps near each private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be caused by inherent habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting hand washing with soap and calling for it can affect political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and change the behavior of the population in the long run.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that societal approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in middle-income countries from the lower bracket, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star to the ultimate three stars.
Building handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness raising campaigns that are trying to achieve a change in behavior.
A few studies have considered the effectiveness of the total cost of handwashing in developing countries and their relationship to the years of life adjusted by disability.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
First recognized the importance of hand washing for human health – especially for people experiencing critical conditions such as mothers who were just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals – in the middle of the 19th century two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian physician Agnats Simlwis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and English physician Florence Nightingale, founder of modern nursing.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was due to unpleasant odors called Miyazaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and healthcare-related infections prompted US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more effectively as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing "the right ways to wash hands" were suspended next to the hand wash basins in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
Washing hands from” means something that one does not want to take responsibility for or participate in collusion with.
It stems from a paragraph in the Bible in the time when the Pontius Pilate washed his hands from Jesus Christ’s crucified decision, but it has become a phrase that has a much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth's play, Mrs. Macbeth begins to overwash her hands in an attempt to cleanse a fantasy-making spot that represents her guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes her husband has urged her to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about immoral work, tend to wash hands more than others, and tend to value hand washing tools more.
Moreover, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other “purifying” reparations, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of the ritual of hand washing that has appeared in many religions, including the Bahá’í, Hindu, and Tevilah doctrine, hand washing in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and getting ill in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing before and after each meal.
COVID-19 Risk Controls in the Workplace
COVID-19 risk controls in the workplace are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control controls to prevent COVID-19 2019.
The right controls for workplace risk control depend on the job site and job task, based on the assessment of the risk of exposure, the risk of disease in the community, and risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other co-workers, a situation in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, taking into account the etiquette of coughing and sneezing, and maintaining normal practices to clean and disinfect the work environment.
Jobs with moderate risk of exposure include those that require frequent communication, close proximity to unknown individuals, or suspected COVID-19, but may be infected due to the ongoing transmission of infection in the community or international travel.
This includes workers who have communicated with public audiences as in schools, high labor-intensive work environments, and some large-scale retail spaces.
Risk controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, sneezing prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
Occupational safety and health management (OSH) are health care workers and the purse of dead bodies who are exposed to a person known to COVID-19 or a suspect who is at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure if workers carry out aerosol generation procedures, or collect or deal with samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Appropriate risk control controls for these employees include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and PPE equipment suitable for the job.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have multiple impacts in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or for fear of potential exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of both the quality of the goods ordered, and the ways to obtain them (such as shopping on non-peak hours or via delivery or shopping services without leaving the car).
Finally, shipments of goods from heavily affected geographic areas may stop with COVID-19.
The plans address the levels of risks associated with different workplaces and job functions, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as older age or chronic medical conditions.
It also identifies the necessary controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infections may be subject to national and sub-national recommendations.
The objectives of the outbreak response include reducing transmission between employees, protecting people at higher risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business processes, and minimizing the negative impact on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the responses taken.
The risk control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used in the field of occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls according to effectiveness.
As COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implementation.
Administrative controls are changes in the employment policy or procedures that require an action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to the worker, correct fit as appropriate (such as respirators), wear continuously and properly, and regularly inspect, maintain and replace, as necessary, remove, clean and store, or properly dispose of for the avoidance of contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that include a lower risk exposure involve minimal communication with the public and other co-workers.
Essential infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and complete hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account the etiquette of coughing and sneezing including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper towels and garbage containers, preparing for remote work or organizing shifts of work if necessary, excluding workers from using other tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with severe respiratory symptoms remain at home until fever, fever signs and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-lowering drugs or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies are flexible, that employees are allowed to stay at home to take care of a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Department, jobs with a moderate risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or close communication within a six-foot distance (1.8 m) of individuals unknown or suspected of COVID-19, but they may develop SARS-CoV-2 due to the ongoing transmission of infection in the community surrounding the workplace, or due to a recent international travel procedure to a COVID-19 transmission site.
This includes workers who engage with public audiences such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some large-scale retail spaces. Engineering controls for this and higher-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. These include administrative controls, high-risk groups encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual connections, establishing successively organized shifts, stopping unnecessary travel to sites where there are ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19, developing emergency communication plans including a forum to respond to worker concerns, providing workers with up-to-to-date education and training on risk factors and protective behaviors related to COVID-19, providing resources and work environment that induce personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting the arrival of customers and public hands to work site, and posting signs of hand washing and other COVID-19 prevention measures. Based on the job task, workers at least average exposure to wear, workers may need to wear personal protective protective protective protective equipment including a range of protective glove, face glasses, face, face, face, face masks, and eyewear, mask.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use respirators.
If the person becomes sick and is on a plane, appropriate protective controls for protecting workers and other passengers include removing the sick passenger from others by a distance of 6 feet, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger, touching body fluids or contaminated surfaces, and may use additional personal protective equipment if the passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk control controls include an illness travel delay, self-isolation and notification to the on-board medical center immediately if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is located in the school building regardless of the spread in the community.
When there is a limit on transmission in the community ranging from limited to medium, social distancing strategies such as cancellation of field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, music band classes, or eating meals in the canteen, increasing distances between offices, organizing successive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms can be implemented.
When there is a significant transmission in the community, as well as social distancing strategies, extending school departure times can be considered.
Law enforcement officials who must contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as medical emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect work belts and tools before re-use using a home cleaning spray or wiper, and follow the unified work procedures to deal with pollution and get rid of the personal protective equipment used and to collect and wash clothes.
Occupational safety and health management believes that some health care workers and the purse of dead bodies fall into categories with high or very high risk levels.
Jobs with a high level of risk include health care workers, support, laboratories, and medical transport who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are at a very high level of risk if aerosol generation procedures are performed by workers, as well as samples from confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are collected or handled.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or the collection of invading specimens.
The functions of the dead’s high-risk purse include workers who are involved in preparing the bodies of confirmed or suspected people with COVID-19 at the time of their death; these are at a very high level of risk if they carry out an autopsy.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care places and to preserve the bodies of the dead.
Samples must be handled following Level 3 Biological Safety Precautions.
In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working at a distance of 6 feet from known or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95-type filtered face mask respirators, approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation and suitability testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improved comfort for workers.
The World Health Organization only recommends the use of a surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, take care of them, or transport them without any aerosol generation procedures, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, goggles, face shields, and squash and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 breathing mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine and physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the same breath mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and refraining from using masks for symptomless individuals.

Theme line: [COVID 19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
Transmission date/time: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in exceptional circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a sign of global humanitarian interdependence and the responsibilities we have with others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know that the best response is based on a kind of global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are firmly at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care that we have seen among all our colleagues via emails, calls and conversations is an amazing practical proof of the amazing human feelings that happily surround our business.
I am deeply grateful and proud of being a true colleague.
Last week, someone sent me a message to express their appreciation for our business.
It reminds me of how important the world is to go towards Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism that this critical resource remains available online and accessible to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it is through the continued work of the sites, our colleagues receiving salaries, or providing safety to our communities.
The world is in dire need of information on Wikipedia than ever before.
It is a moment when the positive impact in the world is not limited to our efforts, but to the way we do it as well.
Because of the importance of this task and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments to how we work together starting next week.
Adjustments to work mode and schedules
As Robin previously mentioned, the team met yesterday to discuss our way and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that discussion, we looked at what we saw could be the right response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to sustain the organization’s business during this period.
We have been very enthusiastically wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and to support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that’s fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working period is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We’re not going to announce a holiday, and if you’re able to work longer than your usual working hours, you might add your efforts to the job.
However, the world is currently unpredictable, and whether you want to care for your loved ones, get groceries or go to a doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don’t track your times.
If you are sick, don't work.
Allowing this should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it as a confirmation.
No paid or sick leave is required. Simply inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If your doctor diagnoses COVID-19 as a positive diagnosis, please let Bryan know in the Training and Certification Operations Department so that the Training and Certification Department can assist with support and ensure that you receive appropriate care from the Department).
Colleagues working at the clock receive their full wages.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this pledge of our commitments to our contractors and our colleagues working at the clock.
Every employee will receive their wages based on the usual working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether an employee is sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people take advantage of the work to overcome the rampant pressures in the world around us.
What we can do will be amazingly productive, especially during such stressful times.
Again, it is about caring for the person for himself.
We only solicit from you to communicate with your manager so that he can find out what to expect and adjust the procedures to adapt accordingly.
Some work is essential.
There are also some things that we must keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR operations, trust, honesty, fundraising (and others) are doing a critical work, which may need more support.
We will start a process in collaboration with all departments to assess the current goals and turn our focus into supporting the necessary elements to achieve our mission.
There is a lot of work that we all should do, and we will focus on only the most important projects.
Moving slower now will not hurt us later.
We don’t plan to “double the working time to overtake what’s missed” after the pandemic ends.
We are not expected to work extra hours to meet the currently unrealistic deadlines.
We accept the fact that these circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and timelines whenever it becomes appropriate.
What happens in annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule of our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We intend to extend our 2019-2020 plan allowing for more time to design budget to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and caring for loved ones while reconciling situations who need to work on a reduced working hours schedule or want to, over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension relieves the current planning workloads and pressure across the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will inform delegates and teams about the next steps as soon as confirmation is received.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues working in San Francisco may have been infected with COVID-19.
However, from precaution and an adult ban, we have hired a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team may use a class antivirus solution used in hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its due diligence protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable because the office is properly ready until the time when we decide to return to work.
Our office in Washington D.C. is located in a WeWork building, which we have participated in its COVID-19 protocol and with all members of the staff at our Washington D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our office in Washington D.C. moved to a fully remote location under the joint directive with our office in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues know at our New York City headquarters, we’ve had a discussion on renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our long-term remote colleagues know that it may be an adjustment, and they’d like to give you some advice:
Meeting time should be set for a maximum of 1 hour or a gradual increase of up to 2 hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, set up an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Video should make the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate direct collaboration and communication.
Take action by facilitating each meeting, by taking over the conversation person to learn questions and track the list of speakers, and by someone else to help take notes (or carry out a collaborative note-taking process).
You should send an email to technical support when you need comfortable headphones.
The health and safety compensation program can be used to obtain the cost of snacks.
#remoties channel can be joined in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking for guidance on user-friendly elements based on online meetings, to support the increase in distributed business across our organization.
Over the past week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as online site editors’ events Editathon, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
Tell them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities, and that no person will be charged fines for delaying or amending these goals.
Next week, we will release additional follow-up guidance on Wikimedia and other regional and topical community conferences.
The general feelings that prevail in the global community are fraught with turmoil, the comfort of clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Moving forward with these actions, the crisis response team is designing a page on Metawiki to provide space for the community to monitor impact and follow up on all communications with it.
Stay on top of COVID-19 related topics
We'll send a call to your calendar next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 EDT for the staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer questions, and spend time communicating with us.
We go through this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to get information from this email, and all other necessary COVID-19 information available at Office Wiki.
The crisis response team will keep these pages up to date and keep all information in one place.
We are also working on the continuation of regular communications with workers residing in highly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key areas of work, coverage challenges, or anything else you need help with, please don’t hesitate to let us know and collaborate with our crisis response team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Brian Gooden, Director of International Human Resources Global Operations.
No change in these changes shall be deemed to be a waiver of the work entrusted to us or of the obligations that fall upon us.
Instead, it is a realization at the present moment that our work and commitments are in a critical need to adapt to the situation in a way that we have not entrusted in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work and provide our employees with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The actions we planned to achieve will be waiting for us when it comes time to complete them.
Now, it’s time for everyone to help the other and create a space for the important work that comes in the coming weeks and months to come.
We need you all to achieve this, so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when the time has come.
Please now wash your hands and do not touch the face!
Catherine, Crisis Response Team Manager (Amanda K, Ami V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Linette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other members of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, kidney, as well as intestines.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 counteracts the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as haCE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is known as a metallic enzyme that contains a zinc element and is located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
Angiotensin2-converting enzyme protein has a Peptides-M2-wide range that has an amino tip, and a carboxylic cholectrinic chain that is a carrier of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1, single-pass membranous protein that has active enzymatic receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular part of the ACE2 cell range is separated from the transmembranous range by an enzyme called shedaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then out through urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, and in the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the cells of the muscles smooth with artery walls in most organs.
The messenger RNA of the ACE2 is present in the cerebral cortex, the schema, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a balancer of ACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of the hormone angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 astringent of blood vessels.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 separates the carboxylic tip containing the amino acid phenylalanine from the angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-histiden-proline-phenylalanine) and analyzes it to convert it to angiotensin (1-7), (histiden-aspartite-arginine-valine-tyrosine-isoleucine-hestin-hestin-proline-phenylalanine).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 separates into a number of other peptides, including Dis-Arginine9 -Pradrykinin, Applin, Neurotensin, Dynorphine A, and Gerlin.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19, and also has a role in Hartenposis.
Angiotensin 2, as a transmembranous protein, is the main entrance to cells of certain coronaviruses, which include the human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS infection), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the association of the spike protein S1 to SARS-CoV-2 with the enzyme-converting angiotensin 2 range on the surface of cells leads to cellular affinity and the transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles that fall into the cells.
This input process needs to prepare the S protein by transmembrane protease enzyme, serine2 of the host, which is still being inhibited as a potential treatment.
In any case, many specialized associations and self-regulatory bodies recommend continuing to use the usual ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 explained that the use of ACE inhibitors was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.
Moreover, “pneumonia risk has decreased among those who received treatment for ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with a stroke or heart failure.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in the number of deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less potent compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 (rhACE2) enzyme is thought to be a new treatment for acute lung injuries. It has been found to improve the process of pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory syndrome induced by polysaccharides.
Angiotensin 2 is approximately 10 hours old, while it starts after 30 minutes, in addition to its continued effectiveness (time period) up to 24 hours.
There are many indications that angiotensin 2 recombinant enzyme may be a promising treatment for those with traditional angiotensin intolerance (RAS inhibitors), and for diseases accompanied by a rise in angiotensin 2 in the blood.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software apps specifically designed to help track people in contact in response to the 2019-20 COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the identification process of people (“Contactors”) who may be in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed to design applications to track contacts.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that rely on geolocation tracking for app users.
Less intrusive alternatives to privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced together that they may integrate a function that supports these Bluetooth-based applications, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government in collaboration with Alipay has published an app that allows citizens to check whether they have engaged people with COVID-19 or not.
Rate this App It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities.
North Macedonia has launched StopKorona, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to contact potential infected individuals and provide rapid response to health care authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for the Google Play Store and the App Store to be certified by Apple.
On April 12, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in the advanced development phase and may become available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France are planning to launch a similar app, which is ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing apps based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app, as well as the Blue Tres protocol. Russia intends to launch an app that uses the geographic virtual perimeter for patients who doctors diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow residents, and is designed to make sure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of possible practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including pseudo-positive cases and potential lack of effectiveness if the use of applications is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misguided or harmful coronavirus apps, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations whose coronavirus-related apps can add to its app store, limiting it to only “formal” or other reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of COVID-19 applications, especially as the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic will disappear immediately after the threat ends.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring extensions should include items related to when to stop them;
The use of data should be limited to COVID-19-related purposes;
Data security and identity confidentiality should be protected and proven based on evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be determined by law;
Abuse protections and the protection of citizens’ rights should be available to address abuse;
Active Participation” is required from all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the issue of ongoing monitoring by removing tracking mechanism from device operating systems as soon as they are no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, network-based tracking administrators relied.
But networking-based solutions that have access to sites’ metadata have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with centralized servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems that only use central servers for intercoms (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials have used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a custom app, the system collects tracking information from different sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and includes this data to send notifications via text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made website information publicly available as well, which it has allowed due to widespread changes in information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites.
On April 6, 2020, the details on this issue have not yet been released.
On April 7, 2020, more than dozens of groups of experts worked on accessing privacy-friendly solutions, such as low-energy Bluetooth (PLE), to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BP-BT was a coordinating effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include tracking decentralized approach to privacy (DB-BT/DB-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as contact event numbers, CNN), sensitive privacy protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (BACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data does not leave the device, and all matching operations occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab’s privacy group was developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting location data or cross-tracking and leveraging them to track the spread of COVID-19.
The SafeTrace platform for Enigma MPC, a developer of privacy-related technologies that originally originated in MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure device technologies to allow users to share sensitive site and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Numbers Coalition was established by groups of interest around what was essentially a similar approach and protocols that overlapped heavily, whose goal was to reduce dispersion and enable global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature of widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the Blue Tris protocol, which the official government application uses, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control mobile operating systems Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts, claiming that they will maintain privacy based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to introduce the system in three stages:
Introducing tools to enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to track COVID-19
Integrate this function directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to resolve ongoing usage and monitoring issues by distributing systems first through OS updates and then removing them in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Repositioning the drug (also known as re-use, re-allocation, goal change or therapeutic transformation of the drug) is to redefine the use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than originally designed to treat it.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of plasma. The SARS-CoV-2 virus contains approximately 66 drug-treated proteins, each of which has multiple linked sites.
The analysis of these sites provides the reasonable plan for the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the proteins targeted at SARS-CoV-2 are the semi-door protease, the RNA polymerase based on RNA, Helicase, S-protein, and the adenosine biphosphate ribophosphatase.
Hussein A and others have studied several candidate compounds that have then been improved and analyzed similar to their structure with higher-like approved drugs for the purpose of accelerating the development of a powerful anti-SARSCoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is a malaria medication that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, a global health organization announced that the associated chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine could be among four drugs studied as part of the clinical solidarity experience.
New York Governor Andrew Como announced that New York State’s experiments on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may begin on March 24. On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of chloroquine hydroxysulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (EUA).
Treatment is not approved by the FDA’s clinical trial process and licensed under emergency use authorization only as an experimental emergency use treatment for patients who have entered the hospital but cannot receive treatment in the clinical trial.
The CDC announced that it has not yet identified “the use of hydroxychloroquine to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, doses or period.”
The doctors said they were using the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorin in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Great studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
New York University’s Langon School of Medicine conducts an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of hydrochloroquine preventive use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen test results were negative at an average of 4 days, while the disease period was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given Favipiravir and the other half received Omiphenovir.
The Italian Drug Agency has alerted people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the property from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and the military would use to deliver the property to university hospitals, where the property would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China morning newspaper, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the property. The drug may be less effective in treating more severe cases as the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women who want to get pregnant.
One study using lobinavir/ritonavir (Calitara), a combination of lobinavir and ritonavir, has reported that the results “have not detected any benefit”.
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from copying by binding it to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to reach a compound linked to the SARS-CoV-2 Protease.
WHO has added Lubinavir/Retonavir in the international solidarity experience.
Gilead Sciences has developed remdesifer drug as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection.
One of the problems related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that remdeserve may be characterized by a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are many current multiple clinical trials, including those conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one about moderately ill patients, and one for more severe patients.
There are three clinical trials about antiviral vitamin C on patients who have entered the hospital with severe illness due to COVID-19, as well as two controlled trials using placebo (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began experiments on the effect of antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japan National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to carry out a clinical trial on the use of Alvesko (Ceclesonide) produced by Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, to treat patients with COVID-19 before symptoms appear.
A second-stage trial using a form of angiotensin-transformer enzyme 2 is currently taking place on 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute conditions that entered the hospital in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, which bears the name of Col Corona, includes 6000 adults who are 40 years old and older, who doctors diagnosed with COVID-19 and have experienced mild symptoms without the need to enter the hospital.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible for this.
Many anticoagulants are also tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, requiring the Italian Drug Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multi-centre study in Italy was announced on 300 patients to research the use of sodium inoxaprine in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a significant scientific focus is on reusing approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with previous outbreaks such as the March, the SARS, and the West Nile virus.
Repavirin: Specialists recommended the use of ribavirin for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of the Chinese directive
Omiphenovir: specialists recommended the use of Omiphenovir for COVID-19 treatment according to the 7th edition of the Chinese Directive
Some antibiotics that specialists have identified may be reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tsilizomap (Interloquin Antireceptor 6): Certified by China.
Experiences in Italy and China as well. See Tsilizomap#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, there are numerous ongoing attempts to develop this vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak spread in 2020, leading to significant investments and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition’s Initiative on Pandemic Preparedness Innovations for the Development of Vaccines, announced in April, are the speed, manufacturing capacity, widespread deployment and global reach.
In April, Coalition scientists on pandemic preparedness innovations reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main objectives of the platform that progressed to the first stage of safety studies include:
DNA (Oxygen Deficit DNA and RNA) (first-stage developer and filtered vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (first-stage developer and filter vaccine: Moderna, type 5) adenoviral vector
According to Coalition scientists on pandemic preparedness innovations in April, there are 115 total vaccine candidates in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to Melkin Institute), and 37 more were announced, but with little public information (presumed to be in planning or being designed).
Phase I and II trials perform an initial safety and abstinence test, usually random, overlooked, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve a greater number of participants, including the reference group, testing the efficacy of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while observing the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Out of 79 vaccine candidates under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under clinical "preclinical" research).
On almost January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would alter viral proteins genetically in order to trigger an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, targeting the start of tests in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On almost 29 January 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanyke Schumitmaker, announced that they had begun working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is involved in the development of an oral vaccine with her biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a study on the design of a vaccine with technology similar to that used in the treatment of cancer with the new antigen vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had finished manufacturing the vaccine and that they were starting tests.
On February 27, 2020, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Generex, announced that it had begun a vaccine project to synthesis the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested in humans “within 90 days”.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Command for Medical Research and Gear at Fort Derek and the Walter Reed Military Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that they formed a team with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for Phase 1 preclinical testing and clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of work accelerated it would take at least one and a half to about two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, reported that it is developing a similar corona virus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with plans for testing in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac “significant sums of money” for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government needed.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company to participate in the development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The BNT162 vaccine, currently undergoing preclinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would get preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final candidate vaccine could start testing in humans by autumn.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research union that includes Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, pushing the total investment of the Epidemic Preparedness Innovations Alliance in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
Coalition partners on pandemic preparedness innovations to develop the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing for six different candidate vaccines.
Imperial College researchers in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-inflated RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on anti-Covid medical measures, including several candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago Initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
Nearly the same time, the Canadian government announced Canadian $192 million specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, the potential vaccine for COVID-19 in mice, stating that "the S1 subunit vaccines given to SARS-CoV-2 microneedling triggered strong responses to specific antigen antibodies [in mice] were clear starting from 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a filter vaccine based on hypo-oxygenated RNA as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the hypoxia DNA will be designed for replication within human bacteria to produce harmful particles similar to the virus, which may trigger the immune system to produce antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities compiled resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called indefinite effects.
This means that they can have benefits that go beyond the disease they are struggling with.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines being developed are likely not safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine effectiveness using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as GMO mice with ACE2, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for Level 3 biosafety measures to deal with living viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety measures.
The anti-SARS vaccines and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When March spread, existing research on SARS was thought to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the March-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East respiratory syndrome vaccine (based on minus-oxygen DNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans and three other vaccines under development, all of which were virus-orientated vaccines, two adenoviral vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-orientated vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts sparked the conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS-causing coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is contagious caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and symptoms is usually about five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus is mainly spread among people during mixing, often by splashing when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
When splashing spray during exhalation, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces instead of being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the reaction of the polymerase sequence of instantaneous reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) through a nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for suspected people who are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the general use of masks vary, as some authorities recommend not to use them, some of them see otherwise, and others are inevitable to use them.
Currently, there is no specific COVID-19 vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The transmission of the disease has been reported at the local level in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may not have symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if you develop emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or blues on the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, may be observed in varying proportions.
At first, some cases in China have only suffered from chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who have symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of disease carriers has not yet been fully identified without symptoms of transmission; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The percentage of people who are infected without symptoms is currently unknown and are under study, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KDC) reported that 20% of the total cases confirmed did not show symptoms during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began listing non-symptomatic cases in the daily toll on April 1; out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) of these cases did not show symptoms at the test.
Sputum and saliva may carry large percentages of the virus.
Loud speaking results in more spray than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore showed that coughing without covering the mouth may lead to splashing sprays at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences noted that it could be transmitted by bio-aerosols, and the examination of samples of air complexes in the lobby outside the individuals' rooms resulted in positive results for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and CPR, may cause respiratory secretions to be released as a spray, and then the virus is spread through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, it is thought that the risk is limited. The virus is more contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is less.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easy the disease is to spread, one person can generally count from two to three people.
Specifically, it is found that the virus remains on cardboard for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper 99%.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soaps and disinfectants are also effective on the condition that they are used correctly. Soaps dissolve the virus’s protective lipid membrane and stop it, in addition to ridding the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are available with less efficacy.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test appeared in the sixth patient the highest viral load.
The coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARSCoV-2) is a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people who had pneumonia within the group of acute respiratory conditions in Wuhan.
The new SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its properties with the related coronaviruses found in nature.
Beyond the body, home soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane.
The lungs are the two most affected by COVID-19 because the virus enters the host cells with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the second type of alveolar cells present in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "spike" (the fulfie voucher) to connect to the ACI2 and enter the host cell.
12% of infected people who entered the hospital in Wuhan, China, have suffered severe heart attacks, and are more common in critical cases.
Heart and blood vessel-related symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the development of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACI2 receptors in the heart.
ACI2 receptors play a very important role in the heart and participate in the performance of its functions.
The thrombocytopenia (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with COVID-19 have increased, which may be associated with poor prediction of what the condition is going to be.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards respiratory epithelial cells, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammatoryism.
In particular, T cells that secrete the disease-causing GMSF have been found to be associated with bringing the only cells that secrete interlockin 6 that cause inflammation and lung diseases that are most likely to occur in COVID-19 patients.
It was also reported that there was a lymphatic infiltration when the body was dissected.
The World Health Organization has published several disease testing protocols.
The polymerase chain reaction for instant reverse transcription (RT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually done with respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample can also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two weeks of blood sampling and results are of a simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and spread the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR tests to detect infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experience on the test showed that the accuracy is only between 60 and 70%.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month.
Frosted double-sided polylobes glass ores with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior spread are common features at the beginning of the injury.
The spread may appear under the lateral and the shape of a stone alignment (thickness of the lobular septum with an uneven sengue filling) and merge with the development of the disease.
Few data on microscopic lesions and pathological physiology are available for COVID-19.
The main pathological conclusions of the autopsy:
Microscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung enlargement and pulmonary edema
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pulmonary cell hyperplasia, nontypical large alveolar cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphatic infiltration and formation of giant multi-core cells
Acute pneumonia: DAD circulating alveolar damage with diffuse alveolar secretions.
Diffuse alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the alveoli and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Diffusion intravascular coagulation (DC); reaction of white blood cells
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of injury include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and it is recommended to use the inside of the elbow if a handkerchief is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any cough or sneeze.
CDC recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, which is partly aimed at reducing the transmission of asymptomatic infections. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
Divergence guidelines also include that people are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. As vaccine innovation is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of Covid-19 control is trying to reduce the peak of the pandemic, which is known as “a flattening of the curve.”
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains alcohol at least 60%, when not only soap and water are available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO offers two local production formulas.
Antimicrobial activity arises in these two formulations of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organ support affected.
CDC recommends that those suspected of getting the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to address the respiratory failure problem, but its benefits are still being studied.
It is recommended to take personal hygiene and rely on a healthy lifestyle and diet to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the injury.
Intensive care professionals and pulmonologists in the United States gathered treatment recommendations from diverse bodies in a free resource, an online critical case care book.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment for COVID-19 was available.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing actions that may result in spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing a person in the isolation room from airborne infection (AIR) as well as using standard precautions, mixing precautions and airborne illness precautions.
Recommended tools: PPE aprons, respirator or face mask, eye shield, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators were approved for industrial facilities, but the FDA authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields, or homemade masks as the last solution.
The most common COVID-19 cases are not as degraded as they require artificial respiration or alternatives, but some conditions need to.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with COVID-19-related respiratory failure for those in hospitals is actively studied, with some evidence of the possibility of avoiding intubation using a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive pressure of the airway.
It is not known whether either of these options is achieving the same benefit for those who suffer from a critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gas ventilators whenever they provide because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high-flowing nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, which restricts the health system’s ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 cases that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% died.
In China, nearly 30% of those transferred to hospitals due to COVID-19 eventually enter ICUs.
Respirators become more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Breathing devices need to feature high pressure and high positive end exhalation pressure controls to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of respiratory and pneumococcal lung injury.
High positive end exhalation pressure may not be available in old respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs in the clinical trial phase.
Remdecifer seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many tested drugs have already been approved for other uses or are already at an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on those with a critical condition.
The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use Convalescence Plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person’s life is seriously threatened or directly.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to prove that it is safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The application is able to detect 'contacters' using surveillance data and thus the risk of possible infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analytics for mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track and engage infected people in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track the mobile data of those supposed to be infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect those who are likely to be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy’s regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, stated that mobile phone companies informed him that “40 percent of people are still on the move everywhere.”
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon involving more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Ms. Kirsti Calliulide, has also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may be upset by quarantine, travel restrictions, or side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
Increasing social isolation, unity, health anxiety, stress and economic stagnation are a storm of people’s mental health and well-being,” BBC reported to Rory O’Connor.
The disease may take a mild course that involves mild or asymptomatic symptoms, as other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as a cold, are similar.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more susceptible to severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data on COVID-19. COVID-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
COVID-19 in the most severely affected people may quickly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting in respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of people with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with blood clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, while 4% of them were observed kidney dysfunction.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have seen a rise in liver enzyme levels (amine vectors).
According to the same report, the average period between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average period for those transferred to the intensive care unit between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In an early case study, the average period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, reaching the overall level of cases from six days to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, men’s mortality rate was 2.8%, while women’s mortality was 1.7%.
Histological anatomical examinations of lung samples after death show widespread alveolar damage with cellular fibroxide secretions in both lungs.
Viral cell disease changes are observed in the alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage due to high levels of tropone or cardiac arrest was observed in 11.8% of deaths announced by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data from the United States in March, 89% of those transferred to the hospital had previous medical conditions.
The estimated deaths resulting from the condition are different as a result of those differences between the regions, but also due to systemic difficulties.
A lack of simple cases can increase the estimation of death from truth.
However, a fact that causes pre-mortem cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than that of the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung tests indicated that there was damage to it.
This can also cause post-concentrated syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection was gaining effective and long-term immunity for recovering from the disease.
Immunization is seen as potential, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it was announced that there were cases that recovered from COVID-19 and then re-infected it later.
It is believed that these cases worsen if the infection persists more than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and has an animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was largely caused by its human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 was the first date for symptoms.
Official WHO publications report that December 8, 2019 is the first date for symptoms to appear.
Several measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These figures vary by region and over time and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, and the time taken since the onset of the outbreak and the characteristics of the population such as age, gender and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization allocated within the 10th review of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) emergency code U07.1 for confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths without laboratory confirmation.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, globally 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) deaths from injuries were reported as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the death rate of cases (CFR), which expresses the percentage of those detected and died due to illness, the rate of infection deaths (IFR), which expresses the percentage of infected people (who discovered and who did not), and those who died due to illness.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they also follow a specific population from injury to knowing the fate of the situation.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected people, their presence may provide information about the number of infected people.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione di Ada, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people have already died (1.7%).
In Ganglet, the disease has spread due to Carnival festivals, and has moved to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and perhaps not all COVID-19 deaths have been officially classified as the result of it.
Furthermore, the German health system was not exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
The death of 69 (0.0004% of the population) was confirmed by COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rate of the pandemic varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women fading at just 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent in men and 1.7 percent in women.
The exact causes of these sexual differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Immunological differences based on gender, non-proliferation of smoking among women and men with concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to a higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of men were infected and 72% died from COVID-19.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-disaggregated data for COVID-19 injuries.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have an increased risk of contracting the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease is "Covid-19".
The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Jepressos, explained that Ko is an abbreviation of the word Corona, and in an abbreviation for a virus and an abbreviation for a disease and 19 indicates the year of discovery of the outbreak for the first time: December 31, 2019.
Choose the name to avoid referring to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for the label that aims to prevent stigma.
In addition, WHO uses COVID-19 and COVID-19 expression in public data.
The disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "Coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "Coronavirus" and "Coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of COVID-19 and acute respiratory disease associated with COVID-19-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that prevent the use of sites in disease and virus names.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies release healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and respiratory parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on time, a local startup reversed its engineering and released the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation emerged regarding the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and spread quickly online.
It seems that humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral multiplication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a “solidarity experience” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that have the most promising effectiveness.
A vaccine is not available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 are used because it is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in using ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to study.
First, researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, the partial unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the partial units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on a spike-SS protein that helps the virus break into the ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is the DNA vaccines (chromic DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for vaccine innovation).
Experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for their safety and effectiveness. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway starting in April 2020.
Seven already approved treatment trials have been evaluated for malaria, including four studies related to hydrochloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed to be reused in the treatment of the new disease form most Chinese research, through nine Phase III trials on Remdecifer across several countries and scheduled to report their results by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and potential COVID-19 real estate has been conducted as of April 2020. Many of the antiviral properties present for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including remdesifer, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopenavir and lopenavir/tonavir combined with beta interferon.
There is preliminary evidence of the Remdecifer event, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for merciful use.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020, and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer-reviewed research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan Virus Research Institute notes that despite recommending a dose of one gram, the weakening of this dose is very dangerous and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use license for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory.
Further study was recommended for the effect of Netazoxanide on living organisms after proven inhibition of the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial preparation of spike protein by transmembrane 2 serine protease (TPRS2) is necessary to enter SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the future of ACE2.
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with or without azithromycin involve significant deficiencies that have prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study. Oseltamivir SARS-CoV-2 is not discouraged in the laboratory and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.
It undergoes a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe medical conditions.
In addition to using it in the Feritin test in serum to determine cytokine storms, it aims to counter such developments, which are believed to be the cause of death in some infected people.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has adopted Interlukine-6 receptor T cells therapy, based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of unresponsive cytokine syndrome for steroids that have a different cause in 2017.
To date, there is no evidence of a certain level of control that Tsilizomap is an effective treatment for cytokine production syndrome.
The method of transporting purified and concentrated antibodies produced by COVID-19-recovery immune systems is subject to those who need them to study as a non-vaccine method of negative vaccination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
Neutralizing the virus is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibody therapy can act as a defense medium against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity based on antibodies, phagocytosis, or both may be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The production of the puree serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be increased to spread it faster.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was then injured and died of COVID-19 after raising attention to the spread of the virus.
