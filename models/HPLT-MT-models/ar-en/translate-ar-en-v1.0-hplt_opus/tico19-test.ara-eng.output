The rapidly increasing cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK, which confirms that although the phase varies based on the state, the pandemic is rapidly worsening in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their readiness to increase the number of patients in need of healthcare, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia for unknown pathogens were reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent, the novel coronavirus, is now referred to as the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Corona virus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that almost 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, that is, respiratory infections with or without symptoms, and most of them recover.
In approximately 14%, the incidence of covid-19 worsened into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% suffer from a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate of patients who have been hospitalized due to COVID-19 was about 4%.
In this study, we assess the cumulative number trends of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK (UK) and compare them with those of Hubei County, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After what happened in China, COVID-19 has increasingly spread geographically and follows the dynamics of the pandemic in the rest of the world today.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the Eurosurvilens issue of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European cases of COVID-19 as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where between December 31, 2019 to this date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining the cumulative number and cumulative rate of cases of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is being updated in every country around the world, obtained from only official sources such as the Ministry of Health in countries, national and regional health bodies and the World Health Organization (WHO), daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data has been used to assess and compare trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
As a measure of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative number of intermittent cases of COVID-19 within 14 days, and then observed the normal course of COVID-19, in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
We also provided the cumulative number of reported cases from each country as of March 15, 2020 at 8:00 am, compared to the number in Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends of the cumulative number of cases of severed COVID-19 over a 14-day period in the EU/EEA countries and the UK followed those of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative number of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21, and then increased sharply around February 28, 2020.
This was often driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increase trends to the cumulative number of COVID-19 (a supplement).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
As of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have reported the total number of cases already similar to that found in Italy just three weeks ago or less.
Our results suggest that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative number of COVID-19 indicate that the pandemic is worsening at a similar speed in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, despite differing national public health responses, the potential for case definition differences in countries and different protocols to choose which patients to take the test to confirm their HIV-19, including the follow-up test.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy described the situation as approximately 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on hospital admissions and/or intensive care units are available at the EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not displayed).
However, it needs to be systematically collected to complete current monitoring data that focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed significant diversity in the availability of ICU and ICU beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds for intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 people in 2010–11).
Immunization-related modeling scenarios for healthcare capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK for the spread of pandemic-19 cases that have entered the hospital associated with the risk &gt; 90% to exceed the capacity of intensive care beds, are available in the sixth update to the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention's Rapid Risk Assessment (CDC) of COVID-19.
Since the cases collected so far in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve specific regional populations, information on cases and intensive care beds is preferred at the NUTS-2 level.
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the pandemic is rapidly worsening in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for a sustainable community transition scenario for SARS-CoV-2 and increase the number of people with COVID-19 who require health care, especially intensive care, such as in affected areas of Italy.
As outlined in the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECCDC) Rapid, Proactive and Comprehensive Approaches are key to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision-makers with sufficient time to understand and accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a limited chance that countries could step up their surveillance efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on health care.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to experience an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care over the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has killed more than 3,000 people and injured more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere, causing a humanitarian disaster.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, similar to the SARS-CoV virus, which led to thousands of people becoming ill with SARS in 2003, can also move from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower risk and mortality rate than SARS but is more prevalent among older people than young people and among men than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rapidly evolving topic of research.
We will address the basics of the disease epidemic, its causes, its virology, its diagnosis, treatment, the prognosis of the disease, and its prevention.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope this review will help understand and eliminate the disease that is a threat.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors throughout the holiday period and for many weeks after due to an outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; hence, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease was named CoV-19 (CoVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country, as well as nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and more than 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is the "#1 enemy of the public" and potentially stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 research papers on COVID-19 have been published that have included its own virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, since the first report was released on January 7, 2020, which identified the isolated virus sequence through several patients.
This review aims to summarize research progress in a new subject area that is rapidly evolving.
Whenever possible, we will seek to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another disease caused by Cove, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis as well as some pressing questions that remain on the table.
Corona viruses are usually considered to be non-lethal pathogens in humans, and have mainly caused about 15% of the 4 common colds.
However, in this century we have faced two severe human diseases, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and the disease quickly spread to many other countries at a terrifying rate of prevalence and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of the coronavirus in recorded human history.
As described in Figure 1.1, groups infected with an unknown-origin pneumonia were first reported by Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan reported the death of the first case.
Meanwhile, the epidemic has spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, suggesting that the disease could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down with all public transportation shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients were in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was the site of the start of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease has already spread across China and around 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients, confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19, provided a more updated explanation of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 has infected people of all age groups, but it has infected the age groups between 30 and 65 mainly.
Nearly half of those injured (47.7%) were 50 years old, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-COV-2 affects a greater number of men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has expanded among groups in and around Hubei primarily.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from the onset of the infection to the diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time of infection from its onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base breeding number (base breeding number) was 3.77 (the trust range is 95%: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted base breeding number was 2.23-4.82.
The number of injured has increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, in line with the many travel operations ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The death rate among confirmed patients was 1.44% (the trust range is 95%: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (the trust range is 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and acute pneumonia.
Corona viruses are a species of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single-chain RNA genome that is positively oriented.
It can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, and is known to infect humans.
The S-coated fork of the diabetic protein is related to its cellular receptors, the Agiotensin 2 (ACE2)-converting enzyme and the B-bitidyl peptide 4 (DP4) for SARS-Cove and Mers-Cove, respectively, and then the membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the viral genome has been cloned, the genomic RNA combined with the glucocorticoid proteins and vesicle-containing penile proteins forms virion, and it then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coV with a genetic identity exceeding 99.98% among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan seafood market of Buhan.
Sars-Cove-2 is more genetically similar to Sars-Cove than Mers-Cove.
It was revealed through an electronic microscopy of the transition that SARS-CoV-2 is present in very thin sections of the human airway epithelium.
Angiotensin-converted human enzyme 2 has been revealed to be the future of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 is weaker than SARS-CoV, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-COV-2 can also form a short, novel protein encoded by ORF3B and a secreted protein encoded by ORF8.
Orf3b in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and limit the expression IFNβ; however, orf8 does not have any range or pattern that has a known function.
On February 18, 2020, Zhu et al. reported the structure of the full length of the human enzyme converted to angiotensin 2 under a 2.9 Å ultra-cold electron microscope within a compound with an amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They discovered that the compound, which had open and closed structures, had assembled to form a demer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind to the S protein, providing evidence to identify the coronavirus and infection.
The sodium-based neutral amino acid carrier may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress the infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Original host and intermediate host.
It has been known that both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated from bats and were transported to humans via cats of yoghurt and beauty, respectively.
By comparing the progenitor evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bats were considered the original host of SARS-CoV-2, with the new virus matching 96% with two SARS-like bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross the inter-factional barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and has yet to clarify the course of the transition.
J. et al. suggested snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which involved a similar recomposition within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou China have suggested that squamous ant eaters — long-tongue ant eaters often used in traditional Chinese medicine — are the likely intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic symmetry in the coronavirus discovered in squamous ant eaters and in SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference across two genomes is still a big difference; therefore, we await conclusive results with concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The chemical physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 remain largely unknown.
SARS-COV and MERS-COV can survive in the laboratory for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20°C and humidity between 40% and 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56°C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol with a concentration of 75%, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorohexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
The entire human race generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so they are more likely to develop the new virus.
Currently, there is no detailed study on the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies related to other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after a host virus invasion, the natural immune system recognizes it through pattern recognition receptors (PRS), including C-type lint-like receptors, TLR-like receptors, NLR-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through different pathways, the virus induces the emergence of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of interferons of type I (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the large pharyngeal cells of viral antigens.
However, the N protein in SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
The adaptive immune response quickly joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies intended for the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T-cell aids produce inflammatory-activated cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, the coronavirus can reduce T-cell function by inducing programmed death of T-cells.
Mixture immunity, including supplemental proteins such as C3a, C5a and antibodies, is also essential in the fight against viral infections.
For example, isolated antibodies neutralized a recovering Mers-Cove patient.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, a failure of multiple organ functions and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which initially appeared in groups, is more likely to affect older people with multiple diseases and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune function has been compromised to be more likely to develop infections than others.
The estimated average incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, or between 3 and 7 days mostly, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period averaged 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A newer study, as shown above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, and then prevent people with infection but not experiencing symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, people exposed to or infected with the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the main and initial symptom of covid-19, and may not be accompanied by any other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal bump, chest pain, feeling nauseated, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients developed rapidly to experience acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and thromboembolism.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever should be screened, even without imaging that detects pulmonary abnormalities, for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed respiratory support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group to which the infection was transmitted from a person who did not show symptoms.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that Mers-Cove patients also suffered from fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, 80 percent of them needed much more respiratory support than patients with COVID-19 and were consistent with the higher MERS death rate than those with COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26 percent) and sore throat (21 percent) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, it turns out that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) are the most important symptoms, and respiratory support is needed for about 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2 percent, while confirmed cases were 66,576 globally.
By comparison, SARS death toll by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For Mears, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on a demographic study conducted in June 2012.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2's primary breeding number was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence range from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV's primary breeding number ranged from just 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their own symptoms, mortality rate, and primary breeding number is shown in Table 1.1.
The figures above indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than that of Mers-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the last two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the Mers-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The onset of the disease occurs in populations often in the same family or from the same grouping or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of traveling to or staying in Wuhan or other affected areas, or of contact with people or patients during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, people are reported to be able to carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks, and recovering patients who have been discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, sending an alarm to increase quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or low number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, the lack of lymphocytes was detected with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, high levels of aspartate amine transporter and blood indexing in 1,099 patients with covid-19.
Levels of liver, muscle, and myoglobin enzymes have risen in the blood of some patients, and the increased C-reactive protein and the rate of erythrocyte heaviness in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe conditions, the level of D-dimer, which is caused by fibrin cracking in the blood, gradually decreased the number of lymphocytes.
Radiography imbalances appear in most patients with COVID-19 and are characterized by double patchy shades or opacity of glass filtered into the lungs.
Patients sometimes have atypical pneumonia, severe lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, inflammation that is out of control, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis strongly affect the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of the pulmonary cells of type 1 and type 2 reduces the level of the surfactant and increases the surface tension, therefore, reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography and maximum severity of the disease are often compared.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumococcal exfoliation, hyalign membrane formation, interstitial lymphatic filtration, and multiple cell nuclei in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, in line with viral infection pathology and acute respiratory distress syndrome and similar to what happens to patients with SARS and MERS.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PT-PCR) as a key standard for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negative results, which may speed up the epidemic, clinical manifestations of the diagnosis (which is no longer individually dependent on RTPCR) began to be used in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred in SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiation imaging discoveries is essential for an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Chang Group described a protocol for using CRISPR-based Sherlock technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, and it detects pieces of SARS-CoV-2-created RNA at a rate of 20×10-18 mmol/L to 200×10-18 mmol/L (10-100 copies per μL of input) using a dip in less than an hour without the need for precise hardware.
We hope that the new technology will be able to improve sensitivity and suitability significantly if it is verified in clinical samples.
Due to a lack of experience with the novel coronavirus, doctors can provide mainly supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed before to treat other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2.2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovering patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovering patients has been suggested to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are racing to develop antibodies and antiviral vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at first, and may also, to a lesser extent, attack other organs that release the converted enzyme angiotensin 2, such as the digestive system, intestines, and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the most serious threats to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is necessary to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, non-invasive respirators, and invasive respirators based on the severity of the disease.
Patients with acute respiratory symptoms should be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMOH), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat heart failure or life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining fluid balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions, are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm is caused by an excessive immune system reaction in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines that include TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals and are the main cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially for acute patients.
Activated hormones, tocilizumab, and a monoclonal anti-interleukin 6 antibody have been used to treat a cytokine storm.
Other cytokine storm immunosuppression treatments include T-cell-directed immune reaction modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; Janus kinase inhibition; Plinatomomap; cytokine signal capping 4; and Heston Decitilez inhibitors.
Steroids and immunosuppressants have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in larger doses were not helpful with severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, it may cause severe side effects, especially nonvascular bone necrosis, which strongly affects the prognosis of the disease.
However, it has been recommended that short cycles of anabolic hormones be used in small to medium doses with caution for cases of severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, it was discovered that giving remedicivir, a neocletide counterpart, intravenously was effective with an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdecifer is a novel antiviral developed by Gilead initially to treat diseases caused by Ebola virus and Marburg.
Later, Rimdesevier also showed potential inhibition of other single-chain RNA viruses, including the MERS virus and SARS.
Based on these viruses, Gilead has provided the compound to China for some tests on individuals with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, barytinib, interferon-alpha, lupinavier/retonavier, and ribavierin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur after combination therapy in lupinavier/retonavier.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used with patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and the generation of antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovering patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (IG) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects, and they recognize and neutralize the unique molecules in pathogens directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with serious conditions.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are essential to roll out this method for widespread use before specific treatments can be found.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related defects must be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can trigger an overly stimulating immune reaction and cause cytokine release syndrome, potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high for the treatment of patients with critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop specific antibodies and produce them quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovering patients and identifying genetic codes that encode active antibodies, or screening for active antibodies against essential proteins of the virus, is more decisive and practical.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of multiple components in a combination that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure as they are difficult to extract and check for these ingredients or their optimal formulations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for covid-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the effectiveness of Xu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua King Wen capsules for the treatment of COVID-19 has been discovered.
The highest rates of recovery in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China, where traditional Chinese medicine was used in 87% of its patients, including Ganzhou (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only traditional Chinese medicine with about 30% of its patients, had the lowest rate of recovery (13%).
However, this is a completely approximate comparison, as many other impact factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their conditions should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Polly Chang and his business partners published a study to compare Western Medicine (WIM) treatment alone with Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine.
They discovered that the durations needed to recover from high body temperature, symptoms, and hospitalization were much shorter in the group of Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine than in the group of Western Medicine only.
Most impressively, the rate of worsening symptoms (ranging from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine group compared to the Western Medicine group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the mortality rate was lower in the Western Medicine + Traditional Chinese Medicine group compared to the Western Medicine group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine is still waiting for more well-studied trials on larger scales and in more centers.
It will also be interesting to describe the mechanism of the procedures and clarify the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine treatments or their formulations if possible.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 are often very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal illness, and people who are quarantined are bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as the negative effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by anabolic hormones, can lead to more anxiety and mental disorder.
In the first phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of mental illnesses including permanent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Compulsory contact and quarantine tracking, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigmatization of their entire family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, people suspected of developing it, and people who are in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear contacts, regular and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans, and the use of specialized electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact.
Effective vaccines to cut off the virus transmission chain from animal repositories and infected humans to susceptible hosts are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy in the fight against epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate neutral, effective, long-term and/or protective antibodies against SARS-CoV.
Debilitating live vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS treatment.
However, the effectiveness of these candidate vaccines in the living body in older adults and the fatal challenge models and in preventing them from contracting an animal-origin virus infection was not determined before the start of a clinical study.
This may be because SARS faded 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
By contrast, sporadic MERS cases and clusters continue to appear in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the continued presence of animal sources in endemic areas.
Immunization strategies against MERS were developed using inactive virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of recombinant protein, some of which were evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity individuals is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming difficulty is a challenge due to the length of time (an average of 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic changes of coronaviruses.
COVID-19, as a new disease, has just begun to show its full clinical course through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually with no consequences.
However, COVID-19, like SARS and MERS, is also associated with high rates of disease prevalence and mortality in severe patients.
Therefore, building a model of disease prognosis is essential for health care agencies to prioritize their services, particularly in resource-limited areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: It was the most important factor to determine the prognosis for SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
People between the ages of 30 and 65 were mainly infected with covid-19, with 47.7% of these patients over the age of 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care were much more likely to develop underlying diseases and complications and were much older than those who did not need them (average age 66 vs. 51), suggesting age as a predictive factor for the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Concomitant diseases and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart injuries and irregular heartbeats.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is also reported to be associated with positive bile cells with the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2, which can lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the underlying age and disease are strongly related and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury, and has been suggested to be a predictive factor for the disease, response to treatment, and final recovery.
The link between the C-reactive protein level and the severity of COVID-19 disease and its prognosis has also been suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate amine tanker (AST), alanine amine transporter enzyme (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes appear strongly in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional signs of dysfunctions of the heart or liver.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and the progress of clinical symptoms must be considered together along with other problems to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressants as an adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of a high dose of anabolic hormones on a large scale in SARS patients, many survivors have suffered osteochondrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short time in patients with COVID-19, if necessary.
Mental stress: As described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients experienced exceptional stress; they often endured long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help those patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological features than SARS.
In addition to reincarnation in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reincarnate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients with early-stage or incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during daily activities, causing difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were in a severe condition, while most transmissions of SARS-CoV did not occur in the early stage.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Efforts are currently underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost all residents in the hope of hindering the transfer of SARS-COV-2.
Although these measures have greatly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, signaling a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the receding phase will last for between 3 and 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have as much optimism.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others created a model for predicting the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-Cove-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered in mid- and throat oyster swabs for patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting the newly discovered virus could become a flu-like cyclical seizure.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the number of new cases declining, which suggests that current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, the disease was eventually controlled by strict quarantine and isolation measures.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 becomes weaker in terms of causing infection and eventually goes away or becomes a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
Below is a comparison of the pandemic of COVID-19 epidemics of SARS and MERS (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted at a higher rate through coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted through direct contact with substances contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of passing from feces to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41 percent of cases may be caused by hospital infections, including 17 patients with previous illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, significant precautions are required to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even passers-by who have communicated with infected patients or people.
Wearing face masks is the first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (No. 1860s series) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected person from moving through the air or sticking to the surfaces of the material, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (Series 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small ferrins by between 10 and 80 nm, with only 5% of the ferrins being able to fully penetrate; SARS-Cove-2 is similar to SARS-Cove in size and each is approximately 85 nm in size.
Since particles can penetrate up to five combined surgical masks, health care providers who are directly in contact with patients must wear N95 masks (No. 1860s series) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers must wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce communication with the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor with SARS-CoV-2 was injured despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face protectors or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with more disinfectant soap than usual, try to stay at home for self-quarantine and limit contact with potential individuals.
Three feet is a convenient distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV as reported on January 7, 2020 would have caused a high alert in China based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan did not reassure citizens until 19 January 2020 by saying that the new virus has a low infection rate and limited human-to-human reproduction and there is no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message severely reduced public preparedness, especially when the entire state was preparing for the Spring Festival, and lost critical time to contain the disease at its lowest scale in Wuhan.
China's disease control agencies may benefit from this harsh lesson and implement substantial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when releasing public data because every word is important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) more sensitive and engaging with unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restricted to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more issuing targeted and effective training to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and periodically improve the community response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
It has spread in less than two months across China and around 50 other countries globally at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has triggered a sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the rate of severity and mortality is also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
People with COVID-19 transmit the virus even when they don't have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do this when they are severely ill, causing greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Normal SARS-CoV-2 RNA screening can be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, recovering patients can get the virus again.
These results significantly increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With this rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many critical issues to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Despite the discovery of a 96% genetic symmetry between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronavirus in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
Which animal was the intermediate type that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numeric 1 and 2, we cannot stop the transition efficiently, and outbreaks can come back at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also associated with cells secreted for the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot make a quick and accurate diagnosis and provide effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a worldwide pandemic, vanish like SARS, or come back again periodically like the flu?
It is necessary but it may take some time to look for answers to the questions above and many other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our lives back to normal.
Animal Origins of Human Corona Viruses
The mutation and adaptation have been driving the co-development of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two types of human coronaviruses (HRVs) cause mild illness, such as the cold.
The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has shown the other face to reveal how severe and life-threatening human coronavirus infections can be.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 led to a re-introduction of the coronavirus, and we were surprised by its rapid spread but with the ability to cause disease compared to his brother SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus is an animal disease of origin so our understanding of the animal origins of human coronaviruses will serve us well.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats where they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate repositories of certain human coronaviruses have also been known.
The identification of host animals has a direct impact on the prevention of human diseases.
The investigation of the interactive relationships between the coronavirus and the host in animals also provides an important insight into the emergence of the coronavirus disease in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the information available about the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery as well as their animal origins and the transition between species.
The most important thing is that we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recomposition of the genome.
In this context, the disease caused by the current 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) is discussed.
In addition, it also highlights the requirements for successful replacement of the host and the effect of complications of the development of the virus on the severity of the disease.
Corona viruses (coronaviruses) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of viruses coated with single-chain RNA positives.
These viruses contain the largest genome among RNA viruses with 26 to 32 kilo bases and are called "coronary viruses" by this name because their composition resembles a crown under an electron microscope.
In terms of synthetic properties, coronaviruses contain undivided genomes that share similar regulation.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large interlaced open-reading templates (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into multiple-replicated proteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Multiple proteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains open reading templates for structural proteins, including Spike (S), Encapsulation (E), Membrane (M) and Nuclear Protein (N).
Different strains of coronaviruses also encode a number of additional proteins from special strains.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four types (corona alpha virus, corona beta virus, corona gamma virus, and corona delta virus), among which the types of corona betas that include most of the human corona viruses are divided into four strains (a, b, c, and d).
Evidence of genetic evolution has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic origin of most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
Over thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed species barriers and some have emerged as serious human pathogens.
So far, seven human coronaviruses (HRVs) are known.
Among them are the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-NL63, both of which belong to the alpha-coronaviruses.
The other five beta coronaviruses include human coronavirus-OC43, human coronavirus-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Human corona virus-229E, human corona virus-OC43, human corona virus-HKU1, and human corona virus-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as cold, diarrhea or both.
By contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 virus are all highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections to a greater number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and non-pulmonary symptoms.
It was isolated from the human coronavirus-229E, the first strain B814, from nasal discharge of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Much of the information has since been gathered by extensive studies of the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43, whose symptoms automatically heal.
In fact, it was generally accepted that human coronavirus infections were harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is among the deadliest epidemics in our present history, with more than 8,000 people infected with an estimated 10% mortality.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaked a steady epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The novel human coronavirus 2019, renamed SARS COV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm bell is ringing and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses have animal origins of bats, mice, or pets.
Multiple evidence supports that the evolutionary origins of all human coronaviruses are bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but exhibit significant genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has created enormous medical, scientific, social, and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Tracking the animal origins of human coronaviruses has shown a framework for understanding natural history, driving force and limiting factors for interspecies mobility.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2's warehouse, intermediate host, and inflated host animal, with important effects to prevent future repercussions.
In this review we provide an overview of animal assets, interspecies transmission, and human coronaviruses cause diseases.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common belief that human coronaviruses are usually not pathogenic in their natural repositories but become pathogenic after they are passed on between species to a new host.
We also review the assessment of the course of the human coronavirus as it is often accompanied by an increase in its susceptibility to transmission and a decrease in the severity of diseases.
We also discuss in this context the results of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of human coronavirus-229E was first isolated from nasal discharges of cold patients, various types of coronaviruses were isolated from various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the past decades, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
The presentation of a brief summary of the history of the discovery of the human coronavirus in chronological order (Table 1) will be educational and indicative.
The first strain of human coronavirus-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, after which it adapted to live in the ranks of WI-38 lung cells.
Patients with human coronavirus-229E have common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, sore throat, with fever, and cough in approximately 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, the human coronavirus-OC43 was isolated from the organ farm and the subsequent transmission was in the brains of the infant mice.
Clinical features of the human coronavirus-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by the human coronavirus-229E, which is indistinguishable from other respiratory viruses such as influenza A and nasal viruses.
Both the human coronavirus-229E and the human coronavirus-OC43 have spread globally, and are mostly inclined to move through the winter season in a temperate climate.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a sense of illness for about two weeks.
According to a human voluntary study, healthy individuals with the human coronavirus-229E had a mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe injury to the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, is the first human coronavirus pandemic to be well documented in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be detected.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 confirmed infections and 774 deaths, and has spread across many countries and continents.
Regardless of the supercontagion vector, it is estimated that a single case can lead to approximately two secondary cases, with a incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak viral load appears on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-Cove symptoms begin with muscle pain, headache, fever, malaise, and chills, followed as delayed symptoms with difficulty breathing, coughing, and respiratory distress.
Lack of lymph, liver dysfunction, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory disorders of SARS.
SARS patients also notice widespread senile damage, proliferation of phenocells, and an increase in the number of pharyngeal cells.
About 20-30% of patients then need intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, in severe cases, many organs, including the digestive system, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be particularly fatal in patients with immunodeficiency.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the first case who traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to conducting research on the human coronavirus.
Human coronavirus-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be common in young children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients with respiratory diseases.
Colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common symptoms of the human coronavirus-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described isolating the virus itself from a sample of an 8-month-old child with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It is estimated that the human coronavirus-NL63 is responsible for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, peaking during early summer, spring and winter.
Human coronavirus-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as suffocation.
That same year, the human-HKU1 coronavirus was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, it has been reported that the human coronavirus-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of severe asthma attacks.
Human coronavirus-HKU1 has been found to be globally widespread, causing mild respiratory illnesses, similar to the human coronavirus-NL63, the human coronavirus-229E, and the human coronavirus-OC43.
All four of these human coronaviruses acquired from society have adapted well to humans and in general the likelihood that they will mutate to cause diseases with a low prevalence, but the coincidence occurred for unknown reasons as in the rare case of the most ferocious subtype of human coronavirus-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, when these coronaviruses gain the ability to move efficiently and maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Mers-Cove was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, in many European countries and Tunisia, cases have been reported from abroad and a rare secondary transmission of contacts in close personal contact.
Another secondary outbreak in South Korea in 2015 resulted in 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms caused by MERS are similar to those caused by SARS, and are characterized by a worsening acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many people with MERS also experienced severe kidney failure, which is what MERS is distinguished from other diseases caused by the human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making Mers-Cove one of the most known destructive viruses for humans.
From mid-December to late 2019, groups of pneumonia patients known to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the current outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as an international public health emergency as it was called by the COVID-19.
On 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with an initial death rate of 3.4%.
It should be noted that the death rate in Hubei province of China is 4.2%, while outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and appears in the form of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea also appears in some people.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homogeneity of the nucleotide sequence by 82%, they belong to different branches in the tree of evolution of breeds.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less severe but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
People with no symptoms have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may be contributing to its rapid spread around the world.
The comparison and contrast between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses revealed significant similarities and differences.
First, human coronaviruses are similar in the incubation period and time period of the disease.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 infection falls between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from society (i.e., the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-HKU1, and the human coronavirus-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 is more common in cases of community-acquired human coronaviruses, including the appearance of unspecified or minor symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of covid-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 transition shows interesting patterns for both human coronavirus acquired from the community and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the transmissibility of human coronavirus acquired from society.
On the other hand, it remains to be ascertained whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples as in other human coronaviruses.
Further studies are still needed in the future to clarify whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by oral anal route plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least in some cases.
It is worth paying attention to whether SARS-CoV-2 may show seasonal spread as in cases of human coronavirus acquired from the community.
However, the traits of SARS-CoV-2, including the possibility of transition, and the mechanism of disease and sustainable spread after the transition of humans will have an impact on the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
All four human coronaviruses acquired from the community and causing minor symptoms have adapted well to humans.
Another perspective, which may also be true, is that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may be survivors of ancient human coronavirus epidemics.
Human coronaviruses that infect humans have been eradicated from acute diseases as well as from humans who have contracted acute human coronavirus diseases.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be sufficiently replicated to allow adaptive mutations to accumulate that face the host's limiting factors.
Based on this logic, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and the greater the number of people with it, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, it is difficult to stop its transmission between humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four coronaviruses acquired from society have been circulating among human populations for many years, causing a cold in people with good immunity.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
By contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were not well-adapted and could not continue the human transition.
They need to stay in and multiply in their animal reservoirs and then look for the right opportunity to move on to the most vulnerable human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate and amplified hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired from the community.
It is as contagious as human coronaviruses acquired from society, at least for now.
However, it causes more disease than human coronaviruses acquired from the community and less than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is not yet clear whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread among them without the need for a warehouse or intermediary animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it would be useful for us to review the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplified human coronaviruses.
The animal acts as the evolutionary host of the human coronavirus if the virus harbors the closely related origin and shares a significant similarity in the level of sequences of nucleotides.
The original virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic to this host.
Similarly, the host harbors the human corona virus continuously and over a long period of time.
In both cases, the hosts are infected naturally and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its father virus.
By contrast, if the human coronavirus enters the newly intermediate host before it attacks humans or near it, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes morbidity.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of human infection and it performs the role of an amplified host by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and thus transmit it to humans to expand the range of infection among humans.
Human coronavirus infection may reach a dead end if the virus fails to spread from within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host so that they may colonize it for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural warehouse host.
Epidemiological data later revealed that the first case of SARS had a contact history with the game.
Serological diffusion surveys then indicated that animal traders had a higher rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgG prevalence compared to normal people.
For the first time, it was determined that the masked sieve yoghurt (Paguma larvata) and raccoon in live animal markets carried SARS-Cove-like viruses that almost matched SARS-Cove.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no other case of SARS was reported after all the yoghurt cats were killed in the markets.
However, it has been reported that the result of SARS-CoV screening in masked palm yogurt that lives in the wild or farms without exposure to live animal markets has been largely negative, suggesting that masked palm yogurt may be only an intermediate amplified host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Noting that as 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou markets have SARS-Cove antibodies, the likelihood that multiple types of small mammals also play the role of SARS-Cove's amplified intermediate host is not ruled out.
It seems that all of these are hosts who do not transfer SARS-COV.
The subsequent search for SARS-CoV's animal natural host led to the detection of the closely related coronavirus, called the HKU3 (HKU3), which is found in Chinese HKU3.
The result of the screening of SARS-CoV antibodies in these bats and the sequence of the virus genome of the most virulent Chinese horseshoe virus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome HKU3 was positive.
This virus and other bat coronaviruses share an 88-92% symmetry of nucleotide sequences with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
Several severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-like coronaviruses (Several acute respiratory syndrome virus-like coronaviruses) have been identified from bats, but none have been isolated as a live virus except WIV1.
Human Angiotensin 2 (Angiotensin 2) is known as the recipient of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from a feces sample of bats has been shown to use the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 in bats, yoghurts, and humans as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, serum recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome had the potential to equalize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related origin of SARS-CoV in bats, as they share a 95% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the direct father of SARS-Cove and that bats are not the direct host of SARS-Cove.
The MERS-CoV evolution analysis combines the coronavirus-HKU4 group in bats and the coronavirus-HKU5 in bats themselves.
The coronavirus-HKU4 is used in bats and Mers-Cove host receptor itself, a peptide-4 dipeptide (peptide peptide 4), to enter the virus.
Mers-Cove DNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are closer in terms of the evolution of strains to their counterparts than the beta-coronaviruses in bats identified in Europe and Africa.
It has not yet been discovered that Merse-Cove lives in wild bats.
Mers-Cove and the HKU25 virus share the bats closest to it, symmetry of the nucleotide sequences by only 87%.
Thus, the host bat may not be the direct warehouse of Mers-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the only positive hump beauty for Mers-Cove's equivalent antibodies, as well as the beauty of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Mers-Cove has isolated the hominin-conforming neighborhood from the nasal swabs of the sole beauty of the hump, indicating that beauty plays the role of the original host of Mers-Cove.
It is also worth noting that minor symptoms generally appear in a beauty experimentally infected with Mers-Cove, but heavy viral scattering has been observed.
Infected beauty was remarkably scattering viruses not only through breathing but also through the oral anal route, which is the main route to spawning the virus from bats.
However, there are still questions as many confirmed Mers cases have no contact history with beauty prior to the onset of symptoms, and these cases are attributed in terms of logic to human-to-human transmission or anonymous transmission methods involving unrecognised species harboring Mers-Cove.
SARS COV-2 RATG13 virus is involved in bats isolated from horseshoe bats in the symmetry of nucleotides by 96.2%.
The variability of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is so long that it is difficult to determine the relationship with the father, as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
This means that bats may not be the direct host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless coronaviruses for bats are found to be almost identical in the future.
SARS-CoV-2 intermediate hosts are supposed to be among the wild animal species sold and killed in the Wuhan seafood market, which has been linked to several initial cases of COVID-19, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transition.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomics sequence have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as squamous ant eater (Manis javanica) can also harbor the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this novel ant-eating coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share an 85-92% symmetry of nucleotide sequences.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of the nucleotide sequences.
They are grouped into two subspecies of SARS-like cove-2 viruses in the tree of evolution of the strains, one of which shares a similar receptor binding (receptor binding field) with SARS-Cove-2, matching amino acid sequences by 97.4%.
In stark contrast, the receptor binding fields of SARS-CoV-2 differ significantly from RaTG13, although the entire genome sequence is higher.
A previous study on a sick squamous ant eater also revealed the presence of viral organisms from lung samples, which similarly turned out to be associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different aggregation methods and manual processing to generate a partial genome sequence consisting of the full-length viral genome of approximately 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that a squamous ant eater is one of SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host animals.
However, there is currently no evidence to support that squamous ant eater is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the variation of the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta coronaviruses in squamous ant eater.
In addition, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is less than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant eater.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, squamous ant eaters, and other mammals is still under appointment.
While the highest sequential symmetry has been found in the receptor binding fields between SARS-CoV-2 and squamous ant eater, the beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RATG13 share the highest symmetry of the whole genome sequence.
One of the dominant speculations is that the high degree of similarity between the areas of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding in the squamous ant-eater of the coronavirus beta and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal is likely to be recombined between SARS-CoV-2 in the beta squamous ant eater and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
Reinstallation is widespread among beta-coronaviruses as a driving force for evolution.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been confirmed.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the animal origin of the human coronavirus-229E, the human coronavirus-OC43, the human coronavirus-NL63, and the human coronavirus-HKU1 has also been studied.
The evidence for the evolution of strains has indicated that both the human coronavirus-NL63 and the human coronavirus-229E may have originated from the bat coronavirus, while the father viruses of the human coronavirus-OC43 and the human coronavirus-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It has been reported that the coronavirus in bats called ARCoV.2 (Corona virus of the Appalachian Highlands) detected in tricolor bats in North America has a close relationship with the human coronavirus-NL63.
On the other hand, the human coronavirus-229E was found to be genetically linked to another coronavirus in bats, called Hipposideros/GanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, and the camels were also suspected of being its intermediate host.
For clarification, current information about known human coronavirus animal origins is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
An analysis of the evolution of strains has provided evidence of cases of human coronavirus transmission between species throughout history.
When the human-oc43 coronavirus crossed species to infect humans from domestic cattle around 1890, a respiratory infection epidemic was recorded.
The history of transmission of the human coronavirus-229E between species is still less clear.
It was discovered that alpha-coronaviruses in bats are closely related to the human coronavirus-229E.
There is an alpha-coronavirus in the alpaca.
Many evidence supports the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have a bat connection in a common habitat.
While humans have close contact with alpaca.
Second, the human coronavirus-229E that belongs to the alpha-coronavirus in bats is multiple and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-coronavirus in alpaca causes outbreaks of respiratory diseases in infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-coronavirus associated with alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, the possibility that alpaca was infected with the human coronavirus-229E belonging to the alpha-coronavirus can not be ruled out from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of viruses that cause diseases to humans including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it is not surprising that bats may transmit the human coronavirus-229E to humans directly.
While the alpha-coronaviruses in bats act as the synthesis of the human coronavirus-229E genes, alpaca and the only beauty hump may act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as is the case in Mers-Cove.
Merse-Cove gives an excellent example of the transition between species as it moves from bats to hump-only beauty and from hump-only beauty to humans.
The evolutionary origin of Mers-Cove has been known from bats since the beginning of their identification and has also been enhanced by subsequent results.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus types to exchange genetic pieces within a species and transfer them between species.
Bats are characterized by longevity, living in overcrowded colonies, close social interaction, and a strong ability to fly, all of which are favorable conditions to make them an ideal "virus distributor".
On the other hand, Merse-Cove has moved on to the only beauty hump for decades.
These beauties have been well adapted until they have been transformed from a medium host to a natural and stable warehouse host.
Mers-Cove causes very minor disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
His intermittent transmission to humans remains coincidental and man is a non-carrier host for Merse-Cove where his transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of beauty in the transfer of Mers-Cove, the role of the squamous ant eater, if any, in the transfer of SARS-Cove-2 is different.
In particular, the beta-coronavirus associated with squamous ant-eating affects it with severe disease.
They may be non-carrier hosts for SARS-CoV-2, similar to a yoghurt cat in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies will determine many possibilities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between species of animals to humans either by proving or excluding them.
First, bats may be the host of a virus reservoir associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is often identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans and bats may share an ecological habitat through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, squamous ant eater can be one of the intermediate amplified hosts of the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans are infected with the virus by slaughtering and consuming bush meat.
Many mammals, including pets, are likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is justification for a survey of antibodies in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the re-fitting and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has a connection to bats and squamous ant eaters.
The search for the animal origin of SARS COV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, it is on the viral side that there are three main and also important factors in facilitating the infection of coronaviruses to overcome the barriers of species.
First, the mutation rates have a relatively high doubling of RNA.
Estimated rates of coronavirus mutations, compared to other single-chain RNA viruses, can be considered "medium" or "high" with an average rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year for site 2, depending on the stage of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts.
Coronaviruses include an external reponcillating reponcillaase enzyme, which is omitted to very high transmutability and attenuation or inability to develop.
Interestingly, remdecifer for nucleotides is known for its ability to suppress the transcription of the coronavirus by inhibiting the enzyme exogenous ribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remedesiver is an anti-SARS Cove-2 gratifying agent scheduled for clinical trials.
However, the rates of coronavirus mutations increase by about a million times more than the rates of hostesses.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when coronaviruses do not adapt appropriately to the host.
The rate of mutations for SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably low when compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, which indicates a higher level of adaptation to humans.
He seems to have already adapted to another human-close host.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to Mers-CoV, which has adapted well to the only beauty of the hump.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to help vaccines and antiviral drugs resist SARS-CoV-2 by rapidly weakening its effectiveness.
Second, the colossal DNA genome in coronavirus actively provides additional microplasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspecies development, which benefits the emergence of new coronaviruses when conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the unique plentiful open-reading templates and protein-encrypted functions near the end of the 3′′ genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and repeatedly switch molds during RNA transcription through a unique "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that is like a blending vessel, sequencing occurs frequently during copies of the RNA of the coronavirus.
High-symmetry, full-length, secondary genomic RNAs may recombine to generate new coronaviruses.
A guide to the evolution of strains for natural recompositioning has been discovered in human coronavirus-HKU1 and human coronavirus-OC43, as well as animal coronaviruses as in severe acute respiratory syndrome virus in bats and coronavirus-HKU9 in bats.
The interaction of the virus with the host associated with the transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another major factor influencing the transition between species.
In this regard, we take SARS-CoV re-installation as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transition incidents.
Based on a comparative analysis of isolated samples of SARS-CoV in humans and the yoghurt cat, SARS-CoV is thought to be undergoing rapid adaptation in various hosts, particularly through mutations occurring in the receptor binding field of S-protein.
In general, the receptor binding field of S-coronavirus interacts with the cellular receptor and is heavily selected by the anti-host body response.
In SARS-COV, the receptor binding field occurs in amino acids from 318 to 510 in the S1 block, which is related to the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2 as well as to the auxiliary receptors to enter the virus.
The receptor binding field at SARS-CoV is able to identify angiotensin 2-converting enzyme receptors helping in different animals, including bats, yoghurts, mice and raccoons, allowing the virus to spread between species.
In fact, only the remnants of 6 amino acids that were different from isolated viral samples from humans and the yoghurt cat have been observed in the receptor binding field, and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding sequencing pattern to interact with the receptor of the agiotensin-converting enzyme.
The K479N and S487T mutations are found in the receptor association of SARS-CoV in the yoghurt cat, which can increase the likelihood of the reaction of Spike protein in the receptor of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme.
In other words, these two types of amino acid substitutes may be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
There is a 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein, which implies that the probability of the S protein binding in the human agiotensin-converting enzyme has changed.
Indeed, a study with a super-cold electron microscopy indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher probability of this association compared to that between the human Agiotensin 2 transducer enzyme and the SARS-Cove S protein.
It is also interesting to determine whether any other type of auxiliary receptor may be required for the SARS-CoV-2 transition.
It is also interesting that the human coronavirus-NL63 is also associated with the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 but in a different part of the S protein.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as the human coronavirus-229E protein en analyzer, and the 9-O-cylic acid of the human coronavirus-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after the transition between species from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also subject to other factors of reliability and host constraints.
The bifurcation of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of coronaviruses, such as bats, hump camels, and rodents, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses need to control host dependency factors and weaken the constraints in them to implement a successful interspecies transition.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus interaction with the host remain detectable and determine properties.
A broad, unbiased examination of the genome can be leveraged to look for reliability factors and host constraints for SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR's cutting-edge technology.
The emergence of novel human coronaviruses: returning to the starting point
The diversity of coronaviruses in bats offers ample opportunities for the emergence of novel human coronaviruses.
Based on this logic, the coronaviruses in bats are a genetic complex of human coronaviruses.
In addition, the rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the development of the human coronavirus, which are two important points in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes involves the ability to significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among the regulatory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was thought to be important in adapting to humans, as SARS-CoV was isolated associated with viruses in bats but was found to encode different ORF8 proteins.
The 29 properties of sarc-cove nucleotide deletion were found in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion has divided ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombination through strains of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, with a large number of small recombination areas identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Reinstallation sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, research has shown that the Mears-Cove epidemic has seen cases of re-composition between different strains, which have occurred in the only humpback beauty in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant cases have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses have been combined with other animal coronaviruses in their own non-constructive genes.
It should be noted that artificial selection can also help with unintended changes in the viral genome, most of which result from the elimination of viruses from selective stressors, such as by the host's immune system.
The loss of a full-length ORF4 protein in the strain of the human coronavirus-229E phenotype due to the deletion of two nucleotide is an example of these effects.
Although a proper ORF4 can be observed in camel and bat viruses associated with the human coronavirus-229E, the alpha-coronavirus that infects the alpaca shows a single nucleotide suture, leading to a mutation of the control frame.
Last but not least, the development of new coronaviruses is also driven by selective pressure in their repositories.
Unaccompanied or mildly symptomatic cases have been detected only when bats are infected with coronaviruses, which indicates the mutual adaptation of coronaviruses and bats.
They showed that bats adapted appropriately to anatomically and physiologically pathogenic coronaviruses.
For example, the weak activation of the inflammatory response in bats has effectively reduced the pathogens raised by the coronavirus.
In addition, natural killer cellular activity was suppressed in bats due to an increase in the rate of NKG2/CD94 inhibitory natural killer cellular receptor and a decrease in the expression level of the main tissue compatibility compound molecules I.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen compounds (reactive oxygen compounds) arising from high metabolic activity of bats can lead to both suppression of the transcription of the coronavirus and the effect of correction by the exogenous ribonuclease enzyme, thus providing selective pressure for the emergence of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when a new host is infected.
Additional pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may arise by recombination, which leads to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt to the host.
Accordingly, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have emerged over the past two decades.
Corona viruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in repositories such as bats and camels.
They replicate strongly without triggering a strong immune response from the host.
Here are the secrets that explain why carriers of the virus who do not show symptoms and causes of acute conditions are seen in human infections.
Acute symptoms are mainly caused by an overactive immune response and a cytokine storm where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in the case of asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is separated from the transcription of the coronavirus.
A strategy similar to a separate immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the intake of interferon type I at least in the first stage of the infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be used in humans.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is weak.
With this mental logic, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory particle using the MCC950 inhibitor is beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general idea by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While it was discovered that the coronavirus beta in bats involved SARS-CoV in the 95% homogeneity of nucleotide, there was also the coronavirus in bats involved 96% of the homogeneity of nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
While it was discovered that the yoghurt cats and other animals in the markets harbor viruses similar to SARS-Cove, they did not detect SARS-Cove-2 intermediate direct hosts.
Corona beta viruses have been discovered in squamous ant eater that are highly homogeneous to SARS-CoV-2, which suggests that squamous ant eater animals may be one of the intermediate hosts or that the beta-coronavirus in squamous ant eater has contributed to genetic cuttings which has led to the arrival of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions are still on the table, there is no evidence that SARS COV-2 is man-made, either intentionally or by chance.
Corona viruses have returned to focus due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our thinking about the importance of the origins of zoonotic diseases and human zoonotic reservoirs in human transmission.
The overwhelming evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 all trace their origin to the bat and passed on to humans via intermediate hosts.
Based on the fact that the SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and yoghurt cats in the markets, the closure of fresh produce markets and the killing of yoghurt cats were supposed to effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same mental logic, squamous ant eater animals should be eliminated from fresh product markets to prevent the transmission of animal-origin disease, in light of the discovery of multiple genealogy of beta-coronaviruses in squamous ant eater that are very close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether or not SARS COV-2 is transmitted to humans, and no matter how it is transmitted, through squamous ant-eater animals and other mammals, its transmission remains a subject that needs to be clarified in future research.
On the other hand, Merse-Cove has been found in the only hump beauty for a long time.
This beauty is an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local citizens.
It is widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it's impossible to sacrifice all the beauty of controlling Maers, as did officials in China's wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop repeated outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective anti-MERS-Cove vaccines for beauty, as well as other infection control measures.
For our inability to completely eradicate these viruses, new genetic patterns may arise and cause outbreaks.
A variety of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases are found in wildlife.
In particular, coronaviruses are very diverse in bats that have the potential to cause zoonotic diseases.
There are many opportunities for the emergence and recombination of coronaviruses associated with zoonotic diseases, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or deadly coronaviruses in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In light of the adversity experienced by humanity because of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, an adequate preparedness and response plan should be prepared.
The truth is that a lot of viruses have taken their place on the planet for a very long time.
They live in their own natural repositories until they have a chance to spread and abound.
Although bats have many characteristics that are likely to spread viruses, the chance of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if humans adopt a culture that obliges them to stay away from them.
Continuous mammal monitoring is a necessary measure to better understand the environment of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which proves useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and preventing future occurrences.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent animal-origin viral diseases is for humans to stay away from the environmental positions of natural reservoirs of animal-origin viruses.
The mystery of the origin of the zoonotic disease of SARS-CoV-2 is still surrounded by many questions that require answering.
First, if bats have transferred the original SARS-CoV-2 virus to squamous ant eater, it is important to know the conditions for the participation of bats and squamous ant eater animals in a similar environmental setting.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the transmission of the disease to humans, then the method of human contact with them should be determined.
Third, if a third type of mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, then it should be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and squamous ant eaters.
Finally, since many mammals including pets may be suspected of carrying SARS-CoV-2, both observation and experimental infection should be performed.
Whether the host is a bat, squamous ant eater, or other mammals, it is expected to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent viruses from which it branches, which are roughly the same as its natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will reveal the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important measures to prevent and control COVID-19 in humans.
The need to update the standard of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" when diagnosed with COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus 2019 and this guidance provided our experience and included relevant reference information to combat the pandemic globally.
Although the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; and then diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to an inbound comment on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria, a "suspicious case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (version 7) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak (the 2019 novel coronavirus), which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and named the virus the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the pandemic as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team drafted a rapid guidance guideline and published it online in the Journal of Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has received great attention since his publication.
Please note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increases based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice trials; and then diagnostic and treatment strategies are constantly updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (/http://www.nhc.gov.cn), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, were issued seven versions in total, with some contexts changing substantially.
Our guidance is now responded to by Zhou and others, who have made a simple step-by-step proposal based on clinical trial.
Their efforts have added new evidence to our guidance and also become a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their efforts and express our appreciation.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (the seventh beta version) and recent studies.
According to version 7 (March 3, 2020), confirmation of the suspected condition needs to combine any elements of epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations to achieve a comprehensive analysis, or needs to verify three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (i) a date that includes travel to the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities reported to have had cases of COVID-19, or to have resided there, within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (ii) a date that includes communication with cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive DNA results); (iii) a date that includes communication with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan or surrounding areas or other communities reported to have had cases of COVID-19 within the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; and (iv) a date that includes communication with a cluster of confirmed cases (2 or more than those with fever and/or respiratory symptoms that occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (i) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (ii) with characteristics that demonstrate the imaging of a COVID-19 infection; and (iii) show the total number of white blood cells a normal, slightly, or low level of lymphocytes in the early stage of onset of infection.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspected case involving any elements of the evidence of pathogens or serum reactions as follows: (1) positive BCR test result in real-time SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity of the entire viral genome sequence with known novel coronavirus characteristics; (3) positive IgM antibody test results and IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in serum; or the IgG antibody change of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or the high calibration in recovery phase is equal to or more than 4 times that level in the acute phase.
We see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test for DNA in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second version (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The discovery of pathogens in the blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020); then the evidence of blood serum interactions was added to the seventh version.
These modifications relied on the researchers' ongoing work to arrive at the design of an ideal toolkit for detection via DNA for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported the transfer of the positive outcome of the specific antibody to the criteria of confirmed cases.
In addition, there is growing evidence that calls for caution when dealing with patients with unusual symptoms and conditions that are not accompanied by symptoms.
Therefore, the content of Zhou's information flow chart and others should be updated, classifying the person without clinical symptoms at a "low risk" score.
The grading system also needs to be validated in additional practice and clinical studies.
Finally, we hope to have access to more direct evidence as we invite our readers to provide us with their feedback.
To diagnose the "suspicious situation" and the "confirmed situation", we call for the following of the most recent guidelines issued by the countries of origin of persons and their adherence to them.
Our team will also update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh records five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily rate.
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) in Bangladesh reported that, as of yesterday, 114 active cases and 33 home-based recoveries had been reported.
17 deaths were recorded.
Director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research, Dr. Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, told an online press conference that the deaths included four males and one female.
According to Dr. Mirjadi, there were two cases over the age of 60, two between the ages of 51 and 60, and one case between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said two of the deaths were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
An official at an Anatolian hospital, a local news agency, said one of the deceased was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was receiving care at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaid al-Qader, said in an online video statement on Saturday that public transport would stop longer than initially planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was initially disabled on 26 March and the shutdown was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Basic goods are still allowed to be transported: medical products, fuel and food.
The first cases of COVID-19 were recorded in Bangladesh on March 8, for two people who returned from Italy, as well as one's wife.
The three had already recovered by March 19.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections has exceeded one million worldwide.
Data released by Johns Hopkins University on Thursday indicated that the total number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-causing coronavirus cases (SARS-CoV-2) has exceeded one million worldwide.
COVID-19 caused at least 52,000 deaths.
This dangerous development came on the same day that Malawi confirmed the first cases of coronavirus, and the first related death was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed to be, from Thursday, one of the few countries still free of coronavirus infections.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours leading up to 10 am CET (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the United States, with at least 5900 associated deaths.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by a coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, announced on Thursday the extension of the city's closure until May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that he would continue to pay the Russians without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes passed, 10 abstentions and one vote opposed.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the cities of Mecca and Medina to become all day long; it was earlier from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m. only.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Australia stores reduce the purchase limits of toilet paper per transaction.
Australian supermarket chains Wallworths and Coles on Saturday night and Sunday night tightened restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper to be reduced to two rolls of Wallworths stores and one roll of Coles stores per transaction across all branches nationwide.
Aldi stores also identified one roll on Monday.
These purchase restrictions were posted as messages at payment points in store chains and on their Facebook pages.
Buyers are reported to have stored it due to concerns related to COVID-19 in the event that people need self-isolated.
Wallworths stores on Wednesday passed restrictions on the delivery of toilet paper to homes to become one roll per purchase order.
The changes followed previous restrictions passed by Wallworths stores on March 4 and Coles stores on March 5 allowing only four rolls per transaction.
Coles stores reported in their March 8 media release that despite the application of the four roll restrictions, "many stores still sell everything they have within one hour of receiving it," and described the order as "unprecedented," as well as Aldi stores in a Facebook post on Tuesday as "unexpected."
Sales increased "significantly" last week, according to a Wallworths shop spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra last week also determined that the amount allowed to be purchased was a fascinate.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles stores asked suppliers for larger rolls and increased the pace of delivery, and Wallworths stores ordered additional stock, while Aldi stores made their inventory available for specials scheduled for early Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on truck delivery time are making it harder.
High production costs are expected, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few special offers.
On Tuesday, Aldi stores announced that as a result of the early availability of inventory, some stores would not be able to provide a special Wednesday offer.
Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, told News.com.au that stores fill stores every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a large commodity, which leads to a decrease in the amount of inventory in terms of numbers, and when sold in full, it leaves large empty spaces on the shelves, which enhances the feeling of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman, ABC News reported: "Colles and Woolworths stores have the view that if a lot of goods are available on shelves, and if products like toilet rolls and sterilizers can be bought and supplied in bulk, that may reduce panic."
Who Gives a Crab, which produces recycled toilet paper, reported last Wednesday that its stock was running out.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, which produces toilet wipes Clinics, and Solaris Pepper, which produces Sorbent wipes, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to continue providing their products.
Domain.com, a real estate site, noted that some real estate sellers offer free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were held because buyers stopped working on the long Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NTT News, a daily publication in Darwin City, included an eight-page ad fold that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
Shops initially hesitated about imposing restrictions, according to a report released by ABC Australia on March 3, where stores said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that there is also a high demand for other products, including masks, sterilizers, dried goods, hand lotion and flour.
In the same vein, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that a British online store called Okado identified toilet paper purchases by Andrés with two dozen rolls.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday that the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS-CoV-2, had reached the level of the pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only indicates how widespread the disease is, and not how serious specific cases are, the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted the need for governments to take the necessary measures:
All countries can still change the course of this epidemic.
WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: "If countries detect, test and treat people, isolate them, track their cases and mobilize them for confrontation,"
We are all very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and risk as well as the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
CNN reported in February, "No other respiratory virus has been traced from the onset to the ongoing global spread, other than the flu."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view: "We have never been hit by a pandemic caused by one of the coronaviruses."
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time.
The new situation is described as a pandemic following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak: "The bottom line is that things are going to get worse."
The Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide from Thursday, and more than 4600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak in Wuhan, China, was identified in December 2019 and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
China's death rate was estimated at 4%, while globally it ranged from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The period between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Recommended preventative measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, and maintaining the spacing between people, monitoring, and self-isolation of those suspected of developing them.
Authorities around the world are responding to this risk by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and a widespread supply shortage exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's students.
There have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of origin and appearance in East and Southeast Asia, and other areas where there have been major cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and closure rates for heavy industry, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei Province) China reported a range of pneumonia cases for an unknown reason on 31 December 2019, and the investigation began in early January 2020.
Cases are mostly linked to the Wuhan seafood market for wholesale sale, so the virus is thought to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that is closely related to coronaviruses in bats, coronaviruses in squat ant eaters, and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first person with symptoms contracted the disease on December 1, 2019, and this person did not have clear contact with the wet market group that was later discovered.
Of the early cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report published by the South China Morning newspaper indicated that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, was 55 years old from Hubei Province, possibly the first case. On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that despite the decline in new cases reported in China, they suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, where the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases within it for the first time.
There may be a significant lack of reporting of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with adults 19 years old and under 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, estimated that 60% of Britons need to be infected before effective herd immunity is performed.
Cases indicate the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and have been confirmed to have been infected in accordance with official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested for more than 3% of its population, and many countries have official policies regarding not performing the test for those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that an estimated 86% of cases of COVID-19 were not detected in China, until January 23, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection for 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of injuries in Italy was much higher than the recorded cases.
Initial estimates of the primary reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with covid-19 recover.
For those who don't recover, the period from worsening symptoms to death takes between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, COVID-19 has caused about 97,000 deaths.
About 80% of deaths in China began on February 5 in those over 60 years old, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official statistics of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who have been found to have been infected with COVID according to official protocols.
The real death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, because it may not include people who die without testing them – for example; at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data in Italy revealed that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official number of deaths recorded in a factor of 4-5x.
A CDC spokeswoman in the United States acknowledged that "we know [the reported death toll] reflects a lower estimate than reality," a statement backed by narrative reports suggesting inaccuracy in the United States. Such a lack of estimates occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death in Wuhan was on January 9, 2020.
The first case of death outside mainland China was on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first case of death outside Asia in France was on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica. Many measures are commonly used to determine the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and over time, affected by the size of tests, quality of the health care system, treatment options and time taken since the outbreak began, and characteristics of populations such as age, sex, and public health. The mortality to injury ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality to injury ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of mortality from injuries dropped from 17.3% (for those who had symptoms from January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other measures point to the CFR, which reflects the percentage of those who died from the disease, and the AFR, which reflects the percentage of those who have been infected and those who have not been infected, who die from an illness.
These statistics do not have a time frame and trace a specific population from injury to the fate of the condition.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The Oxford University Evidence-Based Medical Center estimates that the overall infection mortality rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest estimate of this range corresponds to the results of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany, and with a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on estimates of case mortality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stresses the possibility of controlling the pandemic.
The peak of the outbreak and its maximum duration are uncertain and may vary by location.
Massig Bonnie of Pennsylvania State University said: "Infectious disease outbreaks that are left uncontrollably usually peak and begin to decline when the disease doesn't find available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to come up with any logical prediction right now about the timing of that."
Chinese government chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it could "end by June" if all countries could be motivated to follow WHO advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kocharsky of the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 would be "spread for perhaps a year or two."
According to a study conducted by Imperial College London under the supervision of Neil Ferguson, we will need to rely on physical spacing and other measures "so that a vaccine becomes available (perhaps after 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think this coronavirus isn't likely to disappear completely -- because it's easily transmissible," and may "turn into a seasonal disease -- so that it returns every year."
The ferocity of return will depend on collective immunity and the extent of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and may not show symptoms on the infected.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea, or glaucoma. The World Health Organization confirms that nearly one in six people has severe illness and has difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States has limited emergency symptoms in difficulty breathing, constant chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and glaucoma of the face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms appear. Aggravation of the development of the disease may lead to acute pneumonia, acute shortness of breath syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some patients who do not have clinical symptoms but confirm the results of the tests may not have symptoms, so specialists have advised that people who are in contact with the confirmed cases should be closely monitored to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates for asymptomatic cases range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the period between injury and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is often five days. As an example of confusion, the estimated segment of people with COVID-19 who initially lost their sense of smell was 30% and then recently fell to 15%.
Some details on how the disease is spreading are still under investigation.
It is believed that the disease spreads mainly during mixing or through the scattering of spray when coughing, sneezing or talking; when mixing at a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without mouth covering may result in a spray scattering from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some see that the virus may also be transmitted by air-stuck spray for a long time, which may be produced while speaking. It may also produce a respiratory spray during the exhalation process, including when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted by air.
The spray may fall on the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may cause respiratory discharge to be released into the form of a spray and then cause spread through the air.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches one's eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of feces spreading to the mouth, the risk is thought to be limited.
The government of China has denied that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from feces to the mouth. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it may spread before any symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease.
People have been diagnosed with the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating the possibility of transmission before the onset of severe symptoms.
There are only a few reports of cases without laboratory-confirmed symptoms, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing surveys.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) asserts that despite some uncertainty about how easily the disease spreads, one person can infect from two to three more in general. The virus remains on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been confirmed to have been infected with covid-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, yet British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, as when touching other surfaces that an infected person may have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who were suffering from pneumonia in contact with a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 shares all of its properties with the coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, home soap kills the virus, as its protective membrane dissolves. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have an animal origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus meets the genus coronavirus beta, and falls under the subgenre of the coronavirus sarabi (B strain) as well as two strains originating from bats.
96% match the level of the entire genome with other samples of coronaviruses in bats (Baat Cove Rat G13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of genome sequences between viruses created by squamous ant eater and human-generated viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome so far has led to the discovery that 92% share at most of the genetic material between squamous ant-eater coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, an insufficient proportion to prove that squamous ant-eater is the intermediate host of this virus.
The virus can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although the confirmation is ultimately done by the reversible replication polymerase reaction (RRT-PCR) of the infected secretions or computerized tomography.
A study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography indicated that computed tomography is more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or as a preliminary examination for the diagnosis of the disease."
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, for the first time on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on samples of the respiratory system or blood.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
This test is generally done with a nasopharyngeal swab, and a swab of the throat can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them have been proven accurate enough to be widely used.
A serological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use in the United States only in accredited laboratories.
The imaging properties of CT radiographs and CT scans for people with symptoms of the disease include asymmetrical peripheral opacity such as misty glazing and a blurred crystalline leaching.
The Italian Society for Radiation gathers an international online database of imaging results for confirmed cases.
Radiography without a polymerase chain reaction is a limited-precision procedure with regard to the detection of COVID-19 due to its interference with other diseases such as adenoid virus infection.
A large study in China compared the results of a CT of the chest and polymerase chain reaction and proved that although imaging is less accurate in terms of evidence of infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it is a screening tool in endemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus imaging in both radiographs and computed tomography.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining good personal hygiene in general, washing hands, avoiding contact with the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and using a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and getting rid of it after that by throwing it directly into the trash.
Those who already have the infection are advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Physical spacing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Several governments have banned unnecessary travel from and to countries and regions affected by the outbreak or advised against travel.
However, the virus has reached the point of spread throughout society in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus spreads within communities, and some individuals do not know where or how they have been infected. Health care providers, who take care of a person who is likely to be infected, are advised to use significant measures and mingling precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an effective way for health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent its spread.
The use of GPS data by governments for the purpose of tracking has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement demanding that such surveillance be restricted.
As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen specialized groups have worked on privacy-sensitive solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record how close a user is to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they approach a person who has been shown to have been infected with the virus. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are promoted; for example, washing your nose and gargle with mouthwash is not a viable solution.
There is still no vaccine for covid-19, although many organizations have been working on a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when dirt appears on the hands, before eating, and after emptying the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because household soap kills the virus outside the body; it destroys its protective membrane.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several disinfectants (within one minute of applying the disinfectant to the stainless steel surface), including: ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and iodopodone 0.2–7.5%.
Other antiseptics, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that when a person is suspected or confirmed to have been infected in a facility as an office or care center, all places such as offices, bathrooms, shared spaces, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control devices and ATMs used by the patient should be sterilized.
Health organizations have recommended that people cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, either bend the elbow and place it in front of the mouth and nose, or use a tissue paper and get rid of any tissue immediately.
Those who may be affected are recommended to use medical masks, as wearing the mask reduces the amount of respiratory spray and the distance it travels when it is scattered due to talking, sneezing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the desire of [people] to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if the hands are not properly cleaned." It is recommended that people who take care of people who are likely to develop the disease use masks.
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk of injury, such as those taking care of a loved one, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage ordinary people to wear face masks.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially in the case of contact with people (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less) directly.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a medical mask when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health officials encourage individuals to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out to public places without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear masks when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has obliged anyone who enters a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked commuters on trains and intercity buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama has made wearing a face mask when going out necessary, while also recommending that facial masks be manufactured at home for those who cannot buy face masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social spacing (also known as physical spacing) involves infection control measures that aim to slow the spread of the disease by minimizing mixing between individuals.
Roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, exchanging greetings without contact, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments currently impose or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if the spread of COVID-19 in the region was not detected) to 50 people, and 10 people later.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older people and those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and weakened immune systems face an increased risk of serious diseases and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in outbreak areas between communities. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health bodies began replacing the term "social spacing" with the term "physical spacing", to show that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social ties, either by default or at a distance.
The use of the term "social spacing" has led to the suggestion that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than being encouraged to communicate with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
This includes recommendations not to have sex except with someone you live with who is not HIV-positive or has symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people with covid-19 and those suspected of infection.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Several governments have imposed or recommended self-seizure for all residents living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions were issued to those of the most vulnerable.
Those who have dealt with a person with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where the infection is widely transmitted by self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last exposure have been advised.
The strategies for controlling outbreaks are containment or curbing and limiting the spread.
Containment is applied in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected people as well as introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When containment becomes impossible, efforts are then directed to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be done both at the same time.
Repression requires stricter measures to reverse the course of the pandemic by reducing the number of primary reproductions to less than 1. Part of the management of infectious disease outbreaks attempts to reduce the peak of the epidemic, in what is known as flattening the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of straining health services and provides more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may address outbreaks include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and self-quarantine; community actions aimed at physical distancing such as school closures and cancellations of large gatherings; community solidarity to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Stricter measures have been taken to contain outbreaks in China once the severity of the outbreak has become clear, such as the application of quarantines to entire cities and the imposition of a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also taken a variety of measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus.
South Korea has introduced mass screenings and local quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of the injured.
Singapore has provided financial support to those injured who have isolated themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and criminalized hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations of Great Britain and the United States show that mitigating (slowing the spread of the epidemic rather than stopping it) and curbing (reversing the growth of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies may reduce the peak health care demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and straining health systems.
Curb may be preferred but must be maintained as long as the virus spreads in humans (or until the vaccine becomes available, if this occurs first), as the transition on the other hand bounces back quickly when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to rein in the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications and drinking fluids and rest may help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Many pre-approved compounds for the treatment of other viral diseases are subject to screening for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also reported that some "traditional and home remedies" could provide relief for symptoms caused by SARS-Covid-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care centers to provide for the needs of patients with COVID-19 has been described by the World Health Organization as essential measures to respond to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to transfer resources at multiple levels, including the focus of laboratory services on the COVID-19 test, the elimination of elective procedures as possible, the separation and isolation of people with COVID-19, and increased intensive care capacity through staff training and an increase in the number of respirators and beds available.
There are multiple theories as to where the first case originated (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Wuhan wholesale seafood market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says the virus came from one of these species; in other words, it has an animal origin. A group with pneumonia was observed for an unknown reason on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jisian at Hubei County Hospital, who informed the CDC of Jianghan Puhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Police alerted eight of these doctors, including Li Wen Liang, to spread false rumors, and another doctor, Ivin, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Enough unknown cases of pneumonia have been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan, prompting them to start investigating in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases was doubling approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus moved to other Chinese provinces, with the help of navigating during the Chinese New Year and for Wuhan being a transportation hub and the main railway junction point.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The official data released later shows that 6,174 people have already developed symptoms by January 20, 2020. As of March 26, the United States has surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 people dying and more than 364,000 recovering.
At least 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted freedom of movement and imposed border controls.
National reactions included containment measures, such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, take-away orders, or closures) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, have undergone a form of closure in the United States, more than 50 million people have undergone closures in the Philippines, some 59 million people have undergone closures in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people have undergone closures in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide underwent one form of closure, a number that rose to 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was on November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jisian observed a range of cases of pneumonia caused by unknown on December 26, and subsequently informed her hospital of the Center for Disease Control in Jianghan Puhan on December 27.
An initial genetic test of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated a SARS-like coronavirus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice on December 31.
The World Health Organization was informed on the same day.
With these notices, doctors in Wuhan have been warned by police about "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of a person-to-person transition.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping later described as a "popular war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as the "largest quarantine in human history", a health cordon was announced on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which has spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei and affected about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city has been banned.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were cancelled in several places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Hooshinshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Another hospital was then built, the Leichenshan Hospital, to deal with additional patients.
In addition to newly established hospitals, China has also turned 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into makeshift hospitals. On 26 January, the government took other measures to contain the outbreak, including providing health announcements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools have also been closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have taken several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote action measures have been taken in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were imposed inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums have been temporarily shut down across China.
Control of the public movement has been tightened in several cities, with an estimated 760 million people (more than half of the population) exposed to one form of exit restriction. After the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from being "bringed" to it from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine on all returnees to the city from other countries. On March 23, one case moved locally in mainland China over the past five days, via a traveler returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stated that the spread of locally transmitted infections and control of outbreaks in China has receded.
Restrictions on travel in Hubei were eased the same day, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the closure was imposed. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the suspension of entry of visa holders or residence permits from March 28 onwards, with no specific details as to when this policy would expire.
Those who wish to enter China will be required to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged companies and factories to resume work on March 30, and offered a cash incentive package for companies. The State Council announced a three-minute silence on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the central government demanded that families show their respect online in order to avoid a further outbreak of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 transition from China to South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency announced a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely due to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Jesus Church.
The Shincheonji followers visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 people or about 13% of 9,336 church followers reported symptoms. South Korea reported its highest alert levels on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed three soldiers were infected with the virus.
Flight schedules were also affected, and then changed. South Korea implemented a program that was considered the largest and best-organized in the world to screen people for the virus, isolate any infected as well as track down their contacts and quarantine them.
The screening methods included mandatory personal reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals via the mobile app, testing of the virus on people inside their cars, with test results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is a success in controlling the outbreak despite the lack of quarantine for entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's removal, alleging the government's mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On March 23, it was announced that South Korea had the lowest total cases in a single day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that as of April 1, all new arrivals from abroad will be subject to quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests from 121 different countries to help test the virus.
Iran reported its first confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case on February 19 in Qom, where two people died later the same day, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, Friday prayers, the closure of universities, institutes of higher education, and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani stated that there is no plan to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals will be isolated.
Plans to limit intercity travel were announced in March, although heavy intercity traffic continued ahead of the Persian New Year.
The Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became the epicenter of the spread of the virus after China.
Amid allegations of Iran’s cover-up over the outbreak, more than a dozen countries tracked their cases from Iran as early as February 28, suggesting that the extent of the outbreak could exceed the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
Iran's parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have been infected by the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release eligible prisoners.
It stated that there is a high risk of the spread of the virus in enclosed spaces such as detention facilities, which also lack adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government announced 100 deaths in one day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 Iranian politicians and current and former government officials died of the disease by March 17.
By March 23, Iran was recording 50 new cases per hour, and one death every ten minutes from the coronavirus.
According to a World Health Organization official, the number of cases in Iran could be up to five times higher than reported.
U.S. sanctions on Iran are also believed to affect the state's financial capacity to respond to the virus outbreak.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has called for the relief of economic sanctions on the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed in Italy on January 31, when SARS-CoV-2 tests of Chinese tourists in Rome came positive.
Cases began to increase sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unrelated group of cases was later discovered, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on February 21. On February 22, the Council of Ministers announced a new law to contain the outbreak, including a quarantine for more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "In and out of the outbreak zones will not be allowed.
It has already been ordered to suspend work activities and sporting events in those areas." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities across the country where deaths in Italy amounted to 100 cases.
All major sporting events, including first division football matches, were scheduled to take place behind closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were suspended in full for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all business activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesiology, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China as the country with the highest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after 3,405 deaths were reported due to the pandemic.
On March 22, Russia sent nine military aircraft carrying medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which were in the Lombardy region.
The CNN report indicated that a combination of a large number of elderly people and the inability to test all those infected with the virus so far in Italy may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as the most lax among the affected countries, and as of March 18, 2020, the UK government has not imposed any form of social distancing or comprehensive quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement advising against unnecessary travel or social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid several places, such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On 20 March, the government announced it would close all recreational facilities such as bars and gyms as soon as possible, promising to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to £2,500 a month to reduce unemployment at the time of the crisis. On 23 March, the prime minister announced stricter social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and activity outside the home except for extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were implemented by the police by issuing fines and dispersing gatherings.
Most companies were ordered to shut down, except for "necessary" businesses, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, petrol stations, and garages.
On January 20, the first known case of the coronavirus-19 was confirmed in Washington, D.C., northwest Pacific, by a man returning from Wuhan on January 15.
The White House Task Force against the Corona virus was set up on January 29.
On January 31, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and imposed restrictions on entry of travelers from China.
On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own testing group.
Despite doing so, the United States slowed down the test, blocking the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The test damaged a flawed test kit produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government for non-government test kits (by academia, corporations, and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for the test until early March (the doctor's order was then required).
By February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported, "Many people who experienced symptoms and had a doctor's order waited hours or days for testing." After reporting the first death in the United States in Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a procedure that was soon followed by other states.
Schools in Seattle cancelled schooling on March 3, and by mid-March, schools across the country were closed. On March 6, 2020, the U.S. was informed of expectations regarding the impact of the novel coronavirus on the country by the University of Imperial College London epidemiologists.
On the same day, President Trump signed the Corona Preparedness and Response Supplementary Appropriations Act, which provided emergency funding to federal agencies worth $8.3 billion to respond to the outbreak.
Companies imposed travel restrictions on employees, cancelled conferences, and urged employees to work from home.
Sports activities and seasons were cancelled. On March 11, Trump announced travel restrictions for most of Europe, except for the UK, for 30 days, effective March 13.
The next day, the restrictions were extended to include the UK and Ireland.
On March 13, he declared a national emergency, which allowed federal funds to be used to respond to the crisis.
As of March 15, many companies have shut down or reduced their working hours across the U.S. in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.
By March 17, the epidemic had been confirmed in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia. On March 23, 10,700 cases of coronavirus were reported in New York City, more than the total number of cases in South Korea.
On March 25, the governor said social distancing appeared to have been a success, with estimates showing a slowdown in cases from 2.0 days to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, there were 32,308 confirmed cases in New York City, and 672 people died from the virus. On 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States, and 12,841 people died.
According to media reports on March 30, U.S. President Trump decided to extend social distancing guidelines until April 30.
The same day, USNS Comfort, a hospital ship with about 1000 beds, docked in New York.
On April 3, the United States recorded 884 deaths from the coronavirus within 24 hours.
In New York state, the number of cases exceeded 100,000 on April 3. The White House was criticized for underestimating the threat and controlling news circulation by directing health officials and scientists to coordinate public data and publications related to the virus with Vice President Mike Pence's office.
The Trump administration has not been universally acclaimed for the crisis, creating widespread polarization among parties.
Some U.S. officials and commentators have criticized the U.S.'s reliance on imports of essential materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns has been used to map and predict deployment patterns and was published in the Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on information from IATA 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the highest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne have also been reported as popular destinations for travelers from Wuhan.
Bali was reported to be the least capable of more than 20 popular destinations on alert, while cities in Australia were considered the most capable. Australia released its emergency response plan for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on February 7.
It said little had yet been discovered about the COVID-19 virus, and that Australia would stress border and communications surveillance in its response to the pandemic.
On 21 March, a biosecurity emergency was declared for humans in Australia.
Because public transport has been affected by the effective quarantine in Wuhan and Hubei, several countries have planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the region, primarily through charter flights from their home countries, with Chinese authorities providing permits.
Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany, and Thailand were among the first countries to plan to evacuate their citizens.
Pakistan has announced that it will not evacuate any of its citizens from China.
On February 7, Brazil evacuated 34 Brazilians or family members as well as four Poles, a Chinese person and an Indian citizen.
Polish, Chinese and Indian citizens disembarked from the plane in Poland, where the Brazilian plane stopped before resuming its route to Brazil.

On the same day, 215 Canadians (176 from the first plane, and 39 from a second plane hired by the U.S. government) were evacuated from Wuhan to Canadian troops base Trenton to be isolated for two weeks.
On February 11, another aircraft carrying 185 Canadians landed from Wuhan at the Canadian Trenton Air Force base.
Australian authorities evacuated 277 citizens on February 3 and 4 to the Christmas Island detention centre, which was re-used as a quarantine facility, where they stayed for 14 days.
A New Zealand evacuation flight arrived in Auckland on February 5, and its passengers (including people from Australia and the Pacific) were isolated at a naval base in Wangabarawa, North Auckland.
On February 15, the United States announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the cruise ship Diamond Princess.
On February 21, a plane landed in Trenton, Ontario, carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, an aircraft from South African Airlines chartered by the South African government returned 112 South African citizens.
A pre-departure medical examination was conducted, leaving four South Africans with signs of the coronavirus to mitigate the risk.
South Africans whose test results were only negative were returned.
The test results proved that South Africans, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission who, as a precaution, remained under surveillance and quarantine at Ranch Resort for 14 days, uninfected.
On March 20, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq because of the pandemic.
On February 5, China's Foreign Ministry reported that 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad, Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China.
Some Chinese students at U.S. universities joined forces to send aid to areas infected by the virus in China, and a joint group in the Greater Chicago area reportedly managed to send 50,000 N95 masks to hospitals in Hubei province on January 30. Direct Relief, in coordination with FedEx, sent 200,000 face masks with other personal protective equipment, including gloves and hospital staff clothing, via an air emergency bridge, to Wuhan Union Hospital by January 30.
On February 5, Bill and Melinda Gates announced a $100 million donation to the World Health Organization to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts, along with protecting "at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia."
Intraxion reported that the Chinese government donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on February 6, after Senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan.
On February 19, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send China $2.26 million in aid.

After the cases settled in China, the country was sending aid to various countries affected by the pandemic.
In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical supplies and experts to help Italy deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Businessman Jack Ma sent to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits, which he distributed to the African Union.
Later, 5,000 test kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators were sent to Panama.
Ma also donated medical supplies to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and test kits made in China.
For example, Spain withdrew 58,000 of China-made coronavirus test kits, which were only 30% accurate, and in the meantime, the Netherlands returned 600,000 of China-made face masks that were defective.
Belgium returned 100,000 unusable face masks believed to be from China, but they were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, parts of Latin America and Africa welcomed receiving Chinese aid well. On April 2, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of obfuscating prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, with the central government providing "regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday."
On January 23, in response to the central authorities’ decision to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gooden-Galia noted that while it was “definitely not a recommendation made by the World Health Organization,” it was “a very important indication of a commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated,” and described it as “unprecedented in the history of public health.” On January 30, after confirming the transition from one person to another and increasing the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international interest (PHEC), the sixth case of public health emergencies of international concern since the first resorting to this action during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
The WHO Director-General said that considering the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern is due to the "risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have strong health systems."
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "the World Health Organization does not recommend limiting trade and mobility."
On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic funds prepared in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "don't have systems to detect people with the virus, even if it appears."
Tedros also made statements declaring that "our strength is measured by the strength of the weakest person in us" and urging the international community to "invest today or pay a high price later." On February 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the disease, in a press conference, the name of COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the potential of the entire UN system to respond."
As a result, a UN crisis management team has been set up, allowing the coordination of the entire UN response, and the WHO will allow it to “focus on the health response while leveraging the expertise of other agencies to learn about the wider social, economic, and developmental impacts of the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a WHO-led joint mission team was set up with China to provide on-the-ground international and WHO experts in China to assist in local management and assess the "intensity and portability" of the disease by hosting workshops and meetings with key national institutions, and to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at the provincial and city level, including urban and rural areas." On 25 February, the WHO announced that "the world must do more to prepare for the potential coronavirus pandemic," noting that it was too early to describe it as a pandemic, but states should be "at the stage of preparedness".
In response to the spread of the outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that a global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", the highest level it has to warn and assess the risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on earth: so we have to prepare.
This virus may be on its way and you have to prepare for it," he said, urging correct response measures that can help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that current data does not justify public health officials declaring the disease a global pandemic, saying such a declaration means "we fundamentally accept that every human being on this planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the World Health Organization is "deeply concerned by the alarming levels of prevalence, severity, and alarming levels of inaction." The World Health Organization has faced severe criticism for what is seen as inadequate treatment for the pandemic, including delayed public health emergency declarations, and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people as of April 6.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts affirmed respect for the rights of everyone during the pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and the government bears this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not be justified in discriminating against a particular group.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced, homeless, living in very poor conditions, detainees, as well as refugees and other non-specific groups in need of government support.
Intergovernmental organizations address the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The OECD has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as perspectives and advice.
Among the policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of closures and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a state policy tracking tool, designed to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove, and Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro's son Edward Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
A number of CPC directors have been dismissed across several sectors for their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move was aimed at protecting Communist Party of China (CPC) Secretary General Xi Jinping from public discontent over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Legian, have previously refused to acknowledge that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories claimed by the United States or Italy regarding the coronavirus-19.
The Donald Trump administration has called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China "imposed a blackout on the news that has exacerbated the virus, which is now a global pandemic," which some critics have criticized for being racist "and distracts [from] its administration's failure to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast received a U.S. government cable reviewing the communications scheme with clear sources on the National Security Council, stating a strategy that "everything is about China.
We have been asked to seek and disseminate these messages in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances." News sources such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of a "geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through the practice of circumvention and generosity policies".
China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner," Borrell said.
China has also called on the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the last two countries.
U.S. sanctions banned the donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba on April 3.
U.S. authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other countries.
There have been mask-related disputes reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizzo Massari, Italy's ambassador to the European Union, said: "It is only China that has responded at the bilateral level.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin equipped the Russian military to send military medics, special cleaning vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an unnamed "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of initiating a striking "geographical and diplomatic political" attack.
Lombardi President Atilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the press reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane carrying medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when providing assistance to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when U.S. manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are active again, they will also be able to give back if necessary."
NATO's planned military exercises "Defenders 2020" will take place in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO wargame since the end of the Cold War on a narrow scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the training of the 2020 defender, saying: "In light of the current public health crisis, the training not only endangers the lives of troops from the United States and many of the participating European countries but also the populations of the countries that will take place." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about twenty members of parliament as well as 15 former or current political figures injured.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help, saying his country was struggling to fight an outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak sparked calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other rich countries, including universal health care, comprehensive child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "mysterious and negative quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined at certain government sites for two weeks.
South Korean society was initially polarized by President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon's removal because they claimed the government had mishandled the outbreak or praised his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency-related legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that this could allow governments to tightly control power.
In Hungary, parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has led to many supply shortages, has been blamed for the growing global use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption of factory operation and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings about a shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and the suspension of suppliers.
Many areas also saw panic buying, which led to empty shelves of basic groceries such as food, toilet paper, and water bottles, causing a shortage of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection tools has doubled by 100 times.
This demand led to prices rising up to twenty times the normal price and also caused medical supplies to be delayed for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protection tools around the world, with the World Health Organization warning that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Diego shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
Activity led to a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government. Despite widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent high demand for food products, the two regions survived a severe food shortage.
The measures taken by China and Italy to combat the storage and illicit trade of vital products have managed to avoid severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen its large agricultural output decline significantly, but prices could rise according to the expectations of industry representatives.
Food shelves were temporarily empty, even in Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to hold stocks for such emergencies.
China felt the damage to the global economy: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy was severely damaged in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the government to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and industrial hub, it has been noted that the outbreak of the virus poses a significant and destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agatha Demaris expects the EIU to keep markets volatile until a clearer picture of the possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the pandemic on global growth could exceed that of the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated the global supply chain was affected by more than $300 billion that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has reportedly experienced a "disruption" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to a drop in demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant rise in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock indices, including the Nasdaq-100, the Standard & Poor's 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recorded their biggest decline since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, its largest one-day decline since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indexes ended the week down by more than 10%.
On February 28, the GMBH Scoop confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained negative expectations.
Stocks fell again due to fears of the coronavirus, and the biggest decline was on March 16.
Many believe an economic recession is possible.
Economic expert Mohammed Al-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by central banks and countries in a timely manner.
Central banks respond faster than they did in the wake of the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the travel ban, the closure of public places including tourist attractions, and the warning of governments to travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline, Flybe, collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at an unprecedented level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Spring Festival travel season known as Chunyun, the main travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
National and regional governments have cancelled a number of events featuring large crowds, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent large gatherings, including Beijing's Forbidden City and traditional temple galleries.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, in municipalities and regions of China, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised the level of infectious disease response to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, schools were closed until March and New Year's celebrations were cancelled. The retail sector globally was affected by the reduction in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This also led to a 33–43 percent drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America more likely to suffer this situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in the interior provinces, or in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The shutdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid through daily wages) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have suffered some form of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have been employed in Spain since its closure in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a comprehensive credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their workers in government-backed short-term work plans known as Korzarbet.
France and Britain adopted a short-term German work compensation plan.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations as well as individuals – both workers and independents – globally.
The arts and culture sector institutions have sought to support their mission (often funded by the government) to provide access to the cultural heritage of society, to preserve the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, venues, and other cultural institutions have been closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, there have been extensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Among the other rapid recent repercussions of the disease were the abolition of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals, concerts, technological conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a break. The Vatican announced the abolition of the Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian season of repentance in Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians stay at home instead of attending Sunday Mass; some churches have made church services available via radio, live broadcast or television while others offer worship without leaving their cars.
With the Roman Catholic diocese in Rome closing its churches and the church chapel, and the evacuation of St. Peter's Square from Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also abolished limited public services and gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, synagogues, temples, and gourduras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest imbalance in the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 European League, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 National Hockey League season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start at the end of July, and the IOC announced on March 24 that the event "will be rescheduled beyond 2020 but no later than the summer of 2021". Gambling clubs and other venues around the world were closed and live gambling tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new subscription rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or canceling concert tours.
Many big theaters like those on Broadway have suspended all shows as well.
Some artists have discovered ways to continue producing and sharing work online as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live-streaming parties or creating online "festivities" for artists to perform, distribute and publish their work.
Many internet memes have spread about the coronavirus as much has turned to humor and entertainment under uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, extreme prejudice, xenophobia and racism have been observed against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hot spots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when the majority of cases were still confined to China) documented racist sentiment expressed by various groups around the world towards the Chinese that they deserved the virus or received what was allegedly justified punishment.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also seen a rise in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination because of their regional origin.
There has been support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for those living in areas affected by the virus.
After the outbreak spread to new hot spots, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan hashtag is released.
The Chinese as well as other Asians in the UK and US have reported rising levels of racial abuse, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus," a term that critics have considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine have attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China and is studying in major Indian cities, have faced harassment over the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party unit in West Bengal, Dilip Gush, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God avenged them."
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the remarks, calling them "wrong". In China, the pandemic has led to an increase in xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents, with foreigners described as "foreign garbage" and targeted "to get rid of them."
Many newspapers have removed subscription-paid pages for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available scientific papers related to the open access outbreak.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes ways to detect the presence of the virus as it recognizes antibodies that produce a response to infection.
RT-PCR confirms the presence of viruses in the samples, where it detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is accurate and only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active cases.
Antibody detection (synthetic) is used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people got sick, including those whose symptoms were so simple that they weren't reported or who didn't show symptoms.
The exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of mass immunity among the population can be determined depending on the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country in March 2020 had reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population.
On 23 March, no country examined more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant variation in the number of tests conducted by different countries.
This discrepancy is also likely to significantly affect reported case mortality rates, which are likely to be greatly overestimated in some countries.
Using an intraday polymerase chain reaction for reverse transcription (RRT-PCR) can perform the examination on respiratory samples obtained in different ways, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RTP-PCR, which is performed with throat swabs, is only used in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For people who are tested in the second week, a sample of deep airways can instead be taken with a suction catheter or coughing substance (phlegm).
One of BCR's early tests was invented at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the RTR-PCR reaction, and formed the basis for 250,000 test kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech also created a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit suitable for safe clinical use and based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its own new coronavirus-2019 diagnostic panel based on the instantaneous RT-CR on public health laboratories through the International Reagents Provision Authority.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits resulted in inconclusive results due to defective detectors, and one phase of the test was delayed from another at CDC in Atlanta; this led to the completion of an average of less than 100 samples per day throughout the entire month of February 2020.
Tests using two components of trust were not until 28 February 2020 and government and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, Lab Corp. announced the availability of the COVID-19 test across the country depending on the RT-PCR.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics has made available the COVID-19 test across the country as of March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions have been announced; samples must be drawn and processed in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the State Center for Virology and Biotechnology Research invented and produced the Victor-Test-Kovide-19.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Health Care Service recorded the test. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the coronavirus-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on large numbers, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization (EWA) to Abbott Labs for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration had previously granted a similar permit to Holec, Lab Corp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Seifed received similar emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in favor of a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a test that uses the technique of amplifying even-heated DNA instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of successive temperature cycles, this method can show positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase manufacturing to conduct 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is also developing a test that uses a monoclonal antibody specifically linked to the nuclear cap protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, hoping to be able to achieve results within 15 to 20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A review of studies in March 2020 concluded that "radiological images of the chest have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT results may be clear even before symptoms appear."
The usual characteristics that appear in computed tomography include multi-lob bi-sided opaque glass opaques with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution.
The spread under the pleurisy develops and irregular patches appear and intensify as the disease develops.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to compute tomography in relation to the origin of the current pandemic indicated that computerized tomography is more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with many of its imaging properties interfering with pneumonia and other pathological stages.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography to detect COVID-19 or as a preliminary examination for the diagnosis of the disease." In March 2020, the CDC recommends using PCR for the initial examination.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
It can be used to detect injury to individuals within a period starting from 7 days or after symptoms appear, to determine immune capacity, and in the case of population monitoring. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by clinical care point testing (BOCT).
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the rate of production per system.
For central laboratories, a single sample of peripheral blood cells is usually used, although successive samples can be used to follow the immune response.
For the clinical care point test, a single blood sample is usually drawn through the skin hole.
Unlike BCR methods, the extraction step is not required prior to examination. On 26 March 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 29 entities that provided the agency with notification as required, so that they could distribute their antibody tests.
On 7 April 2020, the FDA adopted only one test under emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics obtained European accreditations in favor of their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
The test is completed several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can often be detected 14 days after the start of the infection. In early April, the UK discovered that the antibody test kits it bought were not good enough to be used.
Hong Kong has developed a plan under which patients suspected of being infected can stay at home, "giving the emergency department a sample tube to patients", spit in the tube, and return it back to get the test result after a short period of time. The NHS has announced that it is testing a plan to test for suspected cases at home, eliminating the risk of transmission from infected people when they come to the hospital or the need to sterilize the ambulance used. When conducting a COVID-19 test for suspected cases without leaving the vehicle, the health care professional pulls out the sample taking appropriate precautions.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians expressed on March 2 that it had been able to carry out about 12,000 tests per day for outpatients and underwent 10,700 people for testing last week.
Health insurance will bear the costs if a doctor orders the test.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of about 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, in-vehicle virus detection tests were available in several major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was not known, as only positive case results were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study revealed that starting from the 12/2020 calendar week, at least 483,295 samples were tested until the end of the 12/2020 week, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, Technion researchers and Rambam Hospital devised a method of examining samples taken from 64 patients at the same time and subjected that method to testing, by collecting samples and not conducting further tests unless the group sample was found to be positive. In Wuhan, BGI opened a temporary laboratory for emergency detection of 2000 square meters in the name of "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火 眼 or "Fire Eye" in English) on February 5, 2020, which can examine more than 10,000 samples per day.
With Wang Jian, founder of BGI, overseeing the construction work and taking 5 days to do so, modeling has shown that cases in Hubei would have risen by 47% and the associated quarantine costs would have doubled if that testing capacity had not been accomplished.
Wuhan lab has followed the establishment of Huo-Yan laboratories immediately in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai and in 12 cities in total across China.
By March 4, 2020, total daily productivity was 50,000 tests per day. Origami Assays released open-source and multi-transmission designs that can test up to 1122 samples for a patient to detect COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for automated fluid treatments.
In March, the shortage and inadequacy of detectors caused a dilemma when conducting a large number of tests in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This prompted some specialists to explore sample preparation protocols that include heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE is at the top of the world in terms of its population's coronavirus testing rate, and is on its way to raising the level of testing to most of the population.
This was through a combination of activating the in-vehicle test capability, and purchasing a super-productive lab with a population-friendly range from Group 42 and BGI (depending on their emergency detection labs "Huo-Yan" in China).
The lab was established within 14 days, allowing tens of thousands of RTPCR tests per day and is the world's first laboratory of this size to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods have been devised targeting different parts of the genetic features of the coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German plan to make crews sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to create their own crews.
The German plan was announced on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was not available until January 28, delaying tests available in the United States. China and the United States have faced problems with the reliability of test kits as early as the outbreak, and these countries and Australia have not been able to provide enough kits to meet the demand and follow recommendations for tests provided by health experts.
Experts say the abundance of tests in South Korea has helped curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has greatly enhanced test capacity in private sector laboratories over several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for intensifying testing programs as the best solution to curb the progress of the pandemic. The increased demand for testing as a result of the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to accumulate in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents was scarce.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, "defects" were found in the test kits created by the CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that specifically prevented the test. Spain bought test kits from Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Ltd., but found the results to be inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results may be due to the failure to collect samples or the failure to use the kits properly.
The Spanish ministry said it would back off buying the kits that gave incorrect results, and replace them with other test kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed dumping it into the Danube. Professor Ach Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health reported that test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and had "prevented their use". The UK also purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but at the beginning of April 2020 declared them unusable.
The tests, followed by a quarantine for those who were found to have been infected and followed by those who had contact with SARS-CoV-2, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Fu, which saw the first death of a covid-19 in Italy, conducted tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people twice, taking about ten days at a time.
Almost half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were isolated.
As a result of the ban on movement between towns, new injuries were completely eliminated.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has seen a significant decrease in prevalence compared to other developed countries, but without such strict restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and retail facilities by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine.
Several events have been cancelled, and Singapore has already begun urging residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after the holiday.
Several other countries have also taken control of the pandemic by strictly tracking contacts and imposing restrictions on internal travel, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent closure decisions, such as in Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has revealed that countries that have done more tests, compared to deaths, have significantly lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are able to detect only mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have the ability to conduct tests or have local laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send the first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO-certified laboratories to confirm the test.
Of the 16 accredited laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the "% positive" column is affected by the policy followed by the state in conducting the test.
Only a country that conducts tests for people admitted to hospital will have positive cases higher than the country that conducts the test for all its residents, whether they appear to have symptoms or not, as other factors are equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning hands for the purpose of removing dirt, grease, micro-organisms or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap at certain "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral anal route.
People can also develop respiratory diseases such as the flu or cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five necessary moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's butt or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry, and after.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before preparing food, during it, and after it.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing a baby's diaper or cleaning it after using it for the toilet.
After cleaning your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching the animals, their feed, or their waste.
Hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices associated with medical procedures.
Hand washing before giving medications or providing medical care can prevent or limit the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or diseases.
This is especially important for people who deal with food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important procedure for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases, preventing diarrheal infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
Lower infant mortality rates at home.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to minor improvements in height growth in children under five.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by approximately 50%.
Measures that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrhoea seizures by nearly a third, similar to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of low diarrhoea episodes can be associated with washing hands with soap. Handwashing with soap is the only effective and least expensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARIs) when automatic behavior is applied in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main acute respiratory infections, is the number one cause of death among children under five, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together cause about 3.5 million children to die each year.
According to UNICEF, turning handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhoea deaths by almost half, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (water, sanitation and hygiene) programs.
Hand washing also protects against herpes transmitted through direct physical contact.
Hand washing is a simple harmful effect that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition of peeling and itching known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health care workers.
Hand washing is also often seen more than it should be as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the transmission of diseases through the oral anal route: after using the bath (wetting, defecating), after cleaning the baby's butt (changing diapers), before feeding, before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
The correct hand washing method should be practiced in other cases in order to prevent transmission of the disease, including before or after treatment of a cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or cleaning your nose, after touching or handling animal droppings, and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing is reduced by soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate of 97 percent, and the United States is close to the middle of 77 percent, and in China with the lowest rate of 23 percent. There are now many approaches to behavior change to increase the use of handwashing with soap at the necessary times. Group handwashing for school children at specific times of the day is an option in developing countries to establish a habit of handwashing in children's behaviors.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented by the Ministry of Education in the Philippines is an example of taking widespread action to promote children’s health and education.
The treatment of worms twice a year, in addition to daily hand washing with soap, and daily dental cleaning with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Adding soap or detergent to the water promotes the removal of micro-organisms from the skin.
The main effect of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstructions of decomposition, increase the solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective antiseptic for the skin because fats and proteins, which are the components of organic soil, do not easily decompose into water.
However, an adequate amount of water flow helps to cleanse.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may carry bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A few studies that have observed the bacterial transition from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transition is unlikely because bacteria are washed with foam.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still states that it is "preferably the use of liquid soap from touchless devices to pump soap."
Antibacterial soap has been heavily promoted to health-conscious consumers.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of disinfectants or recommended sanitizers is chosen to eliminate antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soap has common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which does not affect a large number of strains of organisms.
So, if antibacterial soap does not affect antibiotic-resistant strains, it may not be as effective as it is marketed to it.
Besides reducing surface tension and skin protection factor, advanced formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as an acidic regulator, active antimicrobial benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (cactus, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soap is as effective as triclosan-containing anti-inflammatory soap in preventing diseases and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water suitable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, warm water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural oils that retain dust and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect in reducing microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a substance that is not water-based to clean hands.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-water-based alcohol hand cleaners sterilized through rubbing (also known as handwashes with alcohol composition, handwashes with disinfectant or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or compound ethanol with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in liquid, or foam for ease of use and reduce the effect of alcohol-induced dehydration.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Alcohol-containing hand sanitizers are at least 60 to 95% effective bactericidal.
Alcoholic sterilisers through rubbing eliminate bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (golden staphylococcus resistant to methicillin and vancomycin-resistant intestinal staphylococcus), tuberculosis, some viruses (including HIV, herpes, respiratory cell virus, nasal viruses, arch, influenza, hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol sterilizers containing 70% alcohol through rubbing eliminate 99.97% (a logarithmic decrease of 3.5, similar to a decibel decrease of 35) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after placement and 99.99% to 99.99% (a logarithmic decrease of 4 to 5) of the bacteria on the hands 1 minute after placement. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against noroviruses (or noroalc), which is the most common cause of gastroenteritis caused by infection. Enough hand sanitizer or rubbing alcohol should be used to wet or completely cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands are rubbed between all fingers and limbs for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel dries.
Fingertips should also be thoroughly washed and rubbed at both comforts. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with hand sanitizer, especially when the hands are clearly dirty.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and their rapid activity in eliminating micro-organisms; however, they should not be an alternative to proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Repeated use of alcohol hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients, skin moisturizers or both are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol in dry skin can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients or both to the formula.
Clinical trials have shown that alcohol hand sanitizers containing emollients cause less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Atopic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome, alcohol hypersensitivity, or additives found in handwashing substances rarely occur.
Reduced susceptibility to irritant contact dermatitis has become an attraction compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Despite the effectiveness of detergents that are not water-based, they do not cleanse the hands of organic matter, but simply sterilize them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of an alcohol-free hand sanitizer depends heavily on ingredients and composition, and historically it has had a significantly lower impact than that of alcohol-based rubbing.
Recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a cumulative and persistent effect as an antimicrobial after use, unlike alcohol that has been shown to be less effective after repeated use, possibly due to progressive reverse skin reactions.
Many individuals in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or dirt instead.
Ash or dirt may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if dirt or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, they may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Ash, too, like soap, is an antiseptic agent because it forms an alkaline solution when it comes into contact with water.
The World Health Organization has recommended the use of ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The correct handwashing method recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
It is recommended to use running water because existing basins may be contaminated, and at the same time the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Make foam on the hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of the hands and between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands thoroughly when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and removes rubbing for longer periods of time more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinse hands inside the pelvis may re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let it dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are easily contaminated again. The most common parts that are overlooked are the thumb, wrist, interfinger areas, and under the nails.
Industrial nails and cracked nail polish may contain microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent dry hands, dry skin can lead to damage, which can increase the risk of transmission.
Different low-cost options can be provided to facilitate hand washing in developing countries, where tap water, soap or both are not available, such as pouring water from a hanging pot, knocking through suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary. In places with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to rationalize water consumption, such as a "Tipe Tap" and other low-cost options.
Tippi tap is a simple technique that uses a jug hanging from a rope, a foot-operated control arm to pour a small amount of water on hands and a piece of soap.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
A growing number of research suggests paper towels are healthier than electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study, sponsored by the European Textile Symposium on the Paper towels industry, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, warm air hand dryers, and newer jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the soles of the fingers by 194 percent and on the palms by 25 percent.
The drying with a jet air dryer increased the average total number of bacteria on the soles of the fingers by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on average on the inside of the fingers decreased by up to 76% and on the palms by 77%, and the scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there is a possibility of transmission to other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet air dryer, which pushes the air out of the unit at speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and device, and may infect other toilet users and the bathroom environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of a warm air dryer deploys microorganisms within 0.25 meters of the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative while traveling due to the lack of soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory for a long time after Hungarian physician Agnats Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide notes to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found low rates of infection using it.
Medical hand washing will be for at least 15 seconds, using abundant amounts of soap, water or gel to make foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together and fingers tangled.
If there is litter under fingernails, a brush with rough hair can be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse them thoroughly and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids contamination of the hands again from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing at a health care place is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and avoid their transfer.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, transporting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent, and the World Health Organization has published a newspaper explaining how to wash and rub hands in the health care sectors.
The guidance document project for hand hygiene provided by the organization can also be found on its website available for public comment.
Whitby and others conducted a related review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if necessary to demonstrate compliance with regulations.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five moments to wash hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
before the sterilizing task, and
After taking care of patients. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medical" or "antimicrobial") adds a pesticide to the handwashing agent.
This element of extermination may be desirable before surgery or in places where antibiotic-resistant organisms are heavily spread. When someone's hands are "scrubbed" for surgery, a faucet that can be operated on and off without being touched by hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine washes, sterile hand-drying towels after washing, a sterile brush for rubbing, and another sterile tool for cleaning under nails is required.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually from 2 to 6 minutes.
Long rubbing time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsing, water should be prevented from the forearms to the hands.
After washing hands, the hands dry with a sterile cloth and wear a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after taking care of a sick person.
To control staphylococcus infection in hospitals, the biggest benefit of manual disinfection was found to have come from the first 20% of the laundry, and it gained very little additional benefit when the frequency of hand cleaning increased to over 35%.
Regular soaping results in more than three times the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to antibacterial soaping. Comparing hand rubs with an alcoholic solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds, rubbing alcohol was found to reduce bacterial contamination by 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol hand washes to reduce H1N1 influenza virus and hard-to-finish bronchial spores. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating staff about hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol hand washes, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
More research is needed to find out which of these measures is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as an essential tool at an affordable cost for good health, as well as good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap, or handwashing facilities in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it difficult to come up with general handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa you rarely find hand washing taps near each private or public toilet, although there are cheap options for building hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can be caused by ingrained habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and advocating handwashing with soap can affect political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term change in population behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community approaches are effective in increasing hand washing in middle-income countries than in the lower-middle-class, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of promoting hand washing in schools is the "three-star approach" that UNICEF designed to encourage schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other health requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can move from one star until they reach the ultimate three stars.
Building handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns to reduce diseases and child deaths.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising campaigns trying to bring about a change of behavior. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji for handwashing.
Few studies have considered the effectiveness of the overall cost of handwashing in developing countries and their relationship to disability-adjusted years of life.
However, one review suggests that strengthening handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation measures.
For the first time, the importance of handwashing for human health – especially for people in critical conditions such as mothers who were just born or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygiene pioneers: Hungarian physician Agnats Simmelweiss, who worked in Vienna in Austria, and Englishman Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.
Most people at the time still believed that the infection was caused by unpleasant odors called miazmaz.
In the 1980s, food-borne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more effectively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries of the importance of handwashing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, posters containing the "right ways to wash hands" were hung next to hand wash basins in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
Handwashing from" means something that one does not want to take responsibility for or engage in complicity in.
It stems from a passage in the Bible in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but became a phrase of much wider use in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth play, Ms. Macbeth begins to wash her hands excessively in an attempt to cleanse a fantasy-making spot of guilt for the crimes she committed and the crimes she urged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after referring to or thinking about immoral acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to appreciate handwashing tools more often.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after this study are less likely to participate in other "purge" compensation measures, such as volunteering.
Religions describe handwashing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water without handwashing soap, is part of a ritual of handwashing that has emerged in many religions, including the Baha'i, Hindu, and Tefelah doctrine, handwashing in Judaism, and washing in Christianity and light in Islam. Religions also require healthy handwashing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam impose hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam impose handwashing before and after each meal.
Controls of the risk of COVID-19 in the workplace
The workplace risk control controls are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for risk control controls to prevent the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The correct workplace risk control controls are based on the location of the job and the job task, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the risk of disease in the community, and the risk factors for working individuals who may be at risk of developing COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work involves minimal contact with the public and other coworkers, a condition in which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account coughing and sneezing etiquette, and maintaining the usual practices for cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Functions with moderate exposure risk include those that require frequent or close contact with individuals who are not known to be infected or suspected of having been infected with COVID-19, but may be infected by ongoing transmission in the community or international travel.
This includes workers who have communicated with the general public as in schools, labor-intensive and high-volume work environments, and some large retail venues.
Risk control controls for this group, as well as basic infection prevention procedures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing prevention barriers, and the use of personal protective equipment available in the case of dealing with a person with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSH) considers health care workers and a dead body keeper who are exposed to a known or suspected person who has been infected with COVID-19 at a high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of extremely high exposure if workers are carrying out aerosol generation procedures, collecting samples from a known or suspected person who has been infected with or treated with COVID-19.
The appropriate controls for risk control for these personnel include engineering controls such as passive pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment suitable for the job.
Cases of outbreaks of COVID-19 can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, in terms of both the quality of goods ordered, and the ways they are obtained (such as shopping in non-peak hours or via delivery services or shopping without leaving the vehicle).
Finally, shipments of goods from geographies severely affected by COVID-19 may stop. The infection-causing disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors for individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
It also sets out the controls to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national and sub-national recommendations.
Targets to respond to the outbreak include reducing the transmission of infections among employees, protecting people most at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
A risk control hierarchy is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to classify risk control controls by effectiveness.
Because the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without relying on workers' behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implementation.
Administrative controls are changes to a business policy or procedure that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (BPE) is less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected based on the risk to the worker, the correct fit as appropriate (e.g. breathing devices), the wear continuously and properly, the inspection, maintenance and replacement regularly, as necessary, the removal, cleaning and storage, or properly disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs that include less risk exposure involve minimal contact with the public and other co-workers.
Basic procedures for preventing recommended infections of all workplaces include frequent and full hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, taking into account coughing and sneezing etiquette including covering the mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, providing paper napkins and garbage containers, preparing for remote work or organizing shifts of work if necessary, dissuading workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of potentially contagious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until fever and fever signs and any other symptoms go away for at least 24 hours without using antifever medications or other medications that improve symptoms, that sick leave policies be flexible, that allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, jobs with an average risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close communication within six feet (1.8 m) of individuals who are not known to have or suspected to have been infected with COV-19, but who may be infected with SARS-COV-2 due to ongoing transmission in the community around the workplace, or because a person has recently made international travel to a site where the transmission of COV-19 is widespread.
This includes workers who mix with the general public as in schools, high-intensity work environments, and some large-scale retail spaces. Engineering controls include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezes, installing windows to serve customers who shop without leaving the car. Administrative controls and high-risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing meetings face-to-face with virtual communications, creating successively organized work shifts, developing emergency communication plans including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing workers with updated education and training on risk factors and protective behaviors related to COVID-19, training workers who need to use clothing and protective equipment, providing resources and a work environment that induces personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, reducing customer and public access to the work site, and posting of hand washing and other COVID-19 prevention measures. Based on the job, workers may need at least average exposure to wear personal protective equipment including gloves, including gloves, or masks, or masks, or masks.
This risk group workers rarely need to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill while on an airplane, appropriate prevention controls to protect other workers and passengers include distancing the patient from others by 6 feet, assigning one member of the aircraft team to serve the sick person, providing the sick person with a face mask or requiring the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing.
The crew of the aircraft must wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching contaminated body fluids or surfaces, possibly using additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable purposes must be disposed of in a biological hazard prevention bag, and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and sterilized afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk control controls include postponing travel when ill, self-isolated and immediately informing the medical center on board if a person has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is present in the school building regardless of the prevalence in the community.
When there is a limited-to-medium community transmission limit, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings such as physical education classes, music classes or eating meals in a canteen, increasing distances between offices, organizing consecutive attendance and departure times, reducing unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission of infection in the community, in addition to social distancing strategies, school departure times can be taken into account. For law enforcement officers who carry out routine daily activities, direct health risks are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who should contact individuals who have been confirmed or suspected of being infected with COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of direct contact during arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and tools before reusing them with a spray or household cleaning wipe, follow standard work procedures to deal with pollution and dispose of the personal protective equipment used and to collect and wash clothes.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) believes that some health care workers and the dead body wallets fall into categories with very high or high risk levels.
High-risk jobs include health care workers, support, laboratories, and medical transport who are exposed to known or suspected patients with COVID-19.
This level of risk is very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures, as well as collecting samples from confirmed or suspected patients with or dealing with COVID-19.
The procedures for generating aerosols include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and tests, or invasive sample collection.
The functions of the high-risk mortuary portfolio include workers who are involved in the preparation of confirmed or suspected bodies of people who have been infected with COVID-19 at the time of their death; and those with a very high level of risk exposure if they perform an autopsy on the body. Additional engineering controls for these at-risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients with COVID-19, including when carrying out aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and the preservation of dead bodies.
Samples must be treated with Level 3 biosafety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends isolating incoming patients in separate waiting areas based on whether or not they are suspected of having covid-19. In addition to other personal protective equipment, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends the use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95-type facial mask respirators, certified by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or better devices, should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program, which includes installation testing, fitness, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve workers' comfort. The World Health Organization does not recommend the use of aprons, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted by body fluids.
The World Health Organization recommends only using a surgical mask for inspection staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect, take care of, or transport respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol generation procedures, the World Health Organization recommends using a surgical mask, goggles, a face shield, a sealant, and gloves.
If the aerosol generation procedure is performed, the face mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator mask.
Given that the global supply of personal protective equipment is insufficient, the World Health Organization recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the personal protective equipment necessary for the specific task, continuing to use the same mask without removing it while caring for many patients with the same diagnosis and monitoring the supply chain of personal protective equipment and coordinating it, and dissuading the use of masks for individuals who do not show symptoms.

We found ourselves in the midst of extraordinary circumstances this month.
The pandemic has become 19 things that clearly demonstrate the universal human interdependence and responsibilities that lie with us towards others.
Our history has never seen similar challenges, but we know for sure that the best response is based on a kind of global empathy, collaboration, and community-building, which are firmly at the heart of this institution.
The intense friendship and care we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is a stunning demonstration of the amazing human emotions that, fortunately, surround our business.
I am deeply grateful and deeply proud to have you as a true colleague.
Last week, someone sent me a message to express their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how important the world can be to Wikipedia right now, and the powerful symbolism that this crucial resource remains is available online and a kiss is available to all individuals.
Your efforts have made it possible, whether it's through the continued functioning of the sites, our colleagues getting paid, or the safety of our communities.
The world is in dire need of the information available on Wikipedia more than ever.
It is a moment when the positive impact in the world is not limited to the efforts we make, but also the way we make it.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make significant adjustments in how we work together starting next week.
Modifications to the method of work and timelines
As Robin mentioned earlier, Team C met yesterday to discuss our method and schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we looked at what we thought could be the appropriate response to what we are facing, and the ideal way to sustain the organization’s business during this period.
We wanted to get rid of stress and stress, and support our long-term mission.
If you want to reduce burdens and tasks, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
The expected daily working period is 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
If you are able to work longer than usual working hours, you may add your efforts to the task.
However, the world is now unpredictable, and whether you want to take care of your loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your safety is our top priority.
We don't track your times.
If you're sick, don't work.
Allowing this to happen should be understood without expressing it, but we mention it as a confirmation.
No sick leave or paid leave is required, just inform your manager and help your team review calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you have been diagnosed with HIV-19 with a positive diagnosis, please tell Brian at the Training and Certifications Department so that the Training and Certification Department can provide support and ensure that your condition is properly cared for by the department.)
Fellows working per hour receive their full pay.
We have already mentioned this, and we renew this commitment to our contractors and our fellow hourly employees.
Each employee will be paid based on normal working hours during normal circumstances.
This includes whether the employee is ill or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people are taking advantage of the work to overcome the pervasive pressures in the world around us.
What we can do will be incredibly productive, especially during stressful times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of the person for himself.
We only ask you to communicate with your manager so that they know what to expect and adjust the procedures to adjust accordingly.
Some work is necessary.
There are also some things we need to keep going.
Site reliability engineering teams, HR processes, trust and trust, and fundraising (and others) are doing critical work, which may require further support.
We will start a process of collaborating with all departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to supporting the elements necessary to achieve our mission.
There is a lot of work to be done for all of us, and we will focus on only the most important projects.
Going slower now won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "double the working time to recover what's missed" after the pandemic ends.
We are not expected to work extra hours to meet the currently unrealistic deadlines.
We accept the fact that these circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and timetables whenever this becomes appropriate.
What happens in the annual planning (APP)?
To adapt to the new reality and the expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the delivery schedule for our 2020-2021 annual planning.
We intend to propose extending our 2019-2020 plan to allow more time for budget design to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care and care for loved ones while aligning those who need to work within a reduced working hours schedule or want to, in the next few weeks.
This timeline extension eases the workloads of current planning and lobbying across the entire organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Board next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps immediately upon confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their pioneering role in this matter.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our San Francisco colleagues may have been infected with the virus.
However, out of great caution and prohibition, we employed a virus-resistant cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team has used a hospital-grade antivirus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the lobby and elevator units that lead to our floor.
The building has implemented its own duty-of-care protocol using products that support tenant safety.
We feel comfortable that the office is properly ready until the time we decide to return to work.
Our office in Washington, D.C. is located in a WeWork building, which we have shared with each and every member of our team at our Washington, D.C. headquarters.
Starting last week, our office in Washington, D.C. has moved to a remote location entirely as directed by our San Francisco office.
As some of our colleagues know at our New York City headquarters, we had a discussion about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed for some time.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that it may be a modification, and have wanted to give you some advice:
Meetings should be scheduled to last a maximum of one hour or gradually increase up to two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them over several days.
The meeting should be clearly defined, an agenda set up, and materials for reading should be sent in advance.
The video should make the default solution, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct communication.
Each meeting should be facilitated, one person should monitor the conversation for questions and track the list of speakers, and another person should help take notes (or carry out the collaborative note-taking process).
An email should be sent to technical support when comfortable headphones are needed.
The Health and Safety Compensation Program can be used to get the cost of snacks.
You can join the #remoties channel in the Slack app to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is looking for a user-friendly, meeting-based online guidance to support the increase in business distributed across our organization.
Over the past week, we have asked all community grantees to cancel all public events funded by Wikimedia, such as those of online editors Editathon, until the World Health Organization announces the end of the pandemic.
We tell them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make completing agreed grant activities impossible, and that no one will be fined for delaying or modifying these goals.
Next week, we will issue additional follow-up guidance for Wikimedia and other regional community conferences with specific topics.
Public sentiments that predominate in the global community flounder between grief due to turmoil, satisfaction with clarity and the ability to focus on their communities, Wikimedia, and others.
Moving forward with these actions, the Crisis Response Team is designing a page in Meta Wiki to provide community space to monitor the impact and monitor all communications with it.
Stay up to date on the topics associated with COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC, 07:00 Pacific Time for the staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, respond to questions, and spend time communicating with us.
We have this experience together and are always ready to help as much as possible.
In the meantime, we can continue to obtain information from this email, and all other necessary information regarding the COVID-19 available at Office Wiki.
The Crisis Response Team will keep these pages up-to-date and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contacts with workers residing in severely affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, key business areas, coverage challenges, or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to inform us and cooperate with our Crisis Response Team.
We are always ready to provide support and communication as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Brian Gooden, Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
Any such change may not be considered as a waiver of our work or obligations.
Instead, at this moment in time, our work and commitments are in a critical need to adapt to situations in a way we have not in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to support each other, so that we can continue to work, provide our workers with the support they need, and provide the world with the service they depend on.
The work we have planned to achieve will be waiting for us when it is time to do it.
Now is the time for each person to help each other and create a space for important work that will come in the coming weeks and months.
We need all of you to do this, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your families to be at your best when your efforts are needed.
Please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, Director of the Crisis Response Team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jimmy V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jimmy V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The converted enzyme Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is associated with the outer surface (cellular membranes) of cells in the lung, arteries, heart, and kidney, as well as the intestine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 counters the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing angiotensin (1-7); making it a promising drug in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is also an entry for some types of coronary viruses into cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hace2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a metal enzyme containing the element zinc and located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme protein 2 has an amino end Peptidase M2 range, and a carboxylic choline chain is a carrier of renal amino acids.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein, and has active enzymatic receptors present on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extraterrestrial part of the cell range of the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2 is separated from the transmembrane band by an enzyme called Shidaz, resulting in the release of a soluble protein into the bloodstream and then released through the urine.
Angiotensin 2 is found in most organs of the body: it is associated with the cell membrane of type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, in the intestinal cells of the small intestine, the endothelial cells of the arteries and veins, as well as in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall in most organs.
The DNA of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is present in the cerebral cortex, the schema, the hypothalamus region, and the brain stem.
The primary function of the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2 is to act as a balancer for the converted enzyme Angiotensin.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme stimulates the conversion of angiotensin 1 to angiotensin 2 astringent for blood vessels.
In contrast, the converted enzyme of angiotensin 2 separates the carboxylic tip containing the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin 2 (aspartite-arginine-valin-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine) and analyzes it into angiotensin (1-7), (histidine-aspartite-arginine-valin-tyrosine-isoleucine-histidine-proline-phenylalanine).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 separates into a number of other peptides including [dis-arginine9] - pradirequinine, abeline, neurotincin, dynorphine A, and gerline.
Angiotensin 2-converting enzyme also regulates the membrane passage of a neutral carrier of SLC6A19-equivalent amino acids, and has a role in Hartenberg's disease.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, as a transmembrane protein, is the main inlet to cells of certain coronaviruses, which include human coronavirus NL63, SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, the S1 Spike protein association of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with the enzymatic range of the ACE2-converting enzyme on the surface of cells leads to cellular aggregation and transmission of the virus and enzyme to the internal particles that fall into the cells.
This input process needs to be configured by a transmembrane protease enzyme, the host's serine2, which is still inhibited in the trial as a potential treatment. This makes some assume that lowering the levels of the agiotensin-converting enzyme in cells may help fight infection.
However, many specialized associations and self-regulating bodies recommend continuing to use the usual angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers as a treatment.
A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was accompanied by a clear reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34% compared to the reference group.
Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia among people who received treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and who were more at risk for pneumonia, especially those with stroke or heart failure, decreased.
The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors has led to a decrease in the proportion of deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less potent compared to the overall risk of pneumonia.
It is believed that the recombinant human enzyme rhACE2 will be a new treatment for acute lung injuries, as it has been found to improve pulmonary blood distribution, as well as oxygen saturation in pigs with acute dyspnea syndrome induced by fatty polysaccharides.
The half-life of the recombinant angiotensin 2 enzyme is approximately 10 hours, while it begins to work after 30 minutes, and its effectiveness (time period) lasts up to 24 hours.
There are many indications that recombinant angiotensin 2 may be a promising treatment for those with traditional angiotensin resonant intolerance (RAS inhibitors) and in diseases accompanied by a rise in angiotensin 2 in the blood. Clinical trials are under evaluation, for the effect of recombinant injecting the recombinant angiotensin 2 into the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications specifically designed to help track people who are in contact in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, meaning the process of identifying people (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many applications have been designed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Many frameworks have been developed to design contact tracing applications.
Many have expressed concerns about privacy, especially about systems that depend on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less invasive alternatives to privacy include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they might integrate a function that supports these Bluetooth-based apps, directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in cooperation with Alipay, has published an app that allows citizens to check whether or not they have come into contact with people with HIV.
It is an application used by individuals in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, individuals use an application called TraceTogether.
A local IT association has designed the app, released it as an open-source app and is due to be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched StopKorona!, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected individuals and provide rapid response to healthcare authorities.
The Ministry of Communications and Technology, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, has taken over the design of the application.
On April 14, 2020, the app was still waiting for Apple's Google Play Store and App Store to be approved.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking app was in advanced development and could become available for distribution within weeks. Ireland and France plan to launch a similar app, StopCovid.
Australia and New Zealand are both considering designing applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether application, as well as the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to roll out an application that uses the geographic virtual perimeter of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from Moscow, which is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has mentioned a number of potential practical problems surrounding application-based systems, including false positives and a possible lack of effectiveness if application use is limited to only a small segment of the population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "Coronavirus" applications, Apple has imposed restrictions on the types of organizations that can add their associated applications to its App Store, limiting it to "official" or other reputable organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance resulting from the use of coronavirus applications, particularly with regard to whether surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will go away once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
The organizations also announced eight conditions for government projects:
Monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
Monitoring and monitoring extensions should include items relating to when they are stopped;
The use of the data should be limited to the purposes related to COVID-19;
Data security and the confidentiality of the identity of its owners should be protected and proven to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalization;
Any sharing of data with third parties in the law should be determined;
The protections against abuse and the protection of citizens' rights should be made available to address abuse;
Effective participation is required from all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the ongoing monitoring problem by removing the tracking mechanism from hardware operating systems as soon as they are needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking rather than application use, eliminating both the need to download the app and allowing tracking to be avoided.
In Israel, officials have adopted network-based tracking.
But network-based solutions that have access to raw data for sites have potentially significant privacy issues.
However, not all centralized server systems need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use centralized servers for intercoms only (see the next section below).
In South Korea, officials have used a non-application-based system to carry out contact tracing.
Instead of using a custom app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and includes this data to send text messages to individuals with potential infections.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information publicly available, which it has allowed due to wide-ranging changes to the information privacy laws following the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, have considered the use of centralized systems and the preservation of privacy.
On April 6, 2020, details on this matter have not yet been released.
Tracking privacy-supplied contacts is a successful concept and is supported by powerful research literature dating back to at least 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts worked to reach privacy-compliant solutions, such as low-power Bluetooth (PLE) to record user proximity to other cell phones.
However, BEP-PT was a coordinated effort that contained both centralized and decentralized approaches, not an individual protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized approach tracking (DP-PT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, formerly known as call event numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and contact tracking mechanisms (BACT) among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data does not leave the device, and all matching processes occur on the device.
MIT Media Lab's privacy group was developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-preserving technologies when collecting or cross-tracking location data and making use of them to track the spread of COVID-19.
Based on the research of the report "The Wicked Face of Applications: Maintaining Personal Privacy Under the Epidemic" released in March 2020, Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that also originated in MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and administrators without compromising data privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global Contact Number Tracking Coalition was founded by groups whose focus was on what was essentially a similar approach and heavily overlapping protocols, whose goal was to reduce dispersion and enable global interchangeability between tracking and alerting applications, a key feature for widespread use.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had made the Blue Tres protocol, which is used by the official government application, open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the two companies that control Android and iOS mobile operating systems, announced an initiative to track contacts, claiming that they will maintain privacy based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving encryption.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the goal is to roll out the system in three phases:
Offering tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving applications to track the coronavirus
Incorporate this functionality directly into Android and iOS as Google and Apple plan to resolve ongoing usage and monitoring issues by first distributing the systems via OS updates and then removing them in the same way once the threat is over.
Real estate repositioning (also known as re-use, re-allocation, goal change or therapeutic transformation of the property) is the re-use of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than originally designed to treat it.
This is a method of scientific research that researchers are currently pursuing to develop safe and effective treatments for covid-19.
Other research trends include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of fibromyalgia plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 drug-treatable proteins, each of which has multiple binder sites.
The analysis of these linked sites provides a reasonable plan on the development of an effective antiviral drug that eliminates COVID-19 proteins.
Among the target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are two-door-like proteases, RNA polymerase based on RNA, helicase, S protein, and RNA phosphates of adenosine biphosphate.
Hussein A., et al., has studied several candidate compounds that then underwent improvement and analysis for the similarity of their structure to approved drugs with the highest similarity and this is for the purpose of accelerating the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his pre-clinical study to recommend it in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is a malaria medication that doctors also use to treat certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and associated chloroquine could be among four drugs studied as part of a clinical solidarity trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that New York State trials on chloroquine and chloroquine hydroxy may begin on March 24.On March 28, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of chloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use License (EWA).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and was licensed under an emergency use license only as an emergency use treatment for patients who entered the hospital but are unable to receive treatment in the clinical trial.
CDC has announced that it has not yet determined "the use of chloroquine hydroxy to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, doses or period."
Doctors said they use the drug when "there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is currently conducting a small study on the use of chlorquine in addition to zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York Langon School of Medicine conducts an experiment on the safety and effectiveness of the protective use of chloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have claimed that Faviparavir was "clearly effective".
Of the 35 patients in Shenzhen, the test results were negative in an average of 4 days, while the disease period was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them were given vapiravir and the other half received omifinovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has alerted people that the existing evidence supporting the drug is incomplete and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the property from Japan to include it in its reserve stock, and would use the military to deliver the property to university hospitals, where the property would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning newspaper, Shinzo Abe had preliminary talks with the Trump administration about buying the property.The drug may be less effective in treating the most severe cases where the virus has already doubled.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women who wish to become pregnant.
One study that used lobinavir/ritonavir (Calitra), an antiviral combination of lobinavir and lobinavir, reported that the results "did not detect any benefit."
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV to prevent it from being copied by binding it to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to reach a compound associated with the SARS-CoV-2 protease.The scientific community is witnessing a case of criticism about redirecting resources to redefining the purposes of drugs specifically designed to treat HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has added Lubinavir/Retonavir in the international solidarity experience.
Gilead Sciences has developed remedicvir as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences has since discovered that remedicvir is active antiviral in vitro against many nematodes, mucous viruses and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through transformations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-clinical studies suggest that remedicivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several current clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one is for people with moderate disease, and the other is for patients with the most severe disease.
There are three clinical trials of antiviral vitamin C in patients who have been hospitalized with acute illness due to COVID-19, as well as two controlled trials of placebo use (China, Canada) and an uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State has begun trials on the effect of the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Center for Public Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to carry out a clinical trial on the use of Alesco (Cyclesoned) produced by Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to treat patients with the novel coronavirus before symptoms appear.
A Phase II trial using a form of ACE2 is currently underway on 200 patients who are required to join the trial of acute conditions that have been hospitalized in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying Colchicine's role in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named after Kolcorona, includes 6000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms without having to go to hospital.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women or those who do not have an effective contraceptive are not eligible for this.
Many anticoagulants are also tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is currently widely used to treat patients, which requires the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on its use.
A multi-center study in Italy was announced on 300 patients to investigate the use of sodium enoxaparin in doses for disease prevention and therapeutic doses on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has focused on the reuse of approved antiviral drugs designed to deal with past outbreaks such as the Mars virus, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Specialists recommend using ribavirin for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th version of the Chinese directive
Omiphenovir: Specialists recommended the use of Omiphenovir for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th version of the Chinese directive
Some of the antibiotics that specialists have identified as reusable as treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tucelizumab (anti-interleukin receptor 6): Accredited by China.
Experiments in Italy and China as well. See Tucelizumab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a presumptive vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
Although no vaccines have been completed for clinical trials, many attempts are underway to develop the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
There were five vaccine candidates in the first phase of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The requirements of the Coalition on Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for Vaccine Development, announced in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity and widespread deployment and global access.
In April, Coalition scientists on pandemic preparedness innovations reported that 10 different technical platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the main platform that progressed to the first phase of safety studies include:
DNA (DNA and DNA) (phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (phase 1 developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, type 5 adenovirus carrier)
According to coalition scientists on pandemic preparedness innovations in April, there are 115 total candidates for vaccines in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 other projects announced, but with little public information available (assumed to be in the planning or design phase).
Phase I and II trials perform a preliminary safety and immunology test, usually randomized, placebo-controlled, and in multiple locations, with more accurate and effective dosages.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including the reference group, and a test of vaccine effectiveness for disease prevention, while monitoring the negative effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidate vaccines under active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet under human evaluation (still under research "before clinical").
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, aiming to start testing in humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Haneke Schweitmeecker, announced that they had started working on the development of a vaccine.

In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
Partners have also announced plans for pre-clinical and phase-one clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated cases, and that even as the pace of action accelerates it would take at least one and a half to nearly two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, reported that it was developing a particle similar to the coronavirus, partially funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is subject to laboratory research, with human testing plans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money" for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to participate in the development of a vaccine based on the transmitted RNA.
The RNA-based vaccine, the BNT162, is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company, announced that it would receive pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and the final candidate vaccine could begin testing in humans by the fall.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations (CEPA) announced the investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, leading the total investment of the Coalition on Epidemiological Preparedness Innovations in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Coalition partners on pandemic preparedness innovations for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing in animals for six different candidate vaccines.
Imperial College London researchers announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-inflated RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on anti-covid medical measures, including several candidate vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago Initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another outbreak of the coronavirus.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported tests for PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine for covid-19 in mice, where they reported that "subunit vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 given microscopic acupuncture provoked strong responses to specific antigen antibodies [in mice] that were evident from 2 weeks after vaccination."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based candidate vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using phage, the hypoxic RNA will be designed for reincarnation within human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to the virus, which may stimulate the immune system to produce SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called nonspecific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they are struggling with.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specific animal models of COVID-19, such as genetically modified mice with the converted enzyme Angiotensin 2, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, suggests the need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to deal with live viruses, and international coordination to ensure uniform safety measures.
Anti-SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccines have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no preventive treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no approved vaccine against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.
When March spread, existing research on SARS was thought to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and treatments against the March-Cove infection.
As of March 2020, there was one Middle East Respiratory Syndrome vaccine (based on hypoxic RNA) that completed the first phase of clinical trials in humans, three other vaccines under development, all of which were HIV-oriented vaccines, two HV-guided vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-guided vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts raised the conspiracy theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 was known and that the vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by many social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS-causing coronavirus.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
The period between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million people were reported injured in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during mixing, often by spray scattered when coughing, sneezing, or talking.
When spray is sprayed during exhalation, it usually falls on the ground or on surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People may also get infected when touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it may spread before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the instantaneous reverse polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) through a nasopharyngeal swab.
Masks are recommended for those suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, some authorities recommend not to use them, some see otherwise, and others have to be used.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
They may not show symptoms on people with the virus or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, coughing, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Immediate medical attention is recommended if there are emergency symptoms of difficulty breathing, constant pain or pressure in the chest area, disorder, difficulty waking up, or glaucoma of the face or lips.
In less common cases, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be observed.
Symptoms of the digestive system such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in varying proportions.
Initially, some cases in China suffered from chest tightness and palpitations only.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those with symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports suggest that symptoms may not appear on all infected people.
The role of the carriers of the disease has not yet been fully recognized without symptoms in transmission; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asymptomatically asytomatically asymptomatically in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began listing asymptomatic cases within the daily toll on April 1; of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic.
Sputum and saliva may carry large percentages of the virus.
Speaking loudly results in more spray than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore has shown that coughing without mouth covering may lead to spray scattering up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transmitted by air, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that it can be transmitted by bio-aerosols, and testing samples from air collectors in the lobby outside of individual rooms has yielded positive results for viral RNA.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and CPR may trigger respiratory discharge in the form of a spray, and then the virus spreads through the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, it is thought that the risk is limited.The virus is more contagious when people experience symptoms; while it may spread before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that despite some uncertainty about how easy the disease is to spread, one person can infect from two to three others in general. The virus remains stuck on surfaces from hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to remain present for one day on cardboard and for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on copper (99 percent).
However, this varies based on humidity and temperature.
Soap and disinfectants are also effective on condition that they are used properly; soap dissolves the virus' protective fatty membrane and stops its action, as well as ridding the skin and other surfaces of it.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken after an average of two days of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and on the second day of the test, the sixth patient showed the highest viral load.
SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome, first isolated from three people who were suffering from pneumonia in the combination of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus shares its characteristics with related coronaviruses found in nature.
Outside the body, home soap eliminates the virus, destroying its protective membrane. SARS-Cove-2 is closely related to the original SARS-Cove.
The lungs are the two most affected members of the covid-19 because the virus enters the host cells by the converted enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the alveolar cells of type II found in the lung.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "Spike" (volve coupon) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
12% of people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China suffered severe heart attacks, and were more common in critical cases.
Cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute heart muscle injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors have a very important role in the heart and are involved in performing its functions.
The rate of clots (31%) and venous blood clots (25%) in patients in the intensive care unit with covid-19 has increased, which may be linked to poor predictability of the condition.The autopsy of individuals who died from covid-19 was found to be widespread senile damage (DAD), and inflammatory leaching containing lymphocytes within the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is directed towards epithelial cells expressed by ACE2 in the respiratory tract, severe COVID-19 patients experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, T-cells that secrete pathogenic GMCSF have been shown to be associated with bringing in the only cells that secrete inflammatory interleukin 6 and metastatic lung disease in patients with COVID-19.
It was also reported that there was a lymphatic lesion at the autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The instantaneous reverse replication polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the standard method of testing.
The test is usually done using respiratory samples taken from a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires taking two blood samples by two weeks and the results are of simple direct value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and spread genetic sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop PCR tests to detect the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experiment on the test showed that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its first clinical care point test on March 21, 2020 for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines from the Zhongnan University Hospital suggested ways to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risks.
Multi-lob bi-lateral cataracts with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior propagation are common features at the beginning of the injury.
A spread under the sideline and the form of a stone alignment (thickness of the lobular septum with an uneven alveolar filler) may appear and merge with the development of the disease.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and covid-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological conclusions of autopsies:
Microscopic examination: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung enlargement and pulmonary edema
Four types of the severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, hyperplasia of pulmonary cells, large, non-typical alveolar cells, interstitial inflammation with lymphatic filtration and the formation of multi-core giant cells
Acute Pneumonia: Diffuse Sankhe (DAD) damage with Diffuse Sankhe secretions.
Diffuse alveolar damage causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute hypoxemia.
Treatment of pneumonia: regulation of secretions in the alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukocyte reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eye, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, and advises using the inner part of the attachment if a napkin is not available.
It is recommended to clean your hands thoroughly after any cough or sneeze.
CDC recommended the use of clothed face coverings in public, in part to reduce asymptomatic transmission.Social spacing strategies aim to reduce the mixing of people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public gatherings.
Spacing guidelines also include people moving at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
There is no known drug for its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19. Since no vaccine is expected to be invented until 2021 at the earliest, the main part of the control of the COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, which is known as the "flatness of the curve."
CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when the hands are clearly dirty, before eating, and after cleaning the nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It is also recommended to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, when soap and water are not only available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulations for local production.
Antimicrobial activity in these two combinations arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an effective hand disinfectant."
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People receive supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organ support.
CDC recommends that those suspected of contracting the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
It is recommended for personal hygiene and to rely on a healthy lifestyle and diet to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may benefit those with mild symptoms during the early stage of the injury. The World Health Organization (WHO) and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations to care for those hospitalized for COVID-19.
U.S. intensive care and pulmonologists have compiled treatment recommendations from various bodies into a free resource, a critical care book available online.
As of April 2020, no specific treatment has been available for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen as the first treatment.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that may result in a spray, such as intubation or manual breathing.
For healthcare professionals taking care of people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) as well as standard precautions, mingling precautions and airborne disease precautions. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (BPE) during a pandemic.
Recommended tools: personal protective equipment aprons, a respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Breathing devices (rather than face masks) are best used as soon as they are available.
The N95 respirators were approved for industrial facilities, but the Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of masks under the Emergency Use License (EWA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a particular biological agent is uncertain in the case of uses for other unspecified purposes.
When masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of face protectors, or homemade masks as the last solution.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so degraded as to require artificial respiration or replacements, but some cases need to be.
The type of respiratory support provided to those with respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 for those in hospitals is actively studied, with some evidence of the possibility of avoiding intubation using a high-flow nasal cannula or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these options works for those with a critical condition or not.
Some doctors prefer to continue using gaseous respiration whenever it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Critical cases are more common among older people (those over 60, especially those over 80).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for the population, restricting the health system's ability to cope with the sudden rise in the number of cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
One study in China found that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed artificial respiratory support, and 1.4% of cases died.
In China, nearly 30% of those hospitalized due to COVID-19 end up in intensive care units.
Artificial respiration becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in people with COVID-19 and oxygen supply becomes more difficult.
Respirators need to have high pressure control and positive exhalation pressure to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
High positive end exhalation pressure may not be available in older respirators.
The search for potential treatments began in January 2020, and many antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedesiver seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, many of the drugs that are being tested have already received approval for other uses or are already in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tried on people with a critical condition.
The World Health Organization has recommended volunteers participate in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license to use convalescence plasma as an experimental treatment in situations where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
He did not undergo the necessary clinical studies to prove that he was safe and effective against the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are required to enter the name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'callers' using surveillance data and thus the risk of possible infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analytics use mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence to track infected people and those who have mixed them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled the security services to track mobile data for those who assume they are infected with the coronavirus.
The measure was taken to impose quarantine and protect those who may be in contact with the injured citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for research purposes and to prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has used facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italy's regional health commissioner, Giulio Galera, said mobile phone companies had told him that "40% of people are still on the move everywhere".
The German government conducted a 48-hour weekend hackathon involving more than 42,000 people.
The President of Estonia, Mrs. Kirsti Kalyolaide, has also made a global call for innovative solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may be distressed by quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of injury itself.
The BBC has published a quote by Rory O'Connor: "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic stagnation is a massive storm that is detrimental to people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may take a mild course that involves minor or asymptomatic symptoms, as it resembles other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract such as the cold.
Minor cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be more likely to be severely infected with covid-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is still a lack of data on covid-19.Covid-19 may affect the lungs in some people causing pneumonia.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop rapidly in the most severely affected population, leading to respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
6% of people with covid-19 who were hospitalized were diagnosed with blood clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in the time of prothrombin, while 4% had impaired kidney function.
Approximately 20-30% of people with covid-19 have shown elevated levels of liver enzymes (mine carriers).
According to the same report, the average period between the onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five days were hospitalized.
However, the average period for those transferred to the intensive care unit between hospital admission and death was seven days.
In a study of early cases, the average period from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, and at the total level of cases was six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male mortality rate was 2.8% while the female mortality rate was 1.7%.
Postmortem tissue anatomical examinations of lung samples show widespread genomic damage with cellular fibromexide secretions in both lungs.
Changes in viral cytopathy have been observed in alveolar cells.
The lung image shows acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Heart damage was observed due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest in 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China.
According to data released by the United States in March, 89% of those who were hospitalized had previous cases. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation of the region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of deaths from the condition vary as a result of these differences between regions, but also because of systemic difficulties.
A reduced inventory of minor cases may lead to an increased estimate of mortality from the truth.
However, the fact that previous cases have caused death may indicate that the current mortality rate is lower than the truth.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care and death than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has revealed a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some patients recovering from the disease, and lung tests have indicated damage.
This may also cause post-care intensive syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether or not the previous infection was gaining people recovering from the disease effective and long-lasting immunity.
Immunity gain is seen as possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it was announced that there were cases of recovery from COVID-19 and then it was later contracted.
These conditions are thought to worsen if the infection persists more often than when it is repeated.
The virus is believed to be natural and of animal origin, given the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was largely due to its human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of covid-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that December 1, 2019 was the first date of onset of symptoms.
Official WHO publications reported that December 8, 2019 was the first date of onset of symptoms.
Many measures are usually taken to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are affected by the size of the tests, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, and the time taken since the outbreak began and the characteristics of the population such as age, sex, and public health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) within the 10th ICD Emergency Code U07.1 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 deaths clinically or epidemiologically without confirming the virus infection. The death rate is divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a given period of time.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the mortality rate of cases (CFR), which is the percentage of those who have been diagnosed and died from an illness, and the rate of infection deaths (IFR), which is the percentage of those who have been diagnosed and those who have not been diagnosed and those who have died from an illness.
These statistics do not have a time frame, and they also follow a specific population from injury to the fate of the condition.
Although antibodies may not be produced by the bodies of all infected, their presence may provide information about the number of infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castelloni de Ada, a small village with a population of 4600, 80 people (1.7%) have already died.
In Ganglet, the disease was spread due to carnival festivals, and passed to young people, causing a relatively lower mortality rate, and probably not all deaths from COVID-19 were officially classified as the result of it.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exhausted.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate varies between men and women.
The mortality rate is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The maximum risk for men is 50 years of age, with the difference between men and women having faded at only 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent in men and 1.7 percent in women.
The exact causes of these sex differences are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Immunological differences based on gender, and the lack of smoking among women and the incidence of concurrent conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the injured were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track gender-disaggregated data for COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The highest percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are at increased risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease is "Covid-19".
WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explained that Ko is an abbreviation for Corona, abbreviated to Viral Disease and 19 refers to the year the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (such as China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming recommendations aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the terms "CoV-19" and "CoV-19" in public data.
The disease and virus are commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus".
During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as the "Coronavirus" and "Coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended the use of the two names novel coronavirus-2019 and acute respiratory illness associated with novel coronavirus-2019 as temporary names for the virus and disease in accordance with the 2015 guidelines that prohibit the use of sites in the names of diseases and viruses.
The two official names, COVID-19 and SARS COV-2, were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to limited capacity in standard supply chains, digital industrial companies export healthcare materials such as nose swabs and respirator parts.
One example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier could not deliver on time, a local startup reverse-engineered it and released the required 100 valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories and misinformation emerged regarding the origin, scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
Humans seem to be able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of the virus multiplying in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There are no approved medications or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government institutions, academic groups, and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a "Solidarity Experience" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds that are most effective and promising.
No vaccine is available, but different bodies are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoV are used because it resembles SARS-CoV-2 in the use of ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to study.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete vaccine for the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to provoke an immediate immune response in the human body against a new infection with covid-19.
The second strategy, the micro-unit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to some of the micro-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the Spike S protein that helps the virus break into ACE2 receptors.
The third strategy is DNA vaccines (chromosomal DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for vaccine innovation).
The experimental vaccines resulting from any of these strategies must be tested for safety and effectiveness.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-based prophylaxis has been referred to as a potential challenge facing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine innovation, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway starting in April 2020.
Seven trials have already been evaluated for malaria, including four studies involving chloroquine or chloroquine.
Antiviral drugs proposed to be reused in the treatment of the new disease make up most of Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials on remedesiver across several countries scheduled to be reported by the end of April.
A dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and potential COVID-19 properties was conducted as of April 2020. Several existing antiviral properties are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remedicivir, chloroquine, lobenavir/ritonavir, and lobenavir/tunavir combined with interferon beta.
There is preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of remediasiver, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remedicivir for euthanasia.
Phase III clinical trials are conducted in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, formerly used for malaria treatment, was studied in China in February 2020 and has preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a peer-review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Viral Research Institute notes that despite recommending a dose of one gram, the weakness of this dose is very serious and may cause death.
On March 28, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued a license for emergency use of chloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of treating doctors for people with COVID-19. The 7th version of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin, or amiphenovir for use to treat COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
I recommend further study of the effect of nitazoxanide on living organisms after proving inhibition of the low concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that initial preparation of the Spike protein via transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRS2) is necessary to enter SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with the future of ACE2.
Studies of chloroquine and chloroquine with or without azithromycin involve significant deficiencies that prevented the medical community from accepting these treatments without further study.Oceltamifer does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
A cytokine storm may be a complication in the late stages of acute COVID-19.
There is evidence that chloroquine hydroxy may have anti-cytokin storm properties.China's National Health Commission added to the treatment guidelines after completing a small study.
It undergoes a non-random phase 2 test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in those with severe conditions.
In addition to being used to test ferritin in serum to determine cytokine storms, it aims to counteract such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some people.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has adopted interleukin-6 receptor antireceptor T-cell therapy for the Khmer antigen, based on retrospective case studies to treat steroid-responsive cytokine secretion syndrome that has a different cause in 2017.
So far, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tosylisumab is an effective treatment for cytokine secretion syndrome.
The method of transport of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of recovering people from COVID-19 is subject to those who need them to study as a non-vaccine method of passive insemination.
This strategy was tested on SARS and its results were inconclusive.
The neutralization of the virus represents the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibody therapy can act as a medium of defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity based on antibodies, phagocytosis or both may be used.
There are other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as the use of manufactured monoclonal antibodies, under development.
The production of hypothalamus serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies to this virus, can be increased faster.
Corona virus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wen Liang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was subsequently injured and died of COVID-19 after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
