Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about the similarity of the "Mapetovs"
Some members of the assembly have been discouraged by the proposal to change their title to the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this could become the subject of ridicule.
A Labour member of the assembly said his group was concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means feces.
A member of the parliament from the political party, Plaid, said the group was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "open" about the name change, but noted that there was little difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a draft law on the introduction of the name change, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the members of the assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh government's 2017 law gave the assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in a major support for the Welsh Parliament's appointment.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has given priority to the name of members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the option of MWP has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the assembly are reportedly making alternative proposals, but efforts to reach a consensus could give a headache to President Elina Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft law on changes within weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other amendments to the way the Assembly operates, including the rules on disqualification of the members of the Assembly and the plan of the commission system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour represents the acquisition of its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Đorđe Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the change is simply a price they have to pay for membership in the EU and NATO.
The bells on St. Martin were silenced as churches in Harlem struggled to survive.
The older people I talked to said there used to be bars and churches on every corner," Adams said.
There's no one else today.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
People are different today," he said.
Bars are no longer the neighborhood's living quarters where people go regularly.
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, sooner or later, he will return to where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who will not help to preserve the remaining neighborhood shrines.
The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why the closure of these churches will accelerate because it's unlikely that people who move into these apartments will become members of those churches.
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became the Black Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that worshiped nearby took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on the 125th Street, a major trading street in Harlem that opposed the hiring or promotion of black people.
In 1939, the fire badly damaged the building, but as the mayors of Johnson's father made a plan to rebuild, they ordered organs.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the organ "the bells of the poor."
An expert who played organ in July called them "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these were the world's first black musician-played organ, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to larger organ at Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said the Church of St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin's Church in recent months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom have been brought by church leaders and others by bishopric bishops.
The bishop's administration - the administrative body of the bishops, composed of church chiefs - wrote to the bishops in July, expressing concern that the bishop would "try to transfer costs" to the bishop's administration, although the bishop's administration was not involved in the lease of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishops.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the bishops.
A shark injured a 13-year-old during a lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster hunt, officials said.
The attack took place just seven hours ago near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego on Saturday that he and his friends were diving for about half an hour when he heard a boy calling for help and then took the group to him and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was an arousal for catching a lobster, but then he realized he was yelling, "She bit me!"
She's got me!
The whole key bone was torn apart," Hammel said when he reached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "The shark is in the water!"
The boy was taken by helicopter to the pediatric hospital Radi's, where his condition is being treated as critical.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Capt. Larry Gilles said in a press release that the shark had already been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also said the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the area of the upper part of the troops.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Gilles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is becoming a competition for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to department cosmetics in the style of department stores where expert assistants work.
As part of a significant £2.8 billion beauty market breakthrough in the UK, which is on the rise as sales in fashion and home furnishings markets decline, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetic products is due to supermarkets finding ways to use the shelves that were once used for televisions, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic range by offering more than 3000 products, including products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees product range will also get more space in stores similar to those in Boots.
The supermarket will also restart its Boutique makeup line by making sure that most of the products are suitable for vegans - something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test sales at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and moving to daily grocery shopping means supermarkets need to make extra effort to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's chain, said the stores would look more and more like grocery stores in a supermarket effort to hit the supply chains Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened the Argos department store in hundreds of its stores, and has also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which it says has increased sales of food products and the profitability of procurement.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to modernize their cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has ended infamy.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over the division of pharmacy revenue in their stores.
The new strategy came into force after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for £125m three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding a line of luxury skincare products to its four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty departments to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an unavoidable destination for the beauty market that sets new standards in relation to the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones "awakened" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11m deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is "raged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his personal £11m brand to focus on her deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for his home and accessories brand.
The company is compared to Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons' star Dan Peter Jones by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute - to focus on her new lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "terrible" when she admitted, during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant there was no longer time to devote to their brand of home and accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and was projected to double Willoughby's net worth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, posted her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
The source said, "Holly put her at the top of her priorities.
It was meant to be a long-term plan to secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to step down has shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There are a lot of products available for sale in Marlowe.
Experts believe the departure of the show's host, which is among Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to huge investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in launch dates.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Really with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the company in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become M&S's ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the lead on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We wouldn't be interested in his business."
Hard words, and then we fell in love.
He joked at the expense of criticism from the media for comments that could be characterized as "un-presidential" and a positive attitude about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said with his humorous voice, "The Newsreader."
I didn't give up at all.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step forward towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see an "adequate response" by the United States to North Korea's initial steps toward disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the rally.
It's going well with North Korea," he said.
We've been on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results - the suspension of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
It's easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 1000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the light in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island has been displaced, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a precondition for international assistance.
Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," she said.
While Save the Children brings together a team to travel to Palo, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Palu to see if international agencies should be allowed to participate in helping.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, it is unfortunate how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
There were no tsunami sirens on the island of Palu, although the warning was in effect, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take him at least three days to reach the site of a new crash.
President Joko Widodo has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's long-term infrastructure and failed to save money on roads and railways.
However, a lack of funding has hit Mr. Yoko's administration as he expects a new election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced by street fighting between Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored a deep tie against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to the Premier League by scoring 89 minutes on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on some 30 yards from Chelsea's goal while his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left side and then kicked it to the outside.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, turning to the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, she fell over Cape Arizabalg, who was on the jump and broke into the net.
It was only until the position, until the ball was received, and players like Shaq are always moving forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," he told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
In the fifth attack, the Blues striker added the ball to Mateo Kovacic before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool's half.
Kovacs quickly touched and returned the ball to the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and ended up close to the tripod with a left leg net outside Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool are battling Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday.
Chelsea are playing against Videoton in the Europa League at three o'clock on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll reached 832
The death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
A lot of buried people were reported in the rubble of buildings that collapsed on Friday and raised the waves of up to 20 feet high, a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is covered with the remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man, 32, after a woman was fatally stabbed.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 40-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I call everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who saw or heard anything suspicious of us.
I would also like to invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed some cameras on the car dashboards, to contact us as they may have information that is important to the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that a woman whose body was found from Birkenhead was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they are in the process of informing the family.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were told they would have to wait hours before they were allowed back in.
They heard a police officer tell a man that the entire area is considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of the crime in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."
At 14 o'clock, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next to it.
A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon overlooking the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is invited to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101, or contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, citing case 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament has become the latest monument in the midst of a dispute over the "revision of history."
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England carried out by its Puritan followers in the Taliban's manoeuvre.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's character in front of the Palace in Westminster would become the target.
Cromwell did not order or conduct iconoclasticism during the English Civil Wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of the character that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Chromwella is thought by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, to be the protector of parliament against external pressures, in his case of a monarchy.
Whether this is completely true is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the 17th-century conflict shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord of the Protectors are also worthy of fame and remembrance.
A pig killed a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, known only to be Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a pigsty on a market in the city of Liupanshui in Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig was preparing to be injected with the swine vaccine at the site of Xining in Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin in the neighboring Yunnan area on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that a pig weighing 550 litres caused death to a farmer, the report said.
My cousin's legs were bloody and dismembered," said a relative who introduced himself to Wu.
The security camera record shows Yuana arriving at the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent an attack on other people while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported before.
A pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm in 2016, causing critical injury to a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 libres enticed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife frightened and drove him away.
After the pigs ate an oregano farmer in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
They're just playing.
They like to stick, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread showers to the southwest of the U.S.
Hurricane Rosa has weakened over the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
The hurricane's winds reached a speed of 85 miles per hour of five o'clock Eastern time on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gap is forming in the Pacific Ocean and heading east and west coast of the United States. As Tropical Storm Rosa approaches Baja California on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the upcoming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the coming days.
In place, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, applications and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will result in precipitation that will reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Two to four inches of rain are expected in the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and the typical spread of tropical rain.
Walking on foot in the desert would be extremely thoughtless with the dangers of tropical rains.
Heavy rains in canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms could be caused by unusually strong winds and sandstorms.
The incoming gap will bring local showers to the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which could cause landslides and landslides.
This will be the first rainy season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, there may be severe temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder and the tropics keep warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, was nearly 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remnants of summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
The start of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures ranging from about 80 degrees south of the plains to parts of the northeast.
New York's temperature could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast predicts a high temperature above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's thrilling testimony before a high court on Thursday, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly took place in the 1980s on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political reluctance continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest plot on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake with the FBI on a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had piped and tried to split up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company has included viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty classifying people who follow the transfer from the office.
In order to do better, it's an audience similar to the one that follows a football elimination match or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose editors backed Kavanaugh's appointment, has led ahead of other networks with an average number of 5.69 million viewers over the course of a full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high even after the hearing.
Blake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters shouting at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend a hearing by the judicial commission.
He stood down for a few minutes while being insulted, with a live broadcast on CNN.
I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, there was more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks were broadcast live hours later as the judicial commission voted to pass Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the president next week, calling for a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by his conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few other senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's election was significant because it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "playing politics" over Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of Britain and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conference party in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal for the UK and the EU to take tariffs from each other was "absolutely absurd."
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson, a suspect in the death of LSU players.
Police have arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, police said.
Officials have announced arguments between the Simpsons and the Simpsons, and police say Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
Police took their glasses from the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS news channel.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
The mortuary of the eastern area of Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a shot from a gun to the head and neck.
The department said the credit belonged to a Louisiana fugitive police task force, a criminal laboratory of the state police, Southern University police and residents of the area that helped lead to the arrest.
The sporting director of the LSU Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement agency for its diligence and pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot and 6-inch shooter grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU Club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
This is what we're always worried about," Wade said.
A volcano spewing ash in Mexico City
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Protection Center warned Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were reported in 24 hours.
The center was followed by more earthquakes and thunderstorms.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police squad, when thousands joined a demonstration to mark the anniversary of a polarizing Catalan secession referendum.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special squad of police, shot them with eggs and powder paints, making dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, clashes broke out with police, who used a baton to suppress the fight.
The pro-independence supporters chanted "No forgetting, No Forgiveness" for hours, and clashed with supporters of the union who shouted "Living Spain."
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions are still high in the region, which has opted for independence a year after the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the turnout was low because opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
The pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support the national police.
Protests were held, but they changed the route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a tight spot," he said.
Although they won a key but narrow victory in the December local elections, the Catalan independence party has struggled to maintain momentum as some of its most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who filmed a protest on the phone to support police, said politicians on both sides had backed the conflict.
It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament next year.
Running in the European elections is the best way to condemn the backward democratic values and repression imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after they drove into the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly drove into a Londonerry house.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged, as was the building itself.
There is a possibility that at some point the car was shot from a self-propelled grenade.
Menge's goal brought Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal was to win for Livingston.
The improved Livingston surprised Rangers and recorded only the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 matches at the club in Ibrox.
Dolly Menge's goal was crucial, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's club has not won a single Premier League win this season and will play against the top-ranked Hearts, who are behind eight points next week.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in the Europa League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of league victories to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed out on opportunities against guests who lacked sharpness.
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored because their direct game was very difficult for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went by the goal, and Alan Lithgrove's attempt went beyond the goal after he slipped to get the ball that Craig Halkett shifted to the goal.
The hosts were asked to allow Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for free kickers.
That's how the key goal was scored.
A free kick was awarded against Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but the host's defense remained impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble.
The pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free kick to Livingston.
Crosses have consistently arrived in Livingston's penalty area and are constantly defended, while the two penalties they sought - one after a foul against substitute player Glenn Middleton, and the other for a hand-to-hand game - have not been awarded.
It's a great game, Livingston.
BBC Scotland journalist Alasdair Lamont is at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
It's a great game and the result of Livingston.
All of them were great and continued to exceed their expectations on the upward path.
Their style of play and their players have hardly changed since their return to the top, but their great credit is to Holt, who has been giving energy to the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a well-organized defense, while Meng did not give peace to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
No matter how good they were under Gerard's bat from time to time, they didn't reach that level.
They missed the final shots - they only once broke through the ranks of the hosts - and this is a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Cologne.
Saturday (September 29) was a sign of laughter and blue skies as leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at improving the relations between NATO allies.
They differed on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks live outside of Turkey.
Police cited security measures as a reason to block 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters opposed to Erdogan - many of them Kurds - were also vocal, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The double protests reflect the split in opinion about a guest who some German Turks celebrate as a hero, while others resent him for being an autocrat.
A car accident in Deptford: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 p.m.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance crew intervened, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist died in an accident in which the driver left the crash site on Childers Street, which is about a mile from the crash site.
London police said they were working to identify the victim and inform the family.
The streets were closed, buses were diverted, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Larkin Prison: Six officers injured in the riots
Six inmates were injured in high-security prison riots for men, the prison office said.
The riots broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9:30 p.m. and are still ongoing.
A special squad of Tornado officers has been called on to calm down the riots involving eight inmates in one wing of the prison.
Officers suffered minor injuries and were given help on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: "We have deployed specially trained prison staff to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Larkin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that those responsible for it will be passed on to the police and that prison sentences could be extended.
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison manager was admitted to hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special squad was called to prison for serious disturbances in which personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which may be useful in areas affected by drought)
Rarely do tropical depressions hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert's southwestern regions with its remaining energy, bringing with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Administration has already issued flood warnings for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and her arrival will be announced on Monday evening.
The National Weather Administration in Phoenix said in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest projections by the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome, Arizona, up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, it is likely to be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated areas.
In areas where there is no fear of flooding, Rosa's rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls are likely to be beneficial because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected at least by extreme drought, the second-highest category," Weather.com said in a statement.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who will still have the power of a hurricane with winds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore begin to subside.
Mexico is expected to be hit by a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The spills in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a high risk of flooding.
Total rainfall of three to six inches is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, and possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico with the power of a tropical storm before arriving in Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
The main danger expected from Rose or her backlogs is heavy rains in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These showers are expected to cause life-threatening torrential flooding in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenager was found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Officials are appealing to those who have any video of the event on their mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the anger" of the Democratic Party.
The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the democratic party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the underbelly and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago while they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly touched on Kavanaugh's appointment as he spoke about the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere.
Trump says the Democrats are trying to "resistance and interfere."
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party official told CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to rise.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them picked up by massive waves that hit the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) hit the coast at dusk, carrying many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami was declared yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not flee immediately, and they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, said in a statement.
Tsunami didn't come alone, it was carrying cars, balkans, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palu.
The aerial photos, released by the disaster agency, show a host of destroyed buildings and shops, bent and demolished bridges and a water-encircled mosque.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement Friday that the energy of the massive earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of a long, narrow bay has increased the power of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of several victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, in the Donggal area, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications were completely cut off without any information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to vulnerable areas.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticised for not reporting a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
Amateur records shared on social media show a man on the upper floor warning people on the street under a panic alert for the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the government's rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other essential supplies.
The airport is only open for humanitarian flights and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision's staff arrived safely from Donggala, Palu, where employees were housed in tents erected in the courtyard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the way, Mr Dosseb said.
They told me they saw a lot of homes destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign high-skilled humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of foreign assets, supplies and people is only possible if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
This is still a disaster on the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says 'OK, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.
As the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami falls on Palu, friends and family still hope their loved ones will be miraculously rescued and their distressing story in this natural disaster will be relieved.
On Saturday, the boy was taken out of the sewers.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been buried under the rubble of her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia's paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders ahead of the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another prisoner at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, was his students.
As an older member of the paragliding team, I carry my emotional burdens," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the downing of the Roa Roa Roa spread through the ranks of paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants who took part in the festival at the beach.
However, his messages had only one gray clutch, instead of two blue clutches.
I don't think that means the messages were delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26,750 during a filling of the ATM at the Newport on the Levee complex.
On Friday morning, a Newport police report said the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling up an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in an entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, the second man ran behind a Brink employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects fleeing the scene, the statement said, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
After announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known as Ye and used the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came ahead of his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to promote his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ti'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm me, that's us.
It was created from Kanye, which means the only, to Ye, which is a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West contributor, Jay-Z, also used versions with or without a hyphen and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that he would never use the military to conquer the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the army fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to provide support to young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those studying and opening up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education pushed young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double artificial intelligence funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on research in the field, said investor and artificial intelligence practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after different parts of the U.S. government issued artificial intelligence announcements, although the United States generally does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: its goal is to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the realm of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Supersiles of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, executive director of Synoviation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee acknowledged earlier U.S. government tech competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when he planned the next competition where future visionaries could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
It doesn't take away from us academic leaders, it's what corporations do," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have employed great individuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changing immigration policies could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence efforts.
I think we should automatically offer green cards to students in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued a plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences is subsidizing people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which seeks to involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of an artificial intelligence election committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment for the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that has sought to form a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonia's citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents the conquest of its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents say it could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Đorđe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether at least 50 percent of the vote would be needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was, "Are you in favor of membership in the NATO alliance and the EU with an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely within the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgieva, 79.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be required to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1am.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when a total of 66 per cent of voters took part in the election.
I came here to vote for my children, we have a place in Europe," said José Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on changing their name, which could pave the way for their membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and dragging chairs in front of tents that were torn apart by those who would boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised heads, not the back door," he said.
We're a poor, but proud country.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian community.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investments in Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
I believe that the vast majority will vote "yes" because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the ballots.
He said the result would be "a confirmation of our future."
A poll published on Monday at the Institute for Political Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - which is below the required turnout.
According to a second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be successful, a turnout of 50% plus one vote is required.
The referendum's failure would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling won the 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It was very easy when Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before he was in the open field.
The Aguera were then surrounded by three green shirts.
He pushed around a defensive player and was faster than a few more on the edge of Brighton.
He then added it to the left, finding Sterling.
The English striker used his first shot in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero had some problems with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at the time.
But Sterling was the one who gave the non-blues an initial advantage in the Premier League.
He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's side of the field.
He added Leroy Sane on his left side.
Sanne touched him a few times before sending Sterling to the goal.
A sky-rocketing attacker threw the ball into the net before slipping off the field.
City is battling Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game with no competitive significance against the Rockies.
Because the Nationals were eliminated in an elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another game.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take a stand on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockyes, who have a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, are still in the running.
Rockies at least have a direct pass due to a 5:2 win against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the league's first title.
Although we don't play for anything, we can at least go out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams is likely to be at the highest level in all these years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?
The Nationals still have to announce the initial team for Sunday, but they are reportedly willing to let Scherzinger throw in the situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw away on Sunday when he usually rests.
The right-hand man leads 18:7 this season with an average of 2.53, 300 stops in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation surrounding the election of his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican's midterm election.
Everything we've done will be at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important choices of our lives.
These are some of the big, big – even though I didn't actually run, I'm a candidate because I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these horrible, horrible groups of radical Democrats, that's what's happening right now.
And they are determined to restore power by using all possible means, see the evil, the dirty games.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going to run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a "resistance and interference" mission.
And you've seen it in the past four days," he said, calling Democrats angry, mean, evil and dishonest.
He cited a Democratic senator and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Diane Feinstein, as a name that prompted the audience to vehemently protest.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you released the document to the public?
Oh, yeah, what?
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the momentum activists at my local party voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I'm the latest in a series of Labour members who have been told they're not welcome, all because we've expressed our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was adamantly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, and ironically, these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement from a meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East on Friday read: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member, Friday night meetings were mostly like this.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not so, and the promise of a more "kinder, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is evaluated on the basis of whether it is acceptable to party leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues who I believed shared similar political views began to expect me to make a 180-degree turn and take positions that I would never agree with, whether it's national security or the European Union's single market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't matter what I say - it's accompanied by a torrent of insults on social media, calls for removal from the party, condemnations of the center's politics, and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
On the contrary, I know that I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments are mostly political to me.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who deal with a torrent of sexual or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not retreat.
One of the most disappointing things about this era is how these levels of insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer parties that accept different views and every vote of confidence or change of the rules of selection of parties is narrowed.
I've been given a lot of advice for the last two years, and I've been urged to run away, to be less vocal, and then I'll be okay.
That's why I didn't get into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the negligence of Prime Minister Thatcher's government over which my primary school was literally collapsing, I have sought to advocate for better public services for those who need it most, whether as a local councilor or minister in government.
I've never been in hiding my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would say that when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will endanger households, jobs and our public services, I don't understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not addressed to Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threats by removing me from the party or the political joke will not stop me from acting in the way I think is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr has won this exciting game of the day in the Tennent's Premier League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeaten of 10 teams.
In the end, the home team won thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of opportunities used, and the coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
We've been tested in games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, said: "Every honor to Ayru, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have."
Grant Naderson's attempt at the 14th minute turned Frazier Climo gave Ayra a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take a numerical advantage, and Jason Baggot captured an unconverted attempt.
Climo increased Ayra's lead with penalties before becoming a solo attempt at a score of 17:5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose's second half started well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which turned Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a prolonged interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was brought on the stretch, and in the following, Ayr increased the advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt, which turned Climo.
Ayrra's deputy captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card, and Melrose again used numerical supremacy with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts returned when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card due to a foul over the climate without a ball. MacPherson scored a touch down from the penalty line behind the upcoming Ayr prayer.
Climo turned, as he had done almost since the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up a blow from David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent Greg Henry's wing for a fifth attempt at the host.
The star of the Still Game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is preparing to move to the hospitality industry after learning he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series for which he writes the script and stars alongside his longtime partner in comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the series and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craigang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmor Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, although a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper said Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean.
The sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There are blue ocean flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are marked with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty.
Across the mainland, Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they lost in favor of Chile in a bloody battle over natural resources in the 19th century - as well as a desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, with Bolivia awaiting a verdict by the international court of justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has captured the momentum, in a spirit of unity and virtue, and of course it expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadil, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the international court of justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia and claim that after decades of grueling negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign sea exit.
Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also has a big stake in Monday's ruling.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The Netherlands-based United Nations body has no power to assign Chilean territory and said it would not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was made only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have turned him back.
The problem of access to the sea has been embraced by the current Bolivian authorities," she said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric killed the rest of Chile's goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold the talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a "exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreement on mutual pleasure," he said.
Calzadil has also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - is using the issue of sea exit as a political crutches.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past.
North Korea says disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his people would not end their nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the conflicting leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of restarting the deadlocked nuclear talks, more than three months after Singapore and meeting Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's just a dream that the continuation of sanctions and opposition from the United States will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not prepared to agree to the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang in its rejection of the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the sole guarantee of its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris Fashion Show showcases the latest line of huge hats you'll soon see on a nearby shopping street.
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you're in the right place.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of ragged hats on the runways of their spring and summer 2019 shows, overshadowing everything at Paris Fashion Week.
The extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers showed their impressive creations on the runways.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an overcrowded hat with a wide feathered rim that swallowed the head of the model.
Other bulky additions have found watermelons with decorative stones, a wizard's hat, and even pineapples, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had curly lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did in high fashion.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment with a breather and a mask, and the other resembled a cornet with a melted ice cream.
And if you're one of those who follow the trend of attracting attention, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
Huge hats came after "La Bombe," a two-footed straw hat seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social media, sent another big creation on the runway - a strawberry beach bag that is almost as big as the model that wore it.
The plastic bag of raffia with cuts and white leather lunch was a highlight of Jacquemus's La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Luke Armitage stylist told FEMAIL: "I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive in time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-dimensional fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is essential to the citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland are proud of outstanding academic achievement, and this has continued in 2018 with a new set of outstanding test scores, further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of services to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and more education, a career and a place in the society of the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject for school students.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it, it affects his head.
If you talk to him in his tongue, it's good for him.
This is a strong reminder that we can't rely only on English if we want to build good relationships and trust with people from other countries.
According to the results of the examinations this year, we see that the languages are at the top of the league tables, with the highest passing scores in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a grade A in the final exam of high school.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students received a grade A from the Mandarin language at the final exam in high school, while 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French and 63% of those who learn Spanish, also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electives, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (natural science, technology, mechanical engineering and mathematics) and in third-party programs, and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17 percent of the reasons employers had difficulty filling jobs were the lack of those who knew foreign languages.
Knowledge of foreign languages is becoming more and more necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs for which knowledge of foreign languages is needed, this skill is essential in the world of globalization.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they know another language, they will have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person speaking multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 Britons, 75 per cent were not able to speak a second language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, investing in foreign language learning is important for today's children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a few languages to choose from in an independent school, with a professional teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
At this time, there can be no denying that in a global business environment languages are crucial for the country's future, so it must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's good for the fair.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is set to make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
We still don't know how many minutes he'll play.
It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans in six games during the Lakers season.
At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While his vote to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is pending, Trump plans to increase his support in the midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia under the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss hearings this week over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, which has been tense over allegations of sexual harassment, and the expected Senate vote has been delayed by seven days until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans achieve better results in the November election.
President Trump's campaign said the rallies were being held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
Control of Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to present himself, told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Westbanco Arena in Wheeling, the event could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to a Virginia Metro News report.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time this month, where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who doesn't stand well in the polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president came to try to raise his ratings in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: A U.S. team has demonstrated a struggle to keep hope ahead of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoons may be exactly what this Ryder Cup was all about.
The momentum of the pendulum is a completely fictional concept in sports, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this.
Who do you think is having a stroke right now?
They led six points and now four, so it can be said that the momentum is on our side," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points out of a possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last shot and led by his example.
The shouts of celebration became more and more loud during his round, eventually playing a key blow to a draw in the fourth match, when he and Thomas fell behind two after two.
His final shot with 15 holes was greeted with a similar shout, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
You just have to do your best and take care of your match," said Spieth.
That's all those players have left.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but irresistible European couple has won all four matches and a game without mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't play the God of Strike on Saturday afternoon, and escaped them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game, which they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience, solidified them as their main favorites on Sunday, and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could win a potential European victory as the sun sets over the Le Golf National.
It's best to have both at the same time in different holes.
But it's still too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball game that morning, when he played in pairs with Alex Noren.
A single blow to God and two in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole from which they could not even spring.
No one can help you get out of your hole on Sunday.
The four-ball and four-ball game is so fascinating to watch closely for the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ways in which the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has a big advantage ahead of the final day, but this four-day session has shown that the U.S. team has a desire to fight that some doubted, especially in continental America.
Europe leads 10:6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's four-ball and four-match matches, it has achieved a 10:6 advantage over the United States.
Inspired by the couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he led first with two wins over the moody Tiger Woods, increasing the score so far on the Le Golf National's four-point field.
Thomas Bjorn's Europeans in a fight to win back the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine Golf Club two years ago, dominated the imprecise Americans in a four-ball game in the morning and won the series with 3:1.
The United States has provided more resistance to the four-match tournament, winning two matches but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Fury's team must win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari were named "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four matches.
After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they've mastered the exhausted Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday for a moment, has now lost 19 out of 29 games in a four-ball game and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during a four-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in a four-game tournament and suffered a 2:1 loss from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepk - the first and third in the world.
Not everything went according to the plan of this pleasant day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner of the main tournament Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point goal for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a 2-1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game, to return later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned after four points behind individual matches, although Fury's side, which defends the title, has had enough of a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it doesn't appear that they could carry out a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says there is "no talk of unilateral disarmament" if there is no trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens its mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances countries would not unilaterally give up their nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures to show goodwill" over the past year, such as cutting off nuclear and missile tests, dismantling its nuclear facilities, and vowing not to replicate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, there is no appropriate response from the United States," he said.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no talk of disarmament.
Although Ri repeated the famous complaints of North Korea's resistance to the "graduation" approach to denuclearization by which North Korea would be rewarded for its gradual steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also been silent on calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States does not give up on denuclearization first and increases the level of pressure on sanctions to force it to achieve its goal, even in opposition to the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is a desolate dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the extended sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If we were to negotiate this problem with South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such an exitless position."
However, the tone of Rio's speech differed sharply from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that the firing of U.S. land-based missiles by North Korea was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim a "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, which threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea carries out denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a timeline for this, saying, "If necessary, let it last two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Secret Security Council sanctions must continue to be implemented strictly and without easing until there is complete, final, confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio de Janeiro outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang with the words that progress had been made, and North Korea condemned him after only a few hours for making "gangster demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile field as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures."
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" required by Trump's security guarantees in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest.
This year's new course at Harvard University aims to force students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho learning culture â€"all night with the help of caffeine.
One academic noted that the students of the world's leading universities are often ignorant of the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created a course that he believes is the only one of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you only telling me this now, in my absolute year?"
She said no one ever told her how important the dream was - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year's course teaches students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports results, as well as improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was observed that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of the room in the student's home and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance and the importance of the routine before bed.
In the second part, participants were told that a long-term lack of sleep could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We are aware that this will not change the student's behavior.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride over the "worn night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and high quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even against excess weight, because due to lack of sleep, the brain is turning into a starving regime, which is why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler come up with a course after attending one of his lectures in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to stand up for it on a whole campus level.
It is hoped that the next step is to ask all graduate students to pass a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students think about setting the alarm in time to sleep and wake up and take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Meng's goal was defeated by Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another depressive loss in their guests when Dolly Meng was shot by a splinter team of Steven Gerrard in a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The team at Ibrox wanted to win their first victory in a four-to-one victory in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won Gerrard only the second loss in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of the Ladbrokes Premier League, Hearts.
Meng was struck seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired cast of Rangers never came close to equalizing.
While the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place, Livingston has climbed to third and behind the Hibernians only because of their goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the line judge, Calum Spence, had to show some help when he was shot from the side by an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr and placed in the semi-finals of the Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, Holt opted for the same 11 Livingston players who took a point at Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short of scoring a goal just two minutes after Meng's first addition to the empty space sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed a big chance and shot next to the goal.
Kegan Jacobs' deep free kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot next to the goal at the end of the line.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly, with no major problems, defended the blow to Lassana Coulibaly's head and tamed the shot that was sent by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true balance of power during the game, no one can deny that he was deserved, if anything, then because of his efforts.
The Rangers couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep free kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Meng as a simple finisher.
Gerard reacted to Ryan Kent's move instead of Coulibaly, and the replacement almost immediately gave the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line and blocked him.
However, Livingston continued to make the guests play just as they fit, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halket.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase their advantage in the final minutes, but McGregor held up well and defended the attack on Jacobs, and then Lithgow would send the ball from the head to the goal.
Rangers substitute player Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, asked for another penalty when he got in touch with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, the station from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, on this day 136 years ago... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the mainstays of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in 1950's "The Bell of the Coronade," starring seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms in your ears thanks to radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Yes, it's a crack!"
Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then re-injected.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune cells from the patient, converting them into a laboratory so they can see HER2 protein, and re-injecting them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American Institute of Malignant Diseases at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps the growth of several types of cancer" including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" the same way to target malignant cells was effective in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a tough speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance on the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time
Kanye West was whistled into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a brawl in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, that evening, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Make America Great," he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support for Trump.
So many times I've spoken to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I didn't care about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began a sketch show starring Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's show was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make a mockery of West by uploading a video.
West also complained to the crowd that he had a hard time behind the scenes because of his cap.
I've been teased behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
They've been teasing me!
And then they tell me I'm down," the Washington Examiner said.
West continued: "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that it will wear Superman's mantle because it means you can't order me.
Try your love.
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL show were visibly embarrassed, Variety reported, while one person who was present said: "The entire studio has completely shut down."
West was replaced by Ariana Grande, whose former partner, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West was confused by the performance of the song I love it disguised as a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you you for not retreating before the abusers."
But the show's host, Karen Hunt, tweeted that West was simply "what he really is and it's absolutely beautiful."
But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) for whom I believe he embraces and spreads an ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it would now be known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and, of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast
A 40-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore district, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harington has condemned the toxic macho culture.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, who has a sword in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO Game of Thrones series.
However, the 31-year-old turned to the cat hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys often think they need to be rough to be respected.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic macho culture in the #MeToo era.
The recently married partner of the Game of Thrones, Leslie Rose, 31, has admitted to having a "strong need" to address the issue.
I'm quite concerned about the question right now - what did we do wrong with the presentation of masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men when they grow up when it comes to the problem we see now?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of toxic macho culture because of the portrayal of male characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is a matter of upbringing?"
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes them feel like they have to fit into a certain pattern of behavior?
I think that's one of the main questions of our time - how can we change that?
Obviously something went wrong for the boys.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the prequels or sequels to the Game of Thrones series after its completion next summer, saying he had "finished with battlefields and horses."
Keith will star in a play by Sam Shepard True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that having met his wife Rose is the best thing that ever happened in the Game of Thrones series.
In this series, I met my wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love partner of Kit's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Lesla's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, a change from the previous state.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people receiving HIV has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Studies estimate that because of conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually get married to women.
The transmission of the virus often occurs due to inappropriate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied reports that any of her staff has published information about Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters has denied reports that one of her staff published personal information from three U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
A Los Angeles-based Democratic lawmaker says the claims are being made by experts and "ultra-right wing" websites.
Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcha, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was reported by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of its staff, Hill said.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie," Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are threatened by these false and false claims - is in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and absolute lie.
Waters's statement soon sparked condemnation online, which was also made by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
This denial exudes anger," wrote Fleischer.
This leads to the conclusion that she doesn't have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be rude.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
They have to be calm and calm.
Fleischer has apparently compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to oust Waters in midterm elections, also tweeted.
It's a big deal if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate authorities and judicial authorities about these false claims."
We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that before the law they are held accountable for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Johnny English is back in action - a young spy parody with Rowan Atkinson.
It has already turned into a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British film, which can also be applied to this continuation of the franchise of satirical action-comedies about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to the screen in 2011 with the continuation of Johnny English: Born Again.
Is it ironic to say that we are clearly useless to be a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, a lush, incompetent Johnny English rubber-face has got a new opportunity to spray something - with his name giving more than anything that it's a general comic creation designed for a cinema audience that's not the native language.
This is, of course, a silly secret agent who, despite bizarre claims to be the highest glamour, carries a little bit of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean's tumult, and a crumb of that guy who played only one note as part of the theme tune of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It was also originally based on a traveler and an international man covered by a veil of secrecy that Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two of the most recent scenes are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval knightly armor and the rotor blades briefly buzzed about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is felt weak and very strangely redundant, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible are confidently adding comedic elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's unannounced adventures are not as inventive and elaborate as Atkinson's silent-film-style geeks in Mr Bean's image.
Now it's a very important issue that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated a British super secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty - unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a full glass of water for a prime minister, a pompous and gruesome character who's already suffered a total meltdown due to the fall of political popularity: Emma Thomson's masterfully played this character, modeled on Theresa May, but the script is rather sparse.
Her intelligence advisers have been informed that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retirees.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a fancy institution, but unofficially holds lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gigs when English is holding a spy academy in the style of "School of Rock."
England quickly returns to Whitehall for emergency instruction and to reunite with their former patient partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine has been spent.
So Batman and Robin are once again at the service of Her Majesty's Secret Service and the happiness of the beautiful fatal wife Ophelia Bulletov, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into a trap with a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of comedy events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, wreaking havoc with their hide-and-seek on Volta's luxury yacht, and English launches a real anarchy trying to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house using virtual reality headsets.
It's obvious that a lot of effort has been made in that last sequence, but no matter how pleasant and cheerful, the whole film is made for children.
Quite a mediocre quality.
As with other Johnny English films, I can't help but wonder if the British film industry can come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent.
The Labour Party denies the plan for the British to work four days a week and will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but they will be paid five days a week.
The party reportedly wants the heads of companies to transfer time that they can save thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits into a party approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as a party industrial strategy in general.
The Labour Party would not be the first party to approve the idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition does not have the support of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of the Labour Party last week to expose his view of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "non-personal directors" and "profiters" in utility companies.
The plans of the opposition's chancellor also mean that the current owners of water supply companies may not return their entire investments because Labour could impose "debts" on perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on the boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds that would assign 10% of the value of private sector companies to employees who are likely to reap annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raised questions about whether the Bureau's investigation could prompt some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Rep. Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
I think, of course," Kennedy said.
Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the allegations had surfaced, and I asked, "Did you do that?"
He was steadfast, determined, unambiguous.
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be inconvenient.
My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a strong accusation would be needed," he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the festival of the citizens of the world and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual musical event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal - to end poverty in the world.
Now at the age of seven, the Festival of Citizens of the World will bring together tens of thousands of people on the big lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which will end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Citizens of the World, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket for an event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a number of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a phone call, and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal - ending poverty.
But how successful is the project of a citizen of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another form of so-called clickivism - when people believe they've done something that will change the world by signing a petition online or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Citizen of the World Initiative has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million shares of its supporters advocating for a range of different goals.
These actions have led world leaders to announce promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 promises and announcements arising from their shares, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or raised.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly affected 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, the partnership between investors and realizers from the UK who have pledged to help children grow into their full potential, promising that Rwanda will allocate $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the world's citizens.
With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a historical footnote," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, who visited a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it would fund a project called "The Power of Nutrition," which will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world says, "It will be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we will fall and fall."
However, as all major civil rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia's energy exports to the Navy - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can use its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - namely, is there at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe that the reason they want to sell energy in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the center of southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
The United States has the opportunity, together with our Navy, to ensure that the sea corridors remain open or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event hosted by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying it was the same thing.
The economic option for Iran and Russia consists more or less in the use and replacement of fuel," he said, adding that Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after the Trump administration's mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, which would replace Russia, which is a far more favorable option for European consumers.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is worth $11 billion, should double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means to exert pressure and that consumers should have the option of selecting suppliers," Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has sparked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the German Industry Alliance (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Alliance (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the 2020 presidential nomination, Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the next midterm elections.
During a meeting at a city hall in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said.
After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting at the city hall, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction."
I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was named for her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the results of a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the electorate that voted for Warren did not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't be prosecuted, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University's Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent backed the candidacy.
The poll found there was more support for former Gov. Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against the nomination.
Other Democratic names discussed in terms of their potential candidacy in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the PTSD of Track Palin at a rally in support of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after Monday night's incident.
What my son goes through, what he goes through after he comes back, can connect with what happens to other families who suffer the consequences of PTSD and the vulnerabilities with which our soldiers come back," she told a rally of support for President Donald Trump in the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "burning topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added, "They're coming back a little different, they're coming back stronger, wondering if there's any respect for what their comrades and pilots have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - an attack on a woman, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of opiates, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C., support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a review of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District submitted a friendly report to the Washington Court on Friday to support asylum seekers who challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal police in August has not been revealed.
She said she was abused by her partner "and by the violent members of his gang," but U.S. officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come in the U.S., are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy annulled a 2014 immigration appeals committee that allowed immigrants who do not own documents and fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General, General Carl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "has neglected decades of state, federal and international law."
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and thus that the chamber violates that principle," the report said.
Lawyers further claimed in the report that the police, which make it impossible for immigrants to enter the U.S. economy, are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or for their political opinions," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palu as the death toll doubles in search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
It's very tense," said Rees Kusum, a 35-year-old mother, as she strolled her sick little boy at a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute, an ambulance is brought to the body.
The lack of clean water."
Residents are returning to their homes, overflowing with flooded things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, such as Dwy Harris, whose back and shoulder were broken, are located outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients are being provided outside with help due to continued strong back-and-forth tremors.
His eyes were full of tears as he felt a powerful earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I think I've been pressured by the ruins of the wall," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
I heard my wife crying calling for help and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of committing "violence with propaganda ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid addition to the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marks what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it's common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where each other's tariffs on imports are increasing.
As an example, earlier Chinese tariffs in the trade war were aimed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former Iowa state mayor who is a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a commentary published in the weekly Des Moines Register, "now doubles that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting America's precious tradition of free speech and press freedom, placing a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," he wrote.
By contrast, on a kiosk down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any genuine reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on China's troubled economic path, bearing in mind that the Chinese media are under the firm stick of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not state what the newspaper was about.
Republicans are deterring women from voting ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts say.
Analysts have warned that a large number of top Republicans defending and standing alongside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of sexual assault, will experience negative reactions, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense, and most Republicans are already showing that they want to give their vote.
There's no going back in these matters," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that what Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) asked the FBI to investigate would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, either in November," said Karina Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and state spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, while Republicans who control the House Judiciary Committee decided to persevere with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
People say it's already high, which is true.
But he could be taller, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters aged between 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court judge, analysts believed there could be negative reactions if Republicans persisted in the appointment.
This has become a big mess for the Great Old Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
It's not just a vote of the Committee or a final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also a matter of how Republicans dealt with this issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, said in a statement.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight tilt on Kavanaugh's side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents are definitely or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably lying during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who made the accusation, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court judge's nominee showed her his genitals while attending a party during their Yale studies in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid, created by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention of Inrupt was "world domination."
We have to do it right now," he said, referring to the startup.
This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or a personal online store.
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique to a personal data store on the network is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's chief executive, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to provide sources, processes, and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM's security platform, a number of development engineers engaged in the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
As of this week, technology engineers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a full change where all of their business models would be completely destroyed overnight.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid.
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Although powered by Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Open Data Institute Foundation.
I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: A celebration of Victoria's Cross awarded to a priest in World War I
A celebration honoring the only priest of the Anglican Church who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a World War I fighter was held in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack at Bellingise and Lehaucourt.
However, a few days later he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won Britain's highest military honor.
At a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial plaque.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy gunfire from the battlefield and machine gun fire."
He later rushed to the firing line and led the lead forward with the "greatest heroism" before rushing to the Polish gun without any help and tripping three from the military squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never reach, but also something that causes submission."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead got Pepe Pig.
Imagine that, you've stayed up all night to watch a series of Beltar 206 matches, to prevent you from watching the main event.
The San Jose program featured 13 fights, including six on the main list, and aired live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At six o'clock in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK remained stunned when the broadcast was interrupted by Pepe Pig.
Many were not impressed by the fact that they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning due to fighting.
A fan on Twitter described the disruption as "some kind of sick joke."
It's a rule of the government that at 6 a.m. this content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a program for children," Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said in a statement.
The "Peep Pig," yes.
Bellator chairman Scott Cocker said he would work on his schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
I think when I talk about rewriting, I think we can probably solve that," Cocker said.
But the transmission is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to do anything until we have Sunday, when they'll be here on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the interruption occurred, the correspondence was circulating and they were all hostile.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we're overdoing it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexuality.
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which represented Lauren Laverne, he said he was openly talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months due to illness.
Appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
To this day, those feelings of less value and a feeling of being different were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed.
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so people aren't disappointed when they find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a very important fighter for the LGBT community and has used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he was happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "surprised him."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, and said the age difference was never a problem.
When you live so much while you're so young," he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "It's hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple took on the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's parents in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" had changed.
If you asked me last year, it was just that I had to win a gold medal," he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold is Robbie.
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if he still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him "You won't be here to sit in the front row, Dad," he said.
I held his hand until he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing, and when he was dead, I finally realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I just knew that's what I've been dreaming about all my life - swimming in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as the inspiration for his selection of his first song, Proud of Heather Small, which was resounding in him as he prepared for the Olympics and from which he is still trailing.

Mickelson out of shape at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to regain form so that this will not be an unshakable milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often been the case for the United States, the five-time major winner spent the day cheering and improving the range of the game, hoping to correct what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the height of his career, is not the ideal choice for the demanding Le Golf National court, where a long rough terrain regularly punishes stray shots.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson faces British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, get to a hot start, the Mickelson game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man, but couldn't say anything more.
He fully understood the role he played today, he patted me on my shoulder, and he said he'd be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
He believes in himself very much.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I'm sure I didn't want to play two games.
I thought there were more, but that was the way it was, and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will surpass Nick Fald's record for Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup, where he has never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence had brought some intangible value to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have a guy like that on the team," he said.
I think it was fun for the younger players to give him a chance, and this week it was fun to watch.
He gives much more than just a game.
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last days of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Days first appeared at a game held in the town of Valderrama in 1997, when the side whose captain was Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they finished the competition with a narrow difference of 141⁄2-131⁄2⁄2⁄2.
You're constantly reminded that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won," Bjorn said after watching the 2018 team win the 5-3 result on Friday and led 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the history and everyone in the team will show me that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you go to the end.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that remains the focus.
I'm focused on 12 players on our side all the time, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side of the road - the biggest players in the world.
He added: "I would never allow this to happen.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow is a game, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with your partner when things go well, but when you're there, you're testing yourself as a golf player.
That's the message you have to pass on to the players - give it your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he's got to do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his teammate Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they did in the pair, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of those big turns on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser after Europe performed the "miracle in Medina."
I remember every damn word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, encouraged his players before the last day.
Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very start of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he starts with such a win, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We've formed our line-up accordingly and we've prepared the guys to try to do some magic tomorrow, you know.
Thomas is assigned to try to counter the attack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
I went with this group of guys in this lineup because I think she can cover it all the way to the end," Bjorn said.
The new German warship is on hold again.
The new frigate of the German Navy was due to be launched in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but will not arrive in at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship in the class of all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which were commissioned in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as it is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisible technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for the latest frigates to be deployed for up to two years without returning to their home port.
However, permanent delays mean that the most advanced warships, which were meant to allow Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will already be obsolete at the time they are being used.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made its way into the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and brought it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would make the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were of particular importance because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who operated the old Bremen-class frigates.
The ship has also been shown to be significantly too heavy to reduce its impact and limit the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of heavy ship Rheinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as those used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), up from the initial $2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy was "in fact running out of ships that could be deployed."
The official said the problem has grown over time, as old ships have been cancelled and replacement ships have not been procured.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's frigates could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the bat's secret life.
A new study conducted on a property in the hills of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide to future conservation activities.
A study led by scientists from the Scottish National Fund will follow ordinary bats and a species of soprano Pipistrella, and a brown long bat and bat species of Daubenton in the Inverwe Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be installed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the recordings of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what species they do.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the level of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant at NTS, hopes the results will show which habitats are the most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This data will help determine the benefits of working on habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which negatively affects the litter and habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of building materials, and home cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when they catch prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten qualified experts who regularly conduct checks, inspections of the litter, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Treave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The estate manager, David Thompson, said the property was ideal for them.
We have a big bat area here in Threave," he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
But there is so much more unknown about bats, so what we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to advance.
He points out how important it is to check whether the bats are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of a mother's litter will kill up to 400 women and young people, which will likely lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and are prohibited by law from killing, harassing, harassing or destroying their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish bat conservation fund, encouraged the public to get involved and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species evolves."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of raping him as "fake news," saying people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
She was reportedly paid $375,000 to avoid the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Addressing his followers, who are 142 million on Instagram Live, hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the reports, calling them "fake news."
No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in a camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain fame talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "intangible damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled in the wake of the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99% good guy" who failed those "1%."
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had a sexual relationship, but that he was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fear of retribution" and worried she would be "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says he is now seeking annulment of the settlement because it is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: The UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will regret "forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Secretary of State Greg Clark said.
He added that what Toyota UK has told the BBC is "concerning" if Britain leaves the EU without a deal to temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
Toyota Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a halt to production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if Britain leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Oxford mini-factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what automakers call the risks of a supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the "just in time" principle, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be a cutoff at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store supplies for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said the "Chequers" plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border."
We need to have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will allow me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to grab this opportunity," he said in a statement.
An example not only of Toyota, but of other manufacturers is that we have to be absolutely capable of continuing what has been an extremely successful array of supply chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it warned that long-term costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the union union union union in the factory, said his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when jobs like this close, they never return again.
A government spokesman said: "We must present a precise and convincing plan of our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as the battle for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the election, ties between Trump's aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, has been a topic of talk in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also discussed sounding to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the president's dismissal based on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the rumors.
But he was in the White House last Monday amid rumors that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would not like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into Kavanaugh for a week, further delaying the Senate vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for this has not yet been determined, it could be this week, and it could be postponed for another week given all the other things that are happening about the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press to always be informed."
Some journalists would refute this claim: Sanders has not given a brief address to reporters at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that a small number of short speeches were not a result of "theatrical behavior" of a TV journalist, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
She said she would increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without giving evidence, "We've seen those numbers.
The short talk will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the president the question of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it as much as we can and you've seen us do it over the past couple of weeks, and those talks with the president of the United States will replace a short talk to the press.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in an open session or press conference during a visit to the White House.
Self-contained press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of a crowd of journalists unbridled and occasionally strange.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland about the concerns surrounding Brexit.
The Secretary of Health has written to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their country's gratitude and desire to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to settle the costs of the EU citizens working in its decentralized public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this has been a very busy time for you all.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury.
State Tigers Tennessee defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's 31:27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennesseen Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
He got to the field line and just crashed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting it on and taking it for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/volume of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red shirt, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five total shootings on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing him to a total of 18 shootings in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes for buying real estate in the UK.
Customers from foreign countries will be charged higher taxes when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the conservatives.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
Higher taxes will be charged to those who don't pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes on real estate purchases in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May said on Monday.
This step will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by seeking to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
Higher taxes will be levied on individuals and businesses that don't pay taxes in the UK, with additional money strengthening the government's intention to fight outdoor sleep.
An additional fee, which, in addition to existing fees, including several levels, was introduced two years ago to another property and purchase for rent, could be as much as 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to increase revenue by up to £120 million a year.
It's estimated that 13% of London's newly built properties are bought by people who don't live in the UK, which is why prices are rising, and buyers who buy real estate for the first time are harder to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities due to the large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in taxes to help more young people reach their first home.
He accused construction firms of keeping high real estate prices first when they were not using land, and asked Mrs May to give up quotas for affordable homes as soon as possible to end Britain's "disgrace on housing policies."
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the suspension of any evictions.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
Last year I said I would dedicate my term as prime minister to restoring the British dream that every new generation needs to be better.
And that's how we repair our poor housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it can't be right for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the UK's valuable ones.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too far for many people, and the inhumane sleep in the open is still very real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland."
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "extreme ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish national team at some point.
Forty-two-year-old Scotland is enjoying the challenge of bringing the club back to life from the northeast, currently in third place in the Premier League, with three points less than the top spot.
He moved to the stadium this summer after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was on the B-Team and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound show.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I were successful in running the club.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic club boss said he did not feel any discomfort because he was coming after such big names in such a big club, after refusing to offer offers to Barnsley and Ipswich Town clubs.
The measure of my success at this point will be "will I be able to get this club back into the Premier League?"
Judging by the structure and capabilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I can only be considered successful if I can get the club back to where it belongs.
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period he spent as an assistant to the head of the club, and 15 months as part of Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Allo recover from falling to the third category, and St. Mirren led from the brink of falling into the lower league to the winner of the championship next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled the takeover of Allo's club.
I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I earned a decent amount of money, and I enjoyed some solid success.
Playing can be difficult.
There's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just works for me.
I've always wanted to do management and now I'm doing it, in my adult life I've never felt more comfortable than I do now.

The perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 17:30, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has increased the circulation of British pubs struggling to survive, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In a group of pubs and bars, sales rose 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic fell by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm, who collected the data, said: "The lasting sunshine time and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup contributed to July following a similar pattern as the previous month's June, when pubs saw an increase of 2.8%, and restaurants had an even greater decline.
The drop in restaurant traffic of 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinking have achieved by far the best result with higher growth compared to comparable results from the previous period, compared to a drop in the number of restaurants traffic.
Food-focused pubs have also been killed by the sun, but not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
People just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% in a month, with food sales dropping by 3%.
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Fun Content and Hospitality of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have been witnessing since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to selling outside the home market.
It's no surprise that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a 4.8% drop in annual sales will be particularly painful with pre-existing price pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused caterers, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide a little too much relief.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting a slower rollout of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales tracking service in the UK's bars, pubs and restaurants, collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is an accepted industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that hides from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media account that hides from their parents and teachers.
A survey of more than 20,000 elementary school students found an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages.
The news has raised fears of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" order to show their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are 11 years old, make social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 elementary school students found a sharp increase in fake Instagram accounts, which refers to a photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" account showing their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter has revealed to a teenage girl who calls others "rape me."
A survey conducted by the UK Digital Consciousness and Independent Schools Conference (HMC) found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half admitted having private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create a space on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find it."
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee.

Doyle is Scotland's most award-winning athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from its rich experience internationally over the past decade.
Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the board," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of the athlete and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic golds, including winning 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and is now a regular expert on the BBC, has remained stationary after suffering a transitory ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time can tell if I'm going to recover and how long.
It's been a hard job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and now I'm doing agility exercises.
Thank you for encouraging messages.
An advertisement for a traitor in which mothers compare themselves to cows shared opinions on the Internet.
The company that produces the traitors shared opinions on the Internet with an advertisement that compares breastfeeding to the cows of the muse.
To mark the launch of a product that has been described as "the first silent traitor," consumer technology firm Elvie has released an ad inspired by an entertaining music video that shows the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between a hay and a cow with a song that says, "Yes, I'm mugging, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but that's not the time, it's my breasts."
It's like, "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, muse myself."
However, an advertisement posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions from viewers, while many said it sheds light on the "horrifying" dairy industry.
The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth just like us to produce milk, but their babies are abducted a few days after they are born."
Elvie's pump stops quietly in the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "It's obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why shouldn't they be used to advertise traitors to mothers who can keep their babies?
Someone else added: "Advertisement doesn't make sense."
Others stood in defense of the advertisement, and one woman admitted that her song was "surnery."
I think the idea is genius.
I would buy this if I were still pregnant.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit silly, but I figured it out right.
It's a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "This is a ridiculous advertisement aimed at mothers who issue milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "cows."
This is not an advertisement that praises or goes to the milk industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they all danced with discrete pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who produce milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or pipes and fits in the breastplate, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they're delivering milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing the parallels between nursing mothers and muse cows, we wanted to put the focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Marta Yakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children secretly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to find guardians for children.
Traditionally, most guardians were migrants without documents who were afraid to compromise their ability to stay in the country by stepping in to accept a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albance, a senior immigration and customs official, told Congress last week that the service had arrested dozens of people who applied for custody of unaccompanied minors.
The police later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
Nearly 80% of the people who are guardians or household members of guardians are illegal in this country, and most of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
We will continue to search for these people, Mr. Albance said.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to workers at the shelter.
Many will report by video calling instead of personally, in order to ask the immigration judge for the legalization of his status.
Those who are found not to meet the requirements will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain closed, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to an outburst of rage or attempted escape, according to shelter workers and reports that have arrived from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks have been raised in larger institutions such as the one in the city of Tornillo, where it's much easier to overlook signs that the child has problems.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria calls for an immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish "Occupying Forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country has been ongoing for eight years.
Mouallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign powers were illegal in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will deal with them appropriately."
They have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Mouallem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria was almost over, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its "holy struggle" until we exterminated all Syrian terrorists, including terrorist groups and "any foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly in charge of training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mouallem said there were good conditions for their return and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow these returns," he said.
They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in a province of three million people.
Mouallem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be launched against jihadists and fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of authorities and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare a path to an election.
Mouallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to "considering the members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why would Trump be elected for a second term?
Under that logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, what many liberals are likely to hope for, the impeachment and scandal would not end his term sooner.
This would undoubtedly be the "most dramatic end to the presidency of all time."
So far, there is no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers on a hit date, compared to four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and the Rachel Maddow Show MSNBC's cable channel rating exceeded 3.5 million viewers during the night with the news.
It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, the producer of "Selected Survivors" on ABC, said in a statement about the secretary of government who becomes president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scowell, a long-time comedy writer and author of "Just Funny Parts: And A Few Cruel Truths About Being Involved in a Hollywood Boys Club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
He said, "Because I'm laughing," said Mrs. Scovel.
Chaos has a lot of fun.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the Roe anti-Wade abortion law, whether immigrant families will be able to merge, and what the state of the global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you watched a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep background" for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket, and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trump's giving Stormy Daniels.
I'll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night," Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and creator of the show, said, commenting on the spin of the acting lineup and the daily plot of Trump's show (criticism of the American football league, praise for Kim Jong-un).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of about 80°C (27°C), but he shut himself in and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not until Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

The big inflow of money from the side in the most uncertain midterm election run for the House of Representatives
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a cash flood, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts, resulting in two candidates running for the same spot.
A recent redrawing of the county limits in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who came to the head of the second district after an early election last spring.
Lamb is fighting a second current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is a big overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally formed in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has launched a campaign finance campaign between major party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a wide-ranging special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The position has been held by the Republican Party for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts have given little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then resigns.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little incentive from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners threw out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered for El Salvador, which was estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would severely hit the Central American country with high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was meant to be a continuation of a similar last year's event that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, and thus ended any review of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new heavy messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton declined to comment on details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
The story
The following could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's obstruction of justice, which now has significant evidence in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation into the possible connection between Trump's campaign and Russia's attack on the election.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to re-enter the polls and possibly before a jury.
There are a lot of these "yes" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall, or those in Europe who are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, only that the West would oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such breaking points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The United States is now facing more of these breaking points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unrelenting position since the newspaper reported last year that it had proposed a covert recording of the president and made speculation that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times' statement was false.
How do we react if the FBI's recently ordered investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for the Congress that Mr. Trump will hold accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's dream.
But I don't think we're going to fall because of the lesson I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: A turbulent European century in five lives and one legendary house."
Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic before facing Rapido from Vienna.
The Rangers hosted Rapido from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, would put them in a good position to qualify for the G-League.
The knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until a tie with Villareal's final result 2-2, but he is confident that the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for further action.
It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game believing we could do something and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have taken them, but in all, the result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second and we were better.
We're having a big European night again on Thursday.
We hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough match because they had a good result in the last game, although with the support of the audience we can certainly win and achieve a positive result.
The past year has undoubtedly been tough, from what happened to my injuries to the changes in the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have.
The team is in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we're training well.
I hope we can continue, leave the last season behind, and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of retirement.
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how they would like to be cared for, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationalwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to give you care if you don't express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your advisor and your family and consider where and how to be provided to you, as such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that would help you cover those costs or self-insurance with your own savings - provided you have enough money.
Take care of your legal documents: at the root, prevent legal battles.
Make a decision on medical assistance to have an authorized trustee to monitor the medical care provided to you and ensure that health care workers act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider the signing of a full-time financial agreement.
This means that you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your aging parents find themselves in a situation where they need urgent medical attention and drive them to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about allergies and medications?
Get the details in writing to be ready.
It's not just about finances, it's about who the doctors are," Martin said.
What are the drugs?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Plan it.
A man shot with multiple shots from an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle while walking home from an evening out.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. in British summer time, as a "random act."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called on witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As there was a disconnect, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from Donggala province, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-degree quake's epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a district that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline on the northwest island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture form the basis of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami hit western Donggal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that slammed into the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude quake hit the city of Paang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude quake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed in the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska's State Police Agency.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit and given a $500 conditional bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday when he pleaded "certainly not guilty," the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he faces a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offenses, which are punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending in Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD following his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake that triggered the tsunami has destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a cut in connections and electricity supply, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The epicenter of the earthquake was directly adjacent to the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami slammed the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that has killed eight people - a rare sentence that has not been used in federal crimes in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented home depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, bringing down pedestrians and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a request for the death penalty, filed in the southern district of New York.
According to both cases, the death penalty can be imposed, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder and racketeering, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "deplorable, cruel and corrupt."
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucchi, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnucca, according to a request for sentencing.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since New York's southern district last had a death sentence threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching the video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked to point out the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal attorneys, said they were visibly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of acquittal, will only prolong the trauma of those events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
The Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the dissatisfaction" of the eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's lawmakers suggested he should be in charge of negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative Rep. Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "come out" if Mr. Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge to try to unite her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by conservatives who advocate staying in the EU and have joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from the Chequers despite attacks by supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said at a rally to go to Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be given the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
If he was the boss, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added: "I'm going to fight for Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our laws in our country.
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British changed their minds and wanted to remain completely false."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who actually took to the streets and chose us.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and listen to it.
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr. Farage told the crowd that politicians must be made to "feel displeasure" if they are to fail to make a decision in the 2016 referendum.
It's about trust between us - the people and our political elite," he said.
They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that's not going to happen."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel displeasure.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners against Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour leader Lord Adonis mocked conservatives over the security issues they had with the party's app at the opening of the conference.
These are people who tell us they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus plan, for an unhindered border state, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a complete farce.
A good Brexit is not possible," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a participatory meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran again in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She is at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the Electors, where she has used a participatory meeting format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren has turned the tide on how women go to Washington to fix our corrupt government, and that includes a woman in charge.
He was arrested after LSU's Sims was shot.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in a shooting that killed basketball player LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police station Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. at a press conference.
A video of the shooting was released on Friday, asking for help in finding the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to 247 Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, in possession of a weapon, and to shooting Waydea Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to a police station in East Baton Rouge County.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games last season with 10 starts and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 goals and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after his order secures him a victory over Sebastian Vettel.
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the team's order will play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the start and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two rounds and called on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and left Hamilton behind to get involved in the traffic at the back, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the wheel action, making the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior at risk of falling behind after a double move to defend the third round.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race by relying on his tyres to reach the high-speed finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally arrived in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done a really remarkable job of achieving one or two formal completions," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinsten at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are cruel, spiteful, and lying.
The only thing that could have happened, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil, and they are false, he said.
When you look at the posts and information that leaked to the public, and then they say, 'I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release the information to the public?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it out in public.
Wait a minute.
We let go... No, we didn't,' he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which leaked in early September, but Feinsten denied that the information leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't release her story to the public," Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep it secret and kept it secret, as she asked.
But her denial was not met with the approval of the president, who at a rally on Saturday night commented: "Let me tell you, it was really a bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president insisted that Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the evil, the wicked, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control."
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have made amends to defeat Belfast Giants in the Elte League on Friday with a win of 5 against 3 in a return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants initially scored two goals against Patrick Dwayer and Francis Beauvilleer.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the same before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
François Bouchard evened for Dundee before Lukas Lunwald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
It was the third loss in the Elta League season for Adam Keef, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two sides, and the Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwayer opened the match in the fourth minute, 3:35, with the help of Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford assisted Beauvilleer and doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a crowd at first, Sullivan returned the home team to the game in 13:10 minutes before Marquardt assisted Cowanie in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured Giants' lead with a second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to equalize in the measurement of the force with a goal at 27:37 minutes.
Cowanie and Charles combined to help Nielsen lead for the first time at the end of the second period, and he scored his fifth goal in the middle of the final period to secure his team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their five matches so far, welcome Milton Keynes in the next match on Friday.
An air traffic controller has lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board avoid an earthquake.
Indonesia's air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he died securing the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area, with many trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues escaping trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Palu Airport.
He stayed to ensure the safe take-off of the Batika Air Flight 6321, which at the time stood on the runway.
When he realized that the control tower was collapsing, he jumped from it.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
Our heart is breaking for this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster relief agency said access to Donggal, Sigi and Boutong cities was limited.
The death toll is believed to continue to rise as a number of bodies remain under rubble, and many are unable to reach," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
The waves, which reached a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News that emergency vehicles are bringing their bodies every minute.
The lack of clean water.
Small shops are looting everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there."
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work all day to carry out all the tasks related to evacuation."
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
The plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini says that after the plane crash in the lagoon, one person is missing.
The airline, whose plane crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said one person was missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it had been unable to trace the passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water in an attempt to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and what was the exact sequence of the event.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some people think the plane flew over the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was low.
That's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to make their way to a water hazard exit that sank to the waist of the plane.
He said the crew was panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked near the dock repairs also helped rescue the inflatable boat carrying passengers to the coast before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in PNG aircraft accidents in the past two decades, but none of them have been involved in Air Niugini.
An analyst reconstructs the sequence of events in the night in which a woman is burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office completed the case in a repeat case against a man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury that he used mobile phone data to compile a picture of the whereabouts of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the victims of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to investigate Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records show that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted her messages, calls, and contact information for some time after his death.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should start with the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to follow later in the day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop?
Hip-hop seeks to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling its composition with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when it dealt with political messages and social issues.
They want to return to their roots and return to the popularity of hip-hop.
Artists such as the Fugees and Common are gaining popularity in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's another black person!?
A New York nanny sues the couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discrimination basis after mistakenly receiving a text message from her mother complaining that she is another black person.
The couple denies that they are racists, judging the lawsuit as a gruesome one.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she came to work on her first day in 2016 when she realized that she was a new foster child, Giselle Maurice, a black woman.
One more black woman," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
When she became aware of her gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, was doing her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino woman instead.
Mrs. Maurice received a one-day salary and was sent home.
Maurice is suing the couple for $350 a day for six months, to whom she was originally hired to live with her family, though without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding that it was discrimination.
The couple responded to accusations of racism that the cancellation of Mauritania's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they insulted her they would not be able to believe her.
My wife sent me something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told the Post.
Would you trust your children with someone you've offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.
Qualifying the lawsuit as a scuffle, Plasco said his wife had only been given a two-month maternity leave and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to kill someone like that?
That's not very nice," added the investment banker.
While court proceedings are still ongoing, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and thinking.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not identify with the bear he was talking to, a new letter revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It's interesting to know what we know about Paddington's success.
She said that her father, who, before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write a children's book, would still be positive for the BBC if his work were rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with both happiness and sadness after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family.
He was such a man, he didn't like to be praised," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it was not really your merit.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the product of his imagination, he always attributed all his credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter died and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors were fighting to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say it was bad, and they didn't expect it to survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called me to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs she was given to keep her heart pumped slowly stopped working and did not flow through her bloodstream.
She died just a few minutes before that, and it was all gone.
I could only sit and wait, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by people and families.
I had to be gathered.
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for her daughter's death, boarded a plane along with other passengers who had never dreamed of her passing.
No one knew," she said.
I shook my head, and my tears flowed down my face.
It's hard to explain, but in the summer, I was overwhelmed by hope.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The mourners leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes set up cards on the Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression to commit suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious laugh.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room.
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase.
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after committing suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that this will leave consequences."
Mrs. Davis created these cards to make people know that there is someone you can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk.
Ms. Humpreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He didn't say he was depressed, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom - when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything else.
She says that his death was a huge trauma for them, but that they must overcome it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we're going to keep going and fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain.
I thought if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for - an investigation of a limited duration and scope - maybe that would unite us somewhat," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the board would fall apart because of irreconcilable party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their unhappiness is caused by the choice of moment.
Elections to Congress are held in just five weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans go through badly, their attempts to elect their man to the highest court are expected to be severely weakened.
On Saturday, George W. Bush phoned senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently houses 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could win at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is falling under Kim.
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers have said.
According to South Korea's Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug reported 1127 defectors last year, compared to 276 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the two key factors were stronger control of the border between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 3000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with South Korea, and it's easier to cross it than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal, not refugees, and often takes them back.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved noticeably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss stalled denuclearization talks.
This follows a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where it reached a broader agreement to work on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for a lack of progress so far.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not considered that we are the first to unilaterally disarm," he said in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical, saying he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hysterical and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that a woman would ever behave like that," Pelosi told Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost shouting and hugging when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, assessing the allegations against him with a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality, organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed his bias to the detriment of Democrats.
I think he's disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he's going against Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
When asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi would step down.
I'll say the following - if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but in no court in which he's now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's convictions against the Accessible Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
It's not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we're expected to say whether it's more wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
Justified anger, anger that has accumulated for months and years, and it cannot be solved without crying.
We cry when we're angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?
She continued: "I had a lot of help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere, and who said she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, the person she would talk to might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then he'd just keep going.
I thought it was great.
Tears are a way to get rid of anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of the previous job, in the office where most of the men were, is how, once I cried out for the indescribable anger, an older woman - a cold boss I've always been a little scared - grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
I never let them see me cry," she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy because they think they've hit you.
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Money Business and pulled out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that she had no reason not to consider running for president herself.
It wasn't a very well thought out decision," she told me 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already moving forward, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she vowed not to enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave men $1000 would give her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - thanks to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and anger over chauvinism - from which she got stuck in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, as the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what I was going to put on the monument.
She was crying.
How can a trade war between the United States and China be good for Beijing?
The first canonades of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is yet to be seen, the rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest hit this week came with new tariffs that hit $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items that practically tax half of all goods coming from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated with the same measure, with the latest tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to stop soon.
To force Washington to withdraw means complying with the demands, but public worship of the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes its next move well, U.S. pressure in the trade war can support China in the long run by reducing its dependence on the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the start of a steep economic downturn in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," Abigali Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help in rebuilding a war-ravaged country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the start of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country.
Another 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would benefit from the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled throughout the tournament, threw the ball into the water in the 16th hole, leaving the match to Francesca Molinaria.
The Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in every round, becoming one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
Jordan Speith lost 5-4 to Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all time with 25.5 points in his career.
I usually don't cry, but I couldn't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
It's an important team here and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the relay to his countryman John Ram, who beat the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time who has won the 14 greatest titles and only lags behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a way to the hole, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there was a time when we were resisting Europe.
We didn't succeed.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, work with PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to know who's better.
We're overwhelmed."
The latest news about sea-floating: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Mantea and Sarasota.
The latest report by the Florida Fish Conservation and Natural Habitats Commission shows a general decline in sea concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, sporadic flowering has been reported in the areas of Pinellas, Mentee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier - indicating a decrease in concentration.
The area of flowering must be about 130 miles from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
Blooming areas occur about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
The blooming of the sea is also recorded in Pasco County.
In the past week, there have been average concentrations in Pinelas County, low to high concentration in Manatea County, average to high concentration in Sarasota County or its coast, average to mid-centre in Charlotte County, average to high concentration in Lee County or its coast, and low concentration in Collier County.
Cases of airway irritation continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There have been no reports of airway in northwest Florida over the past week.
