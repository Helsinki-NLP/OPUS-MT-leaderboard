Welsh assembly members have expressed their concerns because they will "take them as puppets"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed distress after hearing the suggestion of changing their office name as MWP (Commit of the Welsh Legislative Assembly).
This idea has arisen after developing plans to change its name to the Welsh Legislative Assembly.
The members of the political assembly are worried that plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour Party in the Assembly said, "This new name rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
If you are outside Wales: In Wales, twp means "nozo" and pwp means "cake".
For his part, a member of the Scottish assembly has said that the entire group is "not very happy" and suggested that the replacement names be sought.
Also, a member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that "it is open" to new ideas to change the name, but he has also expressed his concerns for the rhymes that can lead to MWP changes.
In order to better understand this conflict, it must be noted that the Welsh w letters and the English letter u of Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the commission of the assembly, which is creating a legal draft for changes to names, has said, "As for the members of the assembly, they will have the only responsibility to choose the descriptives they want to use."
According to the Welsh government's 2017 Act, the Wales Assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to choose the proposed proposals and generally received many declarations of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name of the Welsh Legislative Assembly or WMP, but the most chosen name MWP was decided in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, on the other hand, suggest replacement options, but it may be extremely difficult to choose a chance unanimously; particularly for the Presidents of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who has had to send a draft for a few weeks with the changes.
However, the legislation of the changes that will be made will affect the functioning of the assembly, among other things, rules will arise to prevent activities that would lead to losing a good name to the members of the Assembly and the design of the assembly system will be managed with the help of that law.
In discussing the change of legislation, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make the decision of the ad in relation to their names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether or not to change the country's name as "The Republic of North Macedonia".
This popular vote has been organized to solve the long account of the last decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The Athenian government has long stressed that the name of the northern neighbour is a revision of its territory and has repeatedly prevented its request to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he is the opponent of the plebiscist to change his name, will ignore the vote.
However, the referendum followers (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say that it is only the price to be paid to enter the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells lose its voice due to the problems that the churches in Harlem
"I have spoken to a number of elderly people and say you could find a bar and a church in every corner a long time ago," Mr. Adams declares.
Today, there is nothing."
He says that Tabern's disappearance is normal.
"People use other methods to socialize," he explains.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms in the neighborhood that were used to bring people together."
As for churches, he is worried that the money obtained for asset sales will not be enough and "we will be at the start point sooner or later."
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and property full of people who do not care about the neighboring shrines.
"People who will buy food housing will be white people," and therefore the churches will close at full speed because these new people are not members of the church congregations."
The congregations of white people built both churches before the Harlem black metropolis; it was an 1870 Metropolitan Community and built St. Martin a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a congregation of black people took over the relay.
Reverendo John Howard Johnson's black congregation took St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against 125 commercial street shops in Harlem, who did not hire or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church suffered a number of damage, but Father Johnson's churchmen designed a number of plans to build the church again and collect the carillo.
Reverendo David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir of St. Martin, named the carilloi "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillo in July gave him another name: "The Treasure of Culture" and "unrepresentable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also stated that he has also been the first carillon hit by a black musician worldwide; the musician, Dionysius A. Lindek, went to play a larger carillo of Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, St. Martin has seen the troublesome departures of several architects and contractors, some of which have been brought by laity leaders or bishopic media.
The parish assembly (a court of artmaking consisting of laical leaders), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocesia in July to verify "the contracts of those people who have created costs will pass to the parish", because the parish has nothing to do with the contracting of architects and contractors sent by the dicess.
Some churchmen have filed their complaints because of the lack of transparency that the diocesis has had.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old child when searching for oysters on the California sea.
Police said on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy when he was looking for oysters on the coast of Californa on the first day of the oyster period.
The attack was before 7 a.m. on the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's KSWB-TV channel in San Diego, he was swimming with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour, but his friend, screaming, heard him ask for help, then swim with a group of people to help his friend out of water.
Hammel thought he was screaming for joy that his friend had found an oyster, but then he realized that his friend was shouting "I was bitten!"
They bit me!
"I could see his whole chalk," Hammel said after seeing his friend.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark!" Hammel explained.
The boy was taken to the hospital for Rady in San Diego and his condition is serious.
The species of shark that attacked could not be detected.
Captain Larry Giles of the Lifeguard membership has presented a report in front of the media and said they have seen a shark a few weeks earlier, but the species was decided that it was not dangerous.
Giles has also stated that the victim's wounds are at the top of the body.
Police have closed access from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Encinitas in order to conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure people's safety.
Giles explained that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans enter the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's supermarket has participated in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers large stores of large stores with a variety of expert and specialized workers.
While sales of fashion and domestic products are decreasing, 2.8 billion francs have been invested in the United Kingdom's beauty sector, which is growing without limit; larger areas of beauty will be built and tested in 11 stores in the country. If good results, they will open in more stores the following year.
Thanks to investments in the beauty area, supermarkets can take advantage of TVs, microwaves and household products.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty products offer will double and offer more than 3000 products; it will also include Revlon, Essie, Tweerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands in the hands of customers.
As for L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more space in branded areas, like areas that can be found in Boots stores.
Furthermore, the supermarket introduces his "Boutique" brand makeup, which is a completely vegan product; younger buyers are increasingly demanding such products.
Furthermore, Fragance Shop will test the amacids offered by the perfume dealer in both Sainsbury's supermarket stores; the first opened in Croydon, south of London last week and the second will open at the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and trends in buying food every day in small local stores, supermarkets must work head and ear to attract customers.
Mike Cuppe, Sainsbury's Supermarkets, has said that sales points will take the style of large stalls and reduce the supermarket chain's threat from time and Lidl competitors by providing more products that are not service and food.
The Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats, after buying the two chains two years ago; for this reason, the sale of food has been strengthened and the chains purchased are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to re-open the series of beauty and medicine, but the strategy failed.
He then joined Sainsbury's Boots in early 2000, but that association ended because the process of breaking the profits from supermarkets into supermarkets had become a burning paper.
A new strategy was organized when the Sainsbury's supermarket sold his 281 shops drug businesses to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, three years ago.
Lloyds will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a large range of luxury brands for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets said, "We have improved the appearance of beauty departments so that our customers can find perfect environments.
We also hired experienced employees to provide detailed advice in terms of products.
We have designed our brand set to meet all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy opportunity in front of shops that use obsolete methods."

The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning program presenters, 37, Instagram was used to present his resignation.
As a result of Holly Willughby's resignation to accept contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, Dragons" The star of the program Peter Jones was extremely angry at leaving the big profit business created between them at the last minute.
According to our sources, a tense meeting was held on Tuesday at Marlowe's main sede and, as a result, Jones was "happy" when he heard the explanation of our most famous woman on TV: that he would accept new 1.5 million francs contracts and therefore could not spend more time in the product and ingredients of the Truly brand.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's worth 11 million francs.
Willoughby, 37, after he had stated on Instagram leaving the Truth brand business, Jones left the United Kingdom to go to a holiday home.
One source said, "This option has always been among Holly's priorities.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us with a full mouth.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just when the brand offer was about to close.
Moreover, Marlowe's residence store is full of products to be sold."
According to experts, the company is about to lose millions of francs for the departure of the host of the program This Morning (which is the most profitable presenter in the United Kingdom); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including cushions, candles, clothing and domestic products) and will have to face delays that can now arise.
This conflict may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and have been close friends at Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe created the Truth brand in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as a director in March.
Both couples always organize their holidays together and Jones has 40 per cent of Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will be the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebry program I'm A Celebrity.
A source of Jones' team last night stated that "didn't say anything about the activities of his business."
A tough conversation, yes, but then "we fell in love"
He was joking about the bad things he had to endure because of the media, all for making a "destegoly" comment on the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so many things?
Trump has used his "TV winner" voice to respond in jackets:
"I didn't give anything."
After his first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said that he wants to organize a second meeting, which has taken a tremendous important step on the road to nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the nuclear disarmament process has stopped.
After three months of meeting in Singapore in June, North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to UN world leaders: in the general assembly on Saturday, North Korea has not seen "appable response" from the United States, with regard to the steps made by the country on the road to nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the penalties imposed by the United States have been hardened in order to maintain pressure in the country.
Trump has a more positive view and has stated such in his last speech.
"Our relationships with North Korea are better than ever," he said.
"Besides, we were about to declare war with North Korea."
That war could kill millions of people.
But now, we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to good results, including tests with missiles have ended, the processes of releasing hostages have improved and the delay of the rest of the United States military is ongoing.
He also explains his unusual point of view, in relation to interviews with Kim.
"The President's job is extremely easy, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to enter the country by force, we have 200 people here," Trump said as he pointed to the personal collected there.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake destroy one island and hundreds of deaths
After the Lombo earthquake, for example, the support of international non-profit organizations was not necessary.
Although 10 per cent of the Lombok population was displaced, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (it is a precondition for demand for aid of the nations).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said it did not require international help, so this situation is a challenge," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children is forming a team that will go to Palura, but he still doesn't know if volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representatives of the agency for national disasters, said Indonesian officers are working in Palun to accept the support of international agencies.
Despite many earthquakes, the country has subdeveloped measures to combat the rage of nature.
Fortresses against tsunamis have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu has no sirens to warn people, and even though the warning is set, perhaps that is why so many dead.
When the weather is good, traveling between the Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters make it difficult to implement logistics.
A hospital ship to provide treatment for earthquake victims was anchored in Lombok and now goes to Palura; however, it will take at least three days to reach the disaster's place.
President Game Widodo's campaign was based on Indonesian infrastructure improvement projects and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funds have been reduced and the administration of the President of the Game is in distress while preparing next year's election.
Also, Mr. Game has trouble controlling the tensions of the Indonesium sects, for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken on a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands have lost their homes because the flags of Christians and Islamic have led their battles to the streets, including maces, bows, arrows, and similar weapons.

The Parliamentary Cremwell State becomes the ultimate goal of the trend of "renewing history"
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed several religious objects, the Puritan fanatics of England did the same with various historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell association, however, says Mr. Crick's suggestion is "that he is trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is an inevitable debate arising from the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside the Palace of Nestminster; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself has never asked or organized the iconaclastisms of civil wars in England.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for his ancestors, Thomas, the actions he had done in the previous century.
The stunning representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the 19th century opinions and our historiography; several people still believe that the actions of this person should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "For fewer people than in the 19th century believe this, yes, but still many people believe that Cromwell was a defender of parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
The substance of historical discussions will remain whether or not it is a precise representation of that person.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has been the starting point of our country's development, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties involved in that starting point.
The title "Lord Protector" may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he had earned."
A pig kills a Chinese farmer.
A pig has attacked and killed a farmer in a southwest China market, according to local media.
The man with the surname "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a cut artery and he was soaked in blood in a pighouse in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post specified on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, pig breeder prepares to insert pigs in Xining in China's Qinghai Province.
Usually, on Wednesdays, Yunnan travels from province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the dead man and saw the door of the neighbouring pork shop open.
He also stated that there was a large male pig with blood in the pig's mouth.
The court analysis report has confirmed that $550 was a pig who killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and crushed." His cousin explained in Guiyang Evening News, whose last name is "Wu".
According to security camera recordings, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Thurday) to feed pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin's swine.
According to what a market boss said to Evening News, the pig is locked up to avoid more attacks and let the police collect evidence of the place.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, some pigs' attacks have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the Massachusetts base, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of £650 surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor until the man's wife drove away the animal.
In 2012, the pigs of a Oregon farmer ate his body, and then a peasant from Manitoba on the CBC News news that your pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, this can function as "acting the agent".
"They love to play.
They're like kids and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa will leave rainstorms in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather, hurricane Rosa is weakening while moving to the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring rainstorms in northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m. Rosa will generate 85 miles per hour wind, and will become a hurricane in the 1st category. According to the Eastern hour, on Sunday, Punta in the southwest of Mexico was found 385 miles from Eugenia.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to go north.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure point is being created in the Pacific Ocean and will move east to the west coasts of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja will go to California's peninsula with a tropical storm and will carry tropical humidity from north to southwest of the United States.
Also, on Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches rain in some parts of Mexico.
After that, tropical humidity will be combined with the low-pressure point and large rainstorms will be created in the south-west in the coming days.
In local places, 1 to 4 inches of dangerous water can be sudden flooding, waste currents, and landfalls can arise in the desert.
Rains produced by large tropical humidity can leave 2-3 inches of water per hour and in specific places, particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 inches of water in the southwest, particularly in Arizona.
Because tropical rains are wandering, they can cause sudden flooding and narrative conditions.
It is not recommended to walk into the desert if a tropical storm has been warned.
Rainstorms can turn rocks into violent streams and storms can lead to seasonal winds and dust.
Also, as pressure will drop, there will be local rainstorms on the southern coasts of California.
Due to rain, half-inch water can be collected and may create small streams of waste and slippery roads.
This can be the first rainy season of the region.
Also, on Sunday and Monday, a few scattered tropical rains can arise in Arizona, but there will be more rainstorms on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rainstorms will go to four corners and expire until Wednesday.
October may have severe temperature changes in the United States, as far as the Arctic lands are cooled, but warm temperatures of the tropics will remain.
Sometimes these temperatures have major changes in short distances.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, between the cities of Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
In the next few days, the warmth of the summer will come and spread everywhere.
The centre and east of the United States will have a warm October; 80 degrees will be temperatures from the southern fields to the north side.
It can also be 80 degrees in New York on Tuesday; it will be approximately 10 degrees than the average temperature.
According to long-term weather forecast, the eastern part of the United States will undergo higher temperatures than the average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people saw in news on Tuesday's sixth channel news by Brett Kavanaugh's candidate and Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Kavanaugh for sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, political conflict continued and channel presenters interrupted Friday's permanent programming to provide a last minute news: Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake agreed to do a week's investigation with the FBI.
According to Ford's magistrate of the Senate, it is quite certain that Kavanaugh had repeatedly touched him while he was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he is absolutely sure that this did not happen.
Nielsen's data said that approximately 20.4 million people were affected by the declaration on Friday.
The company calculated the average of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not immediately available for other channels that issued a declaration, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching television in offices.
For an example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or with the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's declaration is perfectly acceptable for channel presenters and, on average, while he was making a statement that had 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC achieved $2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the declaration, people's interest remained.
Flake was the core of Friday's drama.
After reporting that the office of the moderate Republican Party would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS channel cameras recorded Kavanaugh while trying to take an elevator surrounded by protesters on Friday to declare in the Magistura-bar.
CNN was seen directly on the channel with a look down while the protesters quarreled.
"I'm here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have a terrible power, but so many women have nothing."
At that moment and before the elevator doors were closed, Flake said that his office had published a notification and will provide more details at the meeting's visit.
Cable and television channels were sending the visit directly every hour and meanwhile the Magistura-battle was voting for Senator Kavanaugh.
However, Flake said he would vote after the FBI had examined the arguments against the candidate for a week; remember that the minority Democratic party was being asked to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake was almost convinced in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flak's decision was powerful because the Republican party doesn't have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without doing research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.

Most voters voted for independence, but the participation of the people was very small due to the number of citizens who wanted to boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1000 were injured after the police attack, because voting ships had gone to the election places to stop the voters, so violent strife arose.
Independence groups have camped on Friday to avoid a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the demonstration for independence with his wife, and said that Catalonia no longer has any hope of independence.
"We had a wonderful moment last year.
My parents wept with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After a Pyrric but important victory in the last December local elections, Catalan parties for independence have had many problems in maintaining people's interest this year; several party leaders are either exiled or arrested and are now waiting for a trial for organizing the referendum and declaiming independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic is recording a demonstration for police on his phone and says the politicians of both parties are guilty of this situation.
"There's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been waiting for trial in prison since the year, stated that he would participate in the European Parliament elections organized for the next year.
"If I participate as a candidate in European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the restriction of democratic values and to denounce the repression of the Spanish government."

They also seem to have used a whale in the car.
Thanks to Menga's launch Livingston earns 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal confirms Livingston's height
Livingston, promoted, has impressed players from Rangers and Steven Warrd achieves his second defeat in 18 matches as the leader of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's launch was crucial that Gary Holten's Hibernian team was promoted in the second half.
The Warriors team is out of profit this season in Premiership and will have to play against leader Hearts (who have eight points more) next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is unbeated and there are six games left this season; coach Holt does not know what failure is since he replaced Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston loses several opportunities in front of strong visitors
Holten's team had to get ahead before the goal was scored; as it has tremendous correctness, it caused a number of problems to the Rangers team.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then he redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halket's head.
The hosts were satisfied with letting Rangers play, but they knew visitors could bother them anytime.
And with that mood came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave a free launch and Livingston created an opening space; Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined to mark Menga, but if the latter touched the ball he scored in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game the Rangers dominated the property, but the home defense was inextricable and the janitor Liam Kelly spent the game without any problems.
This model followed to the middle of the second part, but Alfredo Morelos' launch demanded Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not mark the goal for Rangers's goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's other play.
The walks had repeatedly entered Livingston's area and repeatedly pulled out by the domestic players; two penalties were requested, Halkettekt for defiing the representative Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with their hands, but both were rejected.
Livingston's "strange" game - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's game was unique and a perfect result.
They have made extraordinary moves for me and have tremendous good opportunities to climb up.
The style of the games and the team has hardly changed since they reached the top level, but Holdt has been an extraordinary coach: he has set the team straight way since his arrival.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been terrible; he has organized and managed an exceptional defense and, Menga has taken care of making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
Rangers were not very inspired, however.
When they are under the orders of the war, they work very well, but the standards set by the coach have forgotten.
The last move has been too weak and only once they have defeated the defense of their homes; the Rangers team must hurry up if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds opposite welcomes in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan in Germany; the visit was organized to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed some issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and access to Turkey in the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest number of inhabitants in Turkey outside Turkey.
Due to the security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people who wanted to gather in front of the mosque were blocked, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan (most of them were Kurds) brought their voices together to protest against Erdogan's political measures and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
The protesters on both sides reflected the disagreements that the President had aroused; some German Turks say he is a hero and others say he is just an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: a cyclist died from crash with a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m.; that Deptford road in the southeast of the city is usually self-crowded.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died in the place.
On Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver fled.
Metropolitan police are working to identify the man and warn his family.
Some roads have closed and the permanent route of bus lines has changed; motor drivers are also recommended to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in a quarrel
Six prison officers were injured in a fight in men's high-security prison, the prison office said.
The quarrel arose in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 on Sunday morning (BST) and the riots are not yet over.
Expert officers "Tornado" have arrived in prison to end the quarrel started by eight prisoners; for now, it has been limited to a wing of the building.
The officers had minor injuries on their faces and healed them there.
A prison service representative said, "We have sent expert staff of the prison to end the HMP Long Lartin riots.
We have healed six workers for the injuries we have taken.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who have begun to quarrel will deliver them to the police and will probably spend more time among the prison bars."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has over 500 arrests and among them the most violent criminals in the country.
In June, the prison shirt had to go to the hospital for the attack of a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, anti-war officers had to go to prison to stop a serious quarrel, because the prisoners were attacking workers with the sticks of the billiards.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (possibly the most dry areas benefit)
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but that will happen next week while Hurricane Rosa exhausts its strength; it will visit the southwest desert and is at risk of sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already sent a warning about sudden floods that may arise on Monday and Friday; it will enter the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada. It will also pass through the south-east of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be on Monday will make it known to her arrival.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has written in a tweet "from 1950, ten tropical cyclones created 200 miles from Phoenix have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
According to the latest predictions of the national center of hurricanes, they will gather 2-4 inches of water, and will collect up at a maximum of 6 inches of water on the Mogollon shore of Arizona.
As for other areas in the southwest of the desert (the Rocky Mountains and the Great Rock in the middle), 1-2 inches of water will be collected; in isolated places they will meet at most 4 inches.
As for those who expect sudden floods, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because of the droughts experienced by the land.
Floods should not be underestimated, but these rainstorms may be beneficial for droughts that are suffering from the southwest.
According to the United States drought control service, 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from serious droughts, which is the second highest category, the Weather.com site stated.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Mexican Baja Californa Peninsula.
Hurricane Rosa will remain on Sunday morning and will produce a maximum of 85 miles per hour wind; Mexico Punta will then be 385 miles from the south of Eugenia, and will have a speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding colder water in the Pacific and as a result, its power is weakening.
They will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
As there can be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to the Weather.com site, "uri-bards will leave 3-6 inches of water from Baja California to the southwest of Sonora, and may be collecting 10 inches in some places."
Rosa will then pass from northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression during Tuesday morning hours, then cross Arizona and will move south on Tuesday night to Utah.
"The main threats to Rome or its storms are severe storms that will arise in the Bay California, northwest of Sonora and the United States in the southwest desert," said the national hurricane centre.
These rains will produce dangerous sudden floods and debris currents in the deserts and landfalls in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for trying to kill someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man has been arrested for murder effort after finding a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area at 04:00 on Saturday morning (BST).
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18 and a 20-year-old man was arrested that night in the Radstock area (Avon and Somerset), said the police.
If someone has recorded or traces of what happened to the phone, police members have asked for their help.
Trump says Kavanaugh has to endure the "senseless rage" of the Democratic Party.
"The votes given to judge Kavanaugh deny the ruthless and angry tactics of the Democratic party," Trump said in Wheeling, Wet Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh had to endure the "senselessness and rage" of the Democratic Party during his naming process.
On Tuesday Kavanaugh testified before Congress, and completely denied the allegated by Christine Blasey Ford; according to the woman, Kavanaugh raped her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his alleg.
The President said on Saturday: "The citizens of the United States saw that day Kavanaugh's courage, intelligence and quality."
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this jurist has spent his entire life to protect public services," said the president to followers of West Virginia.
Not only about Kavanaugh's appointment, but the President also spoke of the importance of the Republican Party in these elections.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections of our lives.
I won't participate, but I'll campaign," he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight on the perfect candidate."
Trump also said that the Democratic Party is using strategies to "stop and difficult" campaign.
According to CNN by a Republican High Commissioner said, the processing act of voting for Kavanaugh will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami; the number of deaths increases
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis caused by the island of Sulawesi in Indonesium; most of them died while giant waves destroyed the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in Palu, but in the evening the waves of six feet (18 feet) crushed the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything on the way was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"The tsunami threat warning was issued yesterday, but people were still doing a lot of activities on the beach and they didn't run away immediately; that's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in an interview given by the agency to prevent Indonesian disasters (BNPB).
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything in the land," Nugroho says; even the tsunami has traveled through the open sea before reaching the coast with a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h)
"Many people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," said the representative.
Approximately 16,700 people attended the 24 Palu centres.
Several buildings and shops destroyed, a mosque surrounded by the bridge and water can be seen in photographs taken by the disaster agency.
The earthquake replicas continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes were noticed in a territory of 2.4 million people.
According to the report published by the Indonesian Technology validation and application of Technology (BPPT), the energy level released by major earthquakes on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is in a long and narrow bay, is related to the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
According to Nugroho explained, the disaster has been extremely "heated"; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial areas and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims' bodies have been found among the wrecks of the destroyed buildings, which resulted in 540 more injuries and 29 people have disappeared.
Nugroho also said that the number of victims and disaster can be increased along the 300 kilometres (190 miles) coast of Palu; particularly a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
The Donggala media "they don't work and we don't have any information," Nugroho said.
According to the Red Cross data, there are over 300,000 people in that place, for now, they are going to places affected by the organization's employees and volunteers to provide help.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency received strict reviews for not providing information about the tsunami that destroyed Palu, but according to officers, waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a recording shared on social networks, you can see a man in a building, and "snamy is coming" to warn the people of the street.
A few minutes later the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
As the earthquake tsunami has generated general electricity cuts, all the media in Palu has been suspended, so it has been difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has sent support from Jakarta and other cities on cargo planes, but the evacuated still require food and priority goods.
The city's airport has reopened to facilitate support efforts and will be closed to the public until October.
President Game Widodo will visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami leaves more than 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The workers of the World Vision of Donggala have arrived in Palu City without difficulty (the workers there have built olan shelter in the office yard of the organization), but they have seen directly the terrible situation left by the disaster, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw a lot of houses broken," he said.
That's really bad.
Although the support groups began the sad repairs of the work in cases of disasters, some complained of what experienced workers and supporters had given the recommendation not to go to Palura.
Following Indonesian legislation, it can only begin after international funding, supply and workers' supply zone is classified as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster," says Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "OK, is a national disaster," we can open the doors to receive international support, but it has not yet been classified."
The second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palun, the friends and families of those who were still missing had not yet lost the hope that the few probability miracle of appearing their loved ones had not yet been lost.
On Saturday, a small child was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers took out a woman who had been stuck under the ruins for two days, with her mother's body by his side.
Gendon Subandono, coaching of the Indonesian nation's parapete team trained two of the parapentists who were part of the missing Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi Jn., were students.
"As an expert in the world of Paradise, I have an emotional charge," he said.
Gendon Jn. explained that since they reported in the parapentists community about the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel in the following hours, WhatsApp messages had been sending to competitors, which were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only one gray arrow, had no two blue marks.
"I think that means those messages weren't sent," he added.

Kanye West: Rapero changed its name, Yes is now
The rapper Kanye West has changed its name - Yes is now.
On Saturday he announced the change on Twitter: "The creature known as Kansas West."
West, aged 41, has used the name Ye for a time, and has used this nickname as a title to his eighth album he has released in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, as no was expected to present his latest album Yandhi.
He took part in the show instead of Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, could not participate as a result of "the emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and "you" in the Bible," West recently stated, talking to the album with the big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means only one, to become Ye- becoming a reflection of our good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This work reflects better who we are."
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
We also met Sean Combs as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has stated that she prefers the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly collaborated with West, has also changed the hyphen and serious letters.
Mexican AMLO has promised not to use the army against citizens
The president elected in Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised not to use armed force or army against the citizens when the country will live the 50th anniversary of a repression that was shed against students.
Lopez Obrador swore on Saturday that he will never use the army to repress Mexican citizens."
On October 2, 1968, the army shot against a peaceful appearance in the square, and 300 people were killed to interrupt the rise of left-wing students who were taking strength throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn, opening up with monthly subsidies and more free public universities.
In his words, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double the funding of the AA
Since China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it uses to research in that area, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AAn expert, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arose when several U.S. government parties made a number of notifications about the AA, although the US generally does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in innovation by 2030.
"Beaching research would be a good start, as other countries are far from the US and are looking for the next discovery in AAA," Lee said.
Double funding in the US can double the chances of making the AA large discoveries, Lee stated to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is Director General of Synovation Ventures, who has researched in one of the most important companies in China's AA, Face+.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AA system that passed high-level Othello player in America and later worked as executives at Microsoft Research, and was the president of Google in the Chinese field.
Lee praised the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, including the Robotic Competition of the Defense Projects Advanced Research Agency, and asked when it will be next to help identify the next dreamers.
US researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, says Lee.
"It doesn't mean China takes academic leaders, they're companies," Lee added.
Facebook, Google and many other technology companies have taken the most clears from universities to act in the AA in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies would also help the U.S. to encourage AA activities.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of the AA," he stated.
The Chinese State Council in July 2017 issued the Development Plan of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation finances people from academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government institutions do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is less, Lee says.
That year, earlier, the U.S. Department of Defense founded an Artificial Intelligence Center where industry and educational partners gathered, and the White House reported that the White House had formed the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA has reported a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As for NSF, it invests more than $100 million a day in the AA research.
Meanwhile, EU legislation aimed at the formation of the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in the last few months.
Macedonians had a referendum to decide whether to change or not change the country's name.
The country of Macedonia voted by referendum on Sunday to decide whether or not to change the name "Old Macedonian republic". This change would end the conflict of several decades since the possibility of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO since Greece blocked it.
Greece, formerly a province called Macedonia, says that the name of the northern residents still occupies its territory, and blocks the possibility of its access to NATO and the EU.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents say that this change is to harm the ethnic identity of most Slavic citizens in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott that the campaign caused doubts about 50 per cent that will be achieved in the referendum to be valid.
The question that could be read on the paper of the referendum is, "Are you in favor of being a member of the Greek agreement?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth getting the opportunity to join the EU and NATO organizations for Macedonia, being one of the countries created when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I come to vote about the future of the country, for the young men of Macedonia, because under the European Union umbrella that will lead us a safer life," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, sufficient members of the parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to be decisive.
It will take three-thirds of the parliament to change the name.
The state selection committee stated that no news of surprises had been reported until one o'clock in noon.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to 34 per cent of the last election for the 2016 parliament, in which 66 per cent of those who had the right to vote voted.
"I went to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, in the capital, Skopje voter.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Fortune and son Dushko in favour of changing their votes in the referendum of Macedonia and the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small scenario and stairs to climb in front of shops who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of the EU and the EU, but we want to meet with our conditions and not in the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the union of Euro-Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO may lead to investment so necessary to Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.
"I think most will be on the side, because more than 80 percent of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev declared after voting.
In his words, saying "yes" would "confirmed our future".
According to the poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Organization on Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the vote - less than necessary.
Another poll, Telma TV in Macedonia, said 57 per cent of residents thought of voting on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent stated that he would leave.
To make the referendum successful, 50 percent plus one vote must be achieved in favor.
If there was a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious error of politics for the West since it began in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero overcome Brighton's defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed Brighton's entire defense at Manchester City's Saturday 2-0 win, Etihad Stadium on the football field in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored the goal he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine Gol-maker received a walk in the middle of the field at the beginning of the move.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton before entering the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender after escaping from several others on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he walked to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward returned the ball into the first touch to Aguero inside the area, who used his right foot with the launch aimed at the right side of the network to overcome Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"There are a lot of problems at the foot of the weather," the City coach told reporters, Pep Guardiola.
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were very happy to have scored the goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave the blue shirts the initial advantage of the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in Brighton's field in the move.
He gave Leroy Sane a great walk on the left side.
San made a few touches before directing Sterling to the remote post.
The blue-seater pushed the ball to the net before leaving the line.
City Hoffenheim will compete against the Champions League competition on Tuesday at 12:55 noon on the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin Rockie's end
With the Nationals expelled from the competition, there was not much reason to force them to another beginning.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to make an advantage against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but Rockie still experience the effects of equality, which still have the advantage of a game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
Rockie got a wildcard by winning at least 5-2 to Nationalei on Friday night, but they will still have to try to win the first first title.
"Even if we play for anything, we know that the Denver atmosphere will be crowded, and that the opposite team will play at the best level in every area we will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher, but it seems they will let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th warning, made a launch show on Thursday and it seems like it would be to act as a shooter on Sunday.
Washington's right hand has reached 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this year.
Trump's statements in West Virginia
The president examined the situation above the situation and mentioned the situation about Brett Kavanaugh, chosen by the Supreme Court himself, when he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-time election.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We have five weeks of the most important elections in our lives.
He's one of the biggest -- I'm not a candidate but I'm actually a candidate, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for that," he stated.
Trump added, "You can see the terrible Democrats' extreme team, you can now see what's happening.
And they have no doubt about removing the power to use any resources necessary, see greed, see the iguability.
It doesn't matter who to hurt, over whom to get control and power, then we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, are "to eat and hinder".
"As you could see in the last four days," he added that the Democrats are "too angry and wise and disgusting and false."
He registered by Dianne Feinstein, a Senator for the Democratic Party, of the Senate Court Committee, who received the cries of the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what.
No, ah, no, I'm waiting for one - that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labourers will not continue to have a great reach.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When my local party activists voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I am the last of the list that we weren't welcome from the Labour MPs - for saying what we all thought.
Joan Ryan, who is a member of Parliament, also received similar treatment because he spoke for antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, in national security, Europe, Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders in similar matters.
The news about Friday's East Nottingham meeting said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Over the eight years I have been carrying as a local Labour MP, that was Friday night's GC meetings.
Unfortunately, today, it has not been remembered to make the word "friendly, respectful" policy, if ever there has been.
It is becoming apparent that there are different views in the Labour Party and whether opinions are acceptable to the leaders of the party are judged.
This began when Jeremy became a leader, when the members who had the same political views before began to turn 180 degrees and demand to accept views that I would never accept - both with regard to national security and one EU market.
Every time I spoke in public - it doesn't matter what I said - a lot of opinions that accuse middle policies on social networks and ask them to remove me from it, persecution, is, in terms of those who say I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
I know I'm better luck than some of my colleagues because the opinions thrown against me are political.
Every day I am subject to friends who are to face sexism or racial harassment with professionalism and sincerity, but never with shame.
One of the unpleasant aspects of the policy of this period is that the current level of persecution is given as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week stated that the Labour Party should promote the culture of tolerance.
We really don't get a single opinion when they become closer in every motion of "unconfiance" or the rules of the party.
Over the past two years I have received so many notes to lower my head, not to talk so much, and thus saying, "I would be good."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I abandoned the room under the indifference of Thatcher's government and entered public services that needed me most - as a local councillor or minister of government.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will hesitate about my political points of view and about my disagreements with current leaders.
I would tell those who promoted the motion of Friday when the country is addressing Brexit that will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the loss of time and energy when discussing my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to encourage Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether or not they are a member of the Labour Party: I am very proud to work for you and I promise you from continuing to work for what is best for your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is the leader who has not yet lost a game
The two last surprise attempts somehow changed the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in the day game of the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship.
They are in first place of the board, and are the only ones who have not lost one in ten games.
At the end, they had better defense, and they took better advantage of the opportunities, the home and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be happy.
"We have been tested so far, and we haven't lost one, so we must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melros added, "My honors to Ayr, because they used opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, carried out by Frazier Clymo, had previously placed Ayr, but the yellow card taken from Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, left by Warriors for the game, allowed Melros to add points and Jason Baggot failed to carry out the attempt.
Climo checked the leader of Ayr by penalty. Before, at the end of the first part, he carried out his solo rehearsal and Ayr 17-5 went to the break.
But Melrose started beautifully in the second part and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, carried out by Baggot, reduced the difference five points.
Then there has been a long break because of the serious injury of player Ruitdh Knott, who was taken out on his hand bed and, upon his return to the game Ayr reached Stafford McDowall's rehearsal when Climo turned it.
Then, Captain Blair Macpherson Ayr brought out a yellow card and again Melros benefited from being more a man, with Bruce Colvine's rehearsal that had not taken place, a living end.
The family returned and, when the yellow card was taken out in Struan Hutchinson to prevent Clomo ball from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the Ayr group's maula that was moving forward.
Climo spat, as he had done almost from the beginning, Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's kick and kicked Gregor Henry out of the fifth rehearsal of the household.
The star of the Still Game series will start a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that actor Ford Kieran wants to jump into the host world, who has been known to have been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis's famous BBC show, whose writer and one of the stars has long been a member with Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the last of the show will be the next season, the ninth, and seems to be planning the life after Kiernan Craiglangen.
According to official records, he is the director of Addiftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to express anything about the story, although the sources of Scottish Sun said he wanted to enter a "mark of important guitars" in Kiernan Glasgow."
‘The sea is ours': Bolivian in the interior hopes that the courts re-open the road to the Pacific
Seamen patrol boat equipment coverage headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca you can read the following motto on board bases for Amazon: "The sea is ours by right.
To restore it is our duty."
During the interior Bolivia, the 19th-century Chilean coastal conflict of a wide variety of blood emissions still survive - as they continue to sail in the Pacific Ocean again.
These expectations are perhaps stronger than in the last few decades, because Bolivia hopes to solve international courts after five years of reflection on October 1.
"Bolivia experiences the right time, with the sense of unity and tranquility, and of course he is optimistic about the result," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will continue the decision of the international court through giant screens distributed throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give reason to Bolivia's demands - after the negotiation that has lasted decades - Chile has been forced to negotiate about giving Bolivia the sovereign road to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charming indigenous president of Bolivia - who is involved in the conflict to be re-elected next year - has also made several contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, on the other hand, believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia, and consequently not much will change.
The United Nations organization located in the Netherlands has no power to give Chile territory and has stated that it will not decide on the results of the possible negotiations.
The International Court's ruling six months after negotiations have ended negotiations indicates that the case was "not difficult," Paz Zarat said, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than promote the cause of Bolivia, they have gone backwards for the last four years.
"The theme of reaching the sea has been taken as a captive by the current Bolivian administration," Zarat said.
The viligerant rhetoric of President Morales has ruined all the desire to do well in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile still have to deal with a variety of topics, but it will be very difficult to continue discussing after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in Hague, disagrees with those who say the court's resolution is particularly rapid.
On Monday Bolivia "will have an excellent opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both."
Calzadilla stated that Morales disagrees - one of the popular presidents of South America - who say he uses the sea problem to achieve political support.
"Bolivia will never refuse the right to have a way to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is the opportunity we had to see to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can believe in the US
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
Rik stated this before the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States at the summit of Singapore in front of the enemy leaders to fulfill his promise.
He stated that this is on the border of reblocking nuclear diplomacy with Mike Pompeo Singapore, North Korean Kim Jong Un for more than three months.
Ri says it is "utopia" to think that continuous penalties and the end statement of the Korean War will put North Korea at his feet.
Washington does not want to agree on confession before Pyongyang moves to exclude weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is a very great skepticism that Pyongyang is the only way to ensure its security that the country seems to be serious about giving up all weapons.
Pompeo's plan is to go to Pyongyanger next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show on the road to High Street next to you shows the newest line of massive hats
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want to completely block the sun, here is the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of large-sized strange hats in the spring summer collection of 2019, which left the style shown in the Paris Fashion Week trembling.
This summer hats have arrived on Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the passage.
Valentino's most prominent piece, with a beix-colored hat pen-like wing, covered the heads of models.
Among other high-sized supplements we have angurri full of jewelry, a rather strange hat, and also a kind of pin - but they are not designs to warm your head.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - on time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have lips lined up and they look like Hannibal Lecter's rather than high tailors.
One looked like a diving mask with glasses and pipe, while another looked like a melted ice cream cuckoo.
If you are a fashion follower, you have good news.
Experts in style say the deaf will go out into the street, even to your surroundings.
Large-sized hats come after ‘La Bomba', a two-foot wide wing straw hat, which we have seen from Rihanna and dressed to many famous people until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the hat which has not been successful in social networks has led another object to the passage - the straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the bathing suit model that carries it.
The raffic orange bag, cut with raffic ash and white leather handle has been finished in Jacqueline La Riviera 2019 Spring summer collection.
The Stilist Luke Armimage celebrit said at FEMAIL, "I hope that big hats and large beach bags reach the main streets next summer, with the great echo the designer has had would be difficult to ignore the demand for giant supplements."
John Edward: Basic language capabilities for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland make records of academic excellence, and have continued in 2018, apart from the results of the exams, which have been consolidated with both individual and group excellent results in sports, including music and other community projects.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, replaced by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, these schools try to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, a career chosen by them, and as citizens.
As we can design and implement the custom school curriculum as a educational sector, we have seen that modern languages remain the usual choice chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language that understands, you'll get to himself.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
It is a strong way to remind us that we don't have to use English only to build relationships with other countries and gain confidence in them.
From the results of this year's latest exams we can see that there are languages in the top part of the most overcome in independent schools.
68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have achieved the best classification A.
The data, collected at SCIS's 74 student school, shows that 72 per cent of students obtained the best classification in Chinese Mandarin; 72 per cent in German; 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland certainly see foreign languages as indispensable skills that young people and children will need in the future.
Languages are now worked as a teaching axis (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools curriculums as well as others.
In 2014, one of the main reasons found that one of the main reasons found at the time of filling the job was that language was non-knowledged.
More and more, knowing languages is becoming indispensable to preparing young people for future careers.
With more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are vital in the globalized world.
Whatever the chosen career, if they have learned the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifetime advantage.
Being able to talk directly to people in foreign countries will automatically put the multi-minded person at the head of the competition.
According to YouGov's poll to 4,000 EU adults in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak foreign language, in a way that it was a common conversation, and among those who spoke French only rose to a two-digit figure, 15 per cent.
That is why it is so important to invest in teaching languages in today's children.
Talking more than one language, which are mostly used in economic developments, will give your children more opportunities to find better employment.
In Scotland, schools differ according to the language they teach.
A number of students prefer more classic modern languages, and others seem to be important to the EU, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
As those of your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of language opportunities to learn in independent school with teachers who are experts in the field.
The aim of independent Scottish schools is to prepare children to succeed in different tasks in the future and provide tools for it.
This time we cannot deny, in an international business environment, where languages are vital to the future of the country, so there is a need for reflection in education.
Modern languages should be understood as "international communication capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunities, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with Lakers on Monday in San Diego
LeBron James is about to finish waiting for fans to debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has stated that James will play on Monday's preseason match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he has not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"More than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' journalist Mike Trudell stated on Twitter that James will play with limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked at Lakers about six pre-season programming.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare at this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin the rally campaign ball tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five rallys for Trump's next week, and will visit several places he has friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for the vote that would give him confirmation to fill the Supreme Court square, Trump wants to gain support or support for elections that will be in the middle term as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in November elections.
What time is Trump's blog in West Virginia and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's tour is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. in West Virginia today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view Trump's mitine online in West Virginia via stream on YouTube.
Trump seems to direct the hearings of the appointed Bret Kavanaugh of this week's Supreme Court until the confirmation of the Senate that has held the vote during the inappropriate sexual attitude of the FBI's investigation.
But the main objective of this mitin tour is to help Republicans win a few votes in the November elections.
President Trump's campaign therefore states that the purpose of these five myths next week is to "recovery the voluntaries and support the majority of the Republicans in the Senate and at the House of Representatives" according to Reuters.
"The Congressional Congress is of paramount importance and the President will travel to as many states as they enter the campaign session," Trump's campaign spokesman said, who did not allow the Reuters agency to register.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will allow current mitina to support followers of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and the Pittsburg media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump will visit West Virginia last month, the state won by 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republicans of Virginia, who is following.
It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to go there to help in elections," says Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team will try to continue in the Sunday individual competition
After three sessions on one side, it was said that Saturday afternoon four was needed by this Ryder Cup.
The key to the moment is a concept of sport invented from top to bottom in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say that the time is now?
"They had six points advantage and now they have four, so I think it's the time, in a way," said Jordan Spieth, doing a day's area.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points, from twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and need help, mostly Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points from four.
Spieth has been absolutely crucial, from draw to green, and is directing with the model.
These screams of celebrating have become louder and louder as the shifts progressed, and it has brought the important putt, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated in the 15th game with another puff-like scream, which indicates that the American team is not outside the competition.
"You have to look for strength and take care of your game only," Spieth said.
It's what those players stop.
18 holes to take out.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood, the historic players of the Ryder Cup tournament.
The special but charming European couples are four out of four who have sworn to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't throw a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but Saturday morning, they also avoided bogeys on Friday afternoon and the last nine on Friday.
This turn and the energy that reached them towards the noisy crowd and became a couple to be overcome on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina when the sun rises to close Europe's victory at Le Golf National.
It's better if the two are in different holes together.
It is early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio García's work, best of the four, when Alex was equal to whom Alex was equal to.
One and two doubles have been placed in the hole that was never too close to defeat the Spanish and Swedish.
However, on Sunday, there was no one to help out of your hole.
The four was fascinated to see the interaction between couples closely, the advice they gave, which they did not give, and how the strategy can change at one point.
Europe played better as a team, and had a remarkable advantage for the final, but the four-fold session showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, though some in particular Stateside have been questioned.
Europe achieves 10-6 advantage in Ryder Cup final
Europe has issued a significant advantage in the Ryder Cup final, after getting Saturday fours against the United States of America 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina had won two victories against Tiger Woods, and they scored four valuable points so far at the Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn in Europe, trying to regain the lost prize in Hazel two years ago, was dominant in the morning, and won 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered greater resistance, and won two games, but could not exceed the difference.
It took Jim Furyk's side eight points to hold the prize in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie that has won four points in a row and along with Molina, which are called "Mulliwood" after a magnificent weekend, are second by winning four points in the history of the Ryder Cup tournament.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs, he completed the game beautifully with the tired Woods and Bryson Dechambeau over American roulette with 5 and 4 light.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturday in some way, showed touches of excellence, but lost 19 out of 29 games in heartballs and phosphates, 7 in a row.
Justin Rose rested for morning tourballs and returned with Henrik Stenson to defeat 2&1 in the fours to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best and third in the world.
Europe did not find its way on a pleasant, cool, cool day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spiethee and Justin Thomase won three times set a reference for Americans, two points on Saturday.
They won a vague 2-1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and then Poulter and Rory McIlroy after losing two initial holes in the 4&3 tiles.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has managed to overcome the four-point difference and enter individual parts, although Furyk's side only needed a draw to hold the prize.
After being the second best in two days, after the Sunday opposite formation, they will be placed before him.
North Korea has given a round negative to leave arms without any confidence.
The foreign minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to inhibit confidence in the United States and will not, in such a situation, in any way, cease to make nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world organization's annual plenary meeting that North Korea took "a significant measures of good intentions" last year, interrupting nuclear weapons and missile tests, leaving places for nuclear tests, and to talk about what will stop developing technology and nuclear weapons.
"However, we don't see the right answer on the US side," he said.
"Without the confidence of the U.S. there is no trust in our national security and, in any way, we cannot leave the first weapons alone."
Rik Washington's resistance to North Korea repeats family complaints within a "phase" process for denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking steps. His statements seem significant to have not rejected the unilateral denuclearization of Pyongyang in the past.
Rik Kim Jong Dure and Donald Trump mentions the first summit of President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Kim promised to "dequalify the Core Peninsula", and Trump swore to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is looking for a formal way to end the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States of America has stated that Pyongyang must leave the first weapons.
Washington has ignored international voices that require relief of the sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. again says it will have to leave the first weapons and increase the level of pressure of punishment, in order to force them to achieve their goal, and it is against the "end expression of war," Rik said.
"The thought that the circus will put us at their feet is the utopia of those who do not know us.
The problem is that continuous penalties are increasing their discofiance."
Rike has not mentioned the second summit between Kim et Trump announced in the early week by U.S. leaders in the United Nations.
The minister, on the other hand, has mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae and added, "If the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked."
However, Ri's speech tone would be completely different last year, where he stated that North Korea was inevitably facing missiles in the United States since he called Kim "Mr. Miss President" on the suicidal mission.
This year, Trump, in front of the United Nations, declared that he would "small" North Korea, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to exclude weapons, but stated that it was still necessary and that they would continue with punishment until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he was not in time for this, "even if it's two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, stated in front of the NB Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to strengthen the sanctions of the Security Council, without fail, until we verify that its denuclearization is real."
The Security Council has unanimously encouraged North Korea as an attempt to block funding nuclear and ballistic programs in Pyongyang since 2006.
Pompeo Ri met outside the NBC plenary meeting and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has been in North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not work.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July saying that something had been achieved for North Korea, after he reported that during hours this was "asking the demands that the gangsters make."
North Korea swore at a meeting with Moon that at a meeting with Moon they would leave places and a nuclear complex if the United States take the measures corresponding to them."
He told Kim that Trump was looking for the "measures" of security that Trump was engaged in Singapore and directed towards normalization of relationships with Washington.
Harvard students have taken a course of sufficient rest.
This year's Harvard University school year will sleep more than subgrades to try to deal with the increasingly widespread culture of those who learn by drinking coffee for the night.
A teacher saw that at the best university in the world students are lost in a basic way of taking care of themselves.
Charles Cereisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist in Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the course, which believes that he is the first such in the EU.
When he gave a speech on the influence of sleep deficiency during his learning time, he began the course.
"When I finished a girl came up to me and said, "Why should I do that alone now, in the last year of my school?"
He said no one had told him how important it is to sleep well, which surprised me," said Telegraph.
In the course, offered this year, students are explained to students the impact of appropriate sleep habits on studies and sports results, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and university health services, stated that the university decided to start the course when students saw that he slept little during the week.
The long-hour course takes on a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom in which students press coffee vessels, curtains, coaches and books to see the effect of caffeine and light, and to see the effect of sleep too little on sports performance and realize the importance of the habits of sleeping.
In another section, participants are explained to those who sleep too little sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, and can increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On a map of campus, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on everyday habits.
"We know we're not going to change the students' habits suddenly.
But we think they have the right to know that if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as you have the right to know the consequences that will have on your health," added Cereisler.
There is still a culture of pride for "night", he says, and the increasingly pressure affected by modern technologies and students increases the problem of doing little o.
Sleep well, with good quality sleep, should be "secret weapon to deal with stress, fatigue, and nervousness," he said - even to gain weight because little sleep makes the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology has helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and one of his first classes in Harvard.
He stated that the course had opened his eyes and urged him to participate in a course that took on campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask the graduates to do a similar investigation before entering the competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set alarm to determine when to go to bed, and to wake up, and to know the effects of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can change circadian rhythms and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga has overcome Gerrard's men
Rangers have suffered another defeat by Dolly Menga's strips set up 1-0 for Steven Wardston.
They wanted to win the first time after winning 4-1 St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holde's team caused the Second defeat of the Warr's team as a coach in his 18th game, allowing his eight points to escape without control by the leader of the Landbrokes Championship.
Menga had gin seven minutes before the stripie break, and Rangers' work did not get a draw.
Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has risen to third and are only on the goal side behind Hibernian.
The problem could have been more serious for Rangers because the Calum Spence wing had to be treated for a headache wound because it was hit by an object that was thrown outside.
The Warrd made eight changes and managed to reach the semi-finals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, Livi 11 went with him, who took a point from Hearts last week and would be happy to see how his well-fit clothes drowned his opponents each round.
Rangers dominated property, but Livingston benefited their moves more.
Scott Pittmani of the Menga's wing should be scored through Allan McGregor but the middleman did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free launch of Keaghan Jacobs discovered Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow managed to get away to the back post.
Rangers took control, but in the last third, hope seemed to be greater than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should be a penalty on the quarter's border, when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson did not take into account the appeals of the Colombian.
Rangers managed to make only two shots out in the first half, but former goalkeeper in Ibrox Liam Kelly had almost no problem with Lassana Colibalia and the light blow of Ovie Ejaria.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the development of the game, but no one can deny that they deserved their great effort.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with a Jacobs stop ball move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Warrd took over the break by changing with Colibally Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect when the wingman passed to Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game after long walks by Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase his advantage, but McGregor held him firmly before he made a blow from the Lithgow court.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, asked for a penalty again at the end when he got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson never listened to him again.
Alman by: Geiger counter inventor
And now one page of our "Sunday Morning" almanaka: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA AURRERA ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity: after this invention came what was called the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has been a landmark in science, and has also become a landmark in pop culture, as in 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", the cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were the protagonists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Giger is a counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "Yes, you can hear it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, with a few days left for the age of 63.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach evil cells ‘see' to the immune system
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to ‘see' and kill evil cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to know the evil cells within treatment.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and then alternating them in the laboratory
Then they can see a common protein in many cancers and then reject it.
The test vaccine is giving very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
To a woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to know the evil cells, they managed to disappear for more than 18 months of ovarian cancer.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and alternating them in the laboratory, so that for many called HER2 a protein that is common to "see" cancer, and then in rejecting cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, United States, said, "Our results show that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 "promiss the growth of cancers of various types," including breast, ovary, lung and colon and onset cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach that consists of taking immune cells from patients and how to reach carcinogenic cells in "learning" has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye entered a diva for West Trump, wearing a MAG hat after the SNL appearance.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was shouted in the studio at a Saturday Night Live when he praised President Donald Trump and said he would run back to president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak ill against the Democrats and confirmed Trump's position.
"Every time I talk to a white person they say to me, "How do you like Trump, because he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have been away from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of the lead Matt Damon. In this Skech, with regard to the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, Brett Kavanaugh mocked the stars of Hollywood with witness to the Senate's Judicial Committee.
Although not sent, West's offensive speech was promoted to social networks by the comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock West was trying to make fun of publishing.
He also complained in front of the public West that he had had a bad time between his wings because of his hat.
"I have been attacked among the wings.
I was told, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a bottom place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, saying, "Do you want to see the spot that's ruined?" "I'll wear my superman's cloak, because that means you can't tell me what I have to do, you want the world to move on?
Try love."
As a result of his words whistles came from the public at least a couple of times and the SNL session members seemed to be ashamed, Variety reported, and a person there said to the magazine, "The whole sentence remained completely silent."
West was brought in to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute, for his boyfriend had died a few days earlier, rapper Rac Miller.
The web surprised many people with the interpretation of the song I love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of Candace Turner, led by the Conservative group of TPUSA, who published this tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: thank you for the sake of the PREFI."
But as Karen Hunter tweeted by Karen Hunter, West was simply "he was being what he is and that's wonderful."
"But I don't want to reward a person who makes an ideology that is harmful to the community (using his music or clothes or protecting his "art".
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it is now "the creature whose name was Kanye West so far."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His partner Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, and how not to mention Prince the legend of music, who changed his name to a symbol and made the artist Prince up to that time.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has opposed toxic masculinity
Kit Harington Jon Snow is known for the role of swordsman Game of Thrones HBO in the medieval fantasy series of Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has opposed the stereotype of the machinist hero, stating that due to the appearance of such papers on the screen, young boys often feel hard to be respected.
In his statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something has been done wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during #MeToo.
Kit is also a star of Game of Thrones and also married Rose Leslie recently, who is 31 years old, and admitted that she must face the ‘believed' problem.
"Personally, and with great certainty, I think at this moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing, considering the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also have its responsibility in terms of the increase in toxic masculinity, due to being very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, which makes young boys feel like that way of being a man should do their own?
I think that's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
It's obvious that something went wrong for young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make any prior or successor to Game of Thrones when the series ends the next summer, and said that he has ‘mothered with battlefields and horses'.
From November on Kit Sam Shepard's return to True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother; his brother is a thief.
The actor recently announced that the fact that he had met his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has given him.
"I met my wife in this session, and so she gave me my future family and life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygrotte, the woman whom Kit's character Jon Snow loves, won the Emmy Award in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family settlement in Scotland.
HIV/Hiesa: China reports that there has been a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 80,000 people in the country, the health authorities have said.
More than 40,000 new cases have been recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are transmitted by sex, which is a change to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly due to blood transfusions infected in some parts of China.
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to nearly zero, as Chinese health authorities said at a Yunnan provincial conference.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China have increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to conservative values in the country, it has been estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman.
Many diseases transmissions are due to using inappropriate sexual protections in contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to HIV medication within the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied data from leaking workers' GOP Senators and has turned them upside down the ' Dangerous Lies' and ‘comnspiration theories'.
U.S. ord. Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that one member of his staff published personal information from three Republican senators in the United States on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Democrats in Los Angeles have stated that the assertions were driven by experts and websites of "ultraright-wing".
"More lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published was information from three US senators: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a hearing of the inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate of the Supreme Court of the Senate Commission.
The plot came later after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source was associated with Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' staff, Hill stated.
"That unheard all-sidious allegations is completely false and a complete lie," Waters continued.
"My staff members - who have been compromised by identity, personal information and security as a result of these false fraud allegations - has no responsibility in terms of leaking of this information.
The unfounded claim is completely false and a complete lie."
Waters' statement immediately received reviews online, such as Ari Fleischer, a former White House press writer.
"That denial is done from anger," Fleischer wrote.
"That shows that he has no character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is charged with something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
He doesn't have to show a challenge attitude.
He should not question the reasons for the accuser.
He must appear calm and conveniently."
Fleischer seemed to want to compare Waters' reaction with the criticism of Democrats to judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at the hearing of Thursday.
Omar Navarro, also a republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the central legislative election, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"If the meaningful is true," he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said that he had warned his offices "as far as the authorities and the law enforcement entities concerned these fraudulent statements.
"We make sure that those who have broken the law will know," he continued, "and that they will have to respond before the law for any member of my staff and every act that is harmful and dangerous to all members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - parody of small-power spy Rowan Atkinson
Now it has become traditional to seek the meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British ray, and this seems not applicable to the parody franchise of Johnny English action comedy.It started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we certainly get a new export opportunity for our nation by making the satisfaction of ourselves?
In any case, Johnny English with large eyes and rubber faces renewed his license to ruin things for the second time: his name shows above everything that is only a broad comic creation designed for territories that see not English cinema.
Despite being a special desire to achieve flattering Glamour, he is of course a stupid secret agent who looks a little like Clouseu, and a little bit of the boy who helps Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In Barclaycard's television commercials we've already forgotten, Atkinson is also based on the mysterious international man, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two major moments in this last round of JE.
I loved how Johnny English approached the helicopter with a medieval armor and that the rotor crosses beat him in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is seen on the screen, but humor lacks strength and it's too superfluo, especially when the "sic" film marks like 007 and Mission Impossible are now included in comedy among their components.
Humor seems more to children than aimed at adults, and for me Johnny English-eni absurd adventures are not as intelligent and clear as the jokes of Bean character in Atkinson's silent films.
The topical premise is now that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated in the super-secret web network of British spies, revealing the personalities of all British agents working, and is upset by the agent in the service. Unfortunately small paper for Kevin Eldon.
That's too much for a prime minister with a ponposo and persecuted character, who is already losing political reputation: Emma Thompson gives the best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help too much.
His intelligence advisers inform him that as all active spies have been compromised that someone in retirement will have to recover.
And that means walking as Johnny English himself can. Now he's a teacher in a fancy place, but he's giving confidential schools about acting as a secret operational: there are some nice jokes there, because English offers a spy-academy of type ‘School of Rock'.
English is again brought to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting, and meets again with his former member Bugh. Again Ben Miller interprets this character.
Buugh is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine is lost in that role in the style of a little rich man.
So in the Batman and Robin action of making things miserable in Your Highness's Secret Service, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful phemme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is fascinated by the technological billionaire who says he can solve British informal misfortunes. Jason Volta is malicious, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their farce adventures: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant. They create chaos by secretly entering Volta's luxury yacht, and English raises complete anarchy when trying to use virtual reality helmets to go see what Volta's house is like inside.
All stops look at this last sequence, but despite being nice and noisy, it all has a lot from children's television.
Such a thing.
And as it happened to me with other Johnny English films, this is what comes to mind: can't Rowan Atkinson give the British film industry a paper worth his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are working on a week of four days but is preparing a plan to collect five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is studying a radical plan that the British are working on a week of friends but predicting to collect five days.
The party seems to want the employers to give to workers what they have saved through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them a more holiday.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take the same salary home.
Sources have stated that the idea is ‘well' on the economic agenda of the party and that it wants to put the country on the workers' side.
Spending a week of four working days has been supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way that workers profit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party has stated to The Sunday Times: 'It is anticipated to announce a policy resolution before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to day, but a week of four working days matches the party's view of re-establishing the economy for the worker, and also with the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be a party that protects such an idea, as the Green Party defended a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
In any case, the aspiration has not yet been supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's voter has stated: "Four days of work week is not the party's policy, and the party does not take that into account."
Minister John McDonnell, who is in the shadow, used the Labour Party's congress last week to determine its view of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that 'unfaceed directors' and 'speculators' should be deprived of power in companies that offered public services.
On the shadow minister's planet, in addition, current shareholders in water companies may not receive their full share, because a Labour government can make subtractions if seen that there has been a wrong behavior.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to access workers in companies and create inclusive Property Funds to provide 10% of the capital of private sector companies, which can collect annual dividends of between £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy call "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation with regard to the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his appointment for the Supreme Court, and has put the doubt on the table whether the effects of the investigation could lead to the removal of his protection by some republican senator.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent at "60 Minutes", asked the republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could make anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open than his fellow-party in South Carolina.
"I think so, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the claim was revealed, I said, "You did that?"
He answered with horror, clearly, no doubt."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be written on stone.
"I have decided in terms of Brett Kavanaugh and would also suffer the accusation that would cause an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it with all firmness," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who speaks of him has not been able to verify this.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that brings great artists and has a huge mission: to eradicate world poverty.
With the seventeenth edition this time, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Field of Central Park, not just to enjoy the performances of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event, i.e., to eradicate extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. This project is an international team that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight poverty.
To receive a free entry for the event (if you are not willing to pay a ticket), those who wish to go to the concert must perform a variety of tasks or "actions" such as sending an email to a world leader, make an email, make a phone call, or make a call to help increase awareness of the goal of destroying poverty.
But what success has it achieved when Global Citizen is 12 years left to fulfill its goal?
Is it an original idea to encourage people to do an action through a free concert, or is it just another case of what is called "clicktivism", that is, to make people feel that they are making a real change by signing an online request or sending them a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says he has registered more than 19 million "actions" of his followers, pressing to meet various goals.
He says that world leaders have encouraged these actions to announce policies and commitments of more than $37 billion, and these policies and commitments will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and predictions derived from actions, and at least $10 billion of them have already been paid or received.
The team estimates that guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Among key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, a association of investors and implementers committed to "help children develop their full potential", headquartered in the United Kingdom." He has promised to give Rwanda $35 million in the country to eradicate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donations, national governments and members of Global Cizien like you we will make the social injustice of malnutrition pass into history," said The Power of Nutrition Ullman publicly, at a live concert held in London in April 2018.
In addition, the team has said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced that the Power of Nutrition project would be funded. This project will help 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to this FAQ questions they have on the website, "What makes you think we can make extreme poverty disappear?"
Global Citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements against our previous civil rights and apartheid, we too will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be held at this year's New York event shows. Debrara-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will present the event.
US could use the Army to slow down Russian energy exports as a "block" - Internal Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could use his Army to avoid reaching the markets, including the Middle East, including the United States Secretary Ryan Zinke, has reported by Washington Examiner.
Zinc has stated that Russia's relationship with Syria - as it is evident, where legitimate government is operating what has been demanded - it is only an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think it's the reason they're in the Middle East that they want to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said, according to information.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means of managing it.
"The United States, with our Army, have the ability to ensure that sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinc was talking to participants of an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, i.e. participants of an event organized by a non-profit group that presents himself as a "profit energy voice" in the United States.
Washington compared the approaches to connect with Russia and Iran, making it clear that they are the same after all.
"The economic choice we have in terms of Iran and Russia is approximately taking advantage of fuel and replacing," he said, referring to Russia as an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
Trump's administration has come to promote the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and that is a much cheaper option for European consumers, have come when it has been engaged in a replacement mission.
For this purpose, Trump's administration officials, and US President Donald Trump himself, trying to convince Germany Nord Stream 2 to get out of the gasway project, which makes Berlin Trump's "gativ" in Moscow's words.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 million, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion meters cube, is only an economic project.
Kremlin says that Washington's passionate attitude against the project is simply caused by economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfaithful competition.
"I think we agree that energy can't be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose providers," said Aleksandr Novak Russian energy minister Rick Perry with U.S. energy charter after a meeting in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has had a negative reception from Germany, and has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organization for the German industry, the German Industry Federation, has asked the US not to join the EU's energy policy and the two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will examine" to present as presidential candidate in 2020, said Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts, on Saturday, said he would "examine" to present the presidential candidate after the middle legislative election.
Warren confirmed that while he was in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, he would examine his presentation.
"It's time for women to reach Washington and resolve our broken government, which requires that there be a woman upstairs, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will look deeply at the presentation of the presidential candidate."
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall, "indicating that the country was taking the wrong way."
"I'm absolutely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has spoken clearly in criticizing Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
In any case, a poll published on Thursday has shown that most Warren's electors do not believe he should present a presidential candidate in 2020.
Forty-eight per cent of the "testable" electors in Massachusetts said that the senator should not present a presidential candidate, according to the poll by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Fiven Globe.
Thirty-two per cent were in favor of presenting.
According to the poll, the chances of presenting former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent have protected a possible presentation and 48 per cent have been opposed.
Other names shown in terms of a potential presentation in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide for January, as Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Palin's trauma stress disorder at Donald Trump's election event
Track Palin, a 26-year-old, spent a year after entering Iraq in September.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence Monday night.
"For what my son is suffering from him, who is suffering when he returns, I feel identified with the effects of stress disorder after trauma and other families that suffer from the weaknesses that our soldiers bring back," he told Donald Trump to the public of an election event for Donald Trump, Oklahoma.
Palin said that "a remarkable account" was the arrest, and he said about his son and other veterans of the war, "they return a little changed, they return hard, the other soldiers with members and the members of the air army and the members of the army and all other members of the army come back to ask if there is that respect for what they have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday, in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, with a statement involved in domestic violence and poisoning that he was involved in having a weapon, according to the police voter at Dan Bennett Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. protect the impugnation of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia Distritus are being protected by the law in the US that denies asylum to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims who are fleeing domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and district filed a friendly statement on Friday to support a asylum seeker in Washington, defiing the police, NBC News reported.
It has not been revealed against federal policy the full name of Grace v. Sesssion lawsuits filed by the American Union for Civil Freedoms in August.
He said that his partner "and his violent band members" had caused him sexual abuse, but U.S. officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who create a large number of asylum seekers in the United States because they are countries that have widespread problems with bands and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States revoked a decision made by the Committee of Immigrants, which allowed non-documented immigrants who were fleeing domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said on Friday, "the new police ignores the state, federation and international law of years."
"The federal law states that all asylum requests must be assigned based on particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar violates that principle," the amicus curiae statement reported.
Furthermore, lawyers argued that in the writing the policy that denies the introduction to immigrants is harmed by the US economy, which are more likely to become an activist and offer "the right of work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give more asylum from domestic violence and victims who were fleeing the violence of flags.
"The asylum is available for persecution or fear of being a member of a race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion for those who leave their country," Sesssions said when he presented politics on June 11.
Asiloa has never been to solve all the problems that everyone lives every day, despite serious problems.
Attempts to make a desperate rescue in Palu, while the number of dead has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more serious.
"It feels great," said the 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who had a fever while calming her little son in the destroyed city of Palu.
"The ambulance brings funerals every minute.
Clean water is missing."
They have seen the inhabitants return to their destroyed houses, taking their own things taken by water, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, overflowing.
Some of the wounded, Dwi Haris, for example, with his back and shoulder broken, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital.
Tears fell from his eyes, telling him how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake in the hotel bedroom when he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I crushed against the sand of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was for a marriage in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and his daughter.
I hope they'll be good."
US ambassador accused China of "attacking" with propaganda advertisements
After putting a four-page announcement that encouraged the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China in an ABE newspaper, the US ambassador has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread his propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned the Chinese newspaper at Des Moines Register, the second most selling paper in the state of Iowa, last Wednesday, after accusing China of attempting to enter elections for the United States Congress on November 6. China denies the prosecution.
The fact that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections has marked Trump's what US officials said to Reuters; it was a new campaign in Washington that was rising to pressure China.
Even if it is normal for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a rising trade war. In that war, each country has set the imports of the other.
China's repatial acclaimer, at the beginning of the trade war, had supported Trump's Republican Party planned to attack exports of states like Iowa, China and US experts have stated.
Terry Branstad, China's US ambassador and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, that is, of a state that exports the most agricultural goods to China, has stated that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad has stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now strengthening the attack by putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"He is making use of the campaign, making use of the strong tradition of American free press and press freedom by putting paid advertisements in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the press kiosk here on the street of Beijing itself, there are few dissident voices and you can't see a true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people can have in terms of China's conflicting economic career, because the media depends on the firm control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article," but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans dispel female voters before the legislative election with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn.
As many high-level republicans are waiting and they defend the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that they will have a decline, particularly among women, in the next half legislative elections.
The emotions about this subject have been very large, and most republicans are registered to show that they want to go on with the boot.
In these matters, you can't go back," said Grant Reeher Syracyse Professor of the Maxwell School of the University of Syria in relation to an article published on Saturday to The Hill.
Reeher has said he has doubts whether the pressure that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) could support an FBI investigation will be enough to calm down the voters who are angry.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, and the national spokesman of the progressive group Moveon, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted that "is coming November!" were protesting in front of the Senate that Republicans who control the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, stated in Mick.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be out of place," said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news website.
"People say they've had a great influence; that's true.
But it may still have a greater effect, particularly between women and young people of the suburbs who have no fixed vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that even if they do not like the president, they often give no votes."
Even before public testimony against the Supreme Court candidate Ford explained the details of sexual assault even before public testimony, analysts suggested that there may be a decline if Republicans decided to continue with confirmation.
"It has become a great revolution for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, the former President of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The question is not whether the committee vote, the final vote, or Kavanaugh should sit in the accused's chair, it is also a matter of how Republicans have managed this subject and how they treated the woman," explained the news channel to the news channel the director of the group that the Democratic Guy Cecil "Priorities USA" helps select.
In any case, Americans seem to be quite divided at the time of deciding who they believe in Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, but more people seem to support the second.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of those involved believed in safe or probably Ford's testimony, while 35% probably or probably Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh believed that Kavanaugh probably or probably lied in his statement, and 30% have said the same thing in terms of Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least those made by another accuser, made by Deborah Ramirez, has informed The Guardian.
Last week he declared before the Senate Judicial Committee under oath that Ford attacked Kavanaugh was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez has admitted that the Supreme Court candidates showed him genitals were at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to start a startup aimed at Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's free software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt being "taking the world over".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "her own personal data storage" or POD.
Contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music storage, and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify: they are all available in a single browser, and all at once.
It is distinctive to the personal online data storage that it is entirely up to the user who can access the information of a particular type.
The company calls it "the empowerment of data people."
According to Executive Director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to help put the right resources, processes and capabilities available to all.
Currently these are the ones that make up the company: Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world could create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to ""Facebook and Google about the need to make a complete change when their business models change completely from day to day.
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post published in Medium on Saturday Berners-Lee wrote that "mission is an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed the Internet World Wide Web Consultation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence on network neutrality.
Even at the time of launching the Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next time on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann as the Victoria Cross of the First World War
He has been honored as a warrior of the First World War, the only clergy of the Church of England, who has received the Victoria Cross, in his own country, 100 years later.
Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 during the Bellengliese and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew that he had received the highest British prize in military honor.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandchildren on a parade in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" that the stone was given the prize to his grandfather and display it 100 later.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion by crossing the Channel of Saint-Quentin that "was very closed and under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns."
Then he quickly went to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage until he found a cannon that led the line forward, he threw them alone and three to the ground of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said he knew that his grandfather's actions "would never do them, but that makes him feel great humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a flower crown after the parade. The parade was led by the Imperial Youth Band of Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero proves the protection that many people will give him."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig were placed instead.
Suppose you wake up all night to see Bellator 206 full of people, and then they won't let you see the main session.
The sign of San Jose had 13 fights, between six main calendar, and was scheduled to be delivered directly at night in the United Kingdom, Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the United Kingdom's audience was shocked when the coverage was moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after being awake until the small hours of the morning specifically for battle.
A follower described it as a "bad bad joke" to Twitter's change in cartoons for children."
"A government law states that this content was not appropriate by 6:00 a.m., and they had to change their children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, the chief vice president of Bellator's marketing and communication, when asked about the performance.
""Pappa Pig, "yes".
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they will examine programming to consider audiences in the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can probably fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning, and we can't fix that until it's Sunday in our hour, Monday at their time.
But we're working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going forward and forth, and not all were very pleasant.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise that next time it won't happen again.
We're going to put in five fights instead of put six in the way we usually do, we tried to offer people more, and we messed up.
Unfortunately, it's a situation that happens."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'Recited' in respect of sex
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up by feeling underestimated compared to others for sex, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said that until he went to secondary school he did not realize that "they were not all like him."
When speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he spoke to others to "think" about gay rights.
In addition, he said that being a parent led to less importance to winning Olympic games.
The usual presenter of the program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of vacation for the disease.
After appearing completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "recited" compared to everyone else because society didn't allow boys and girls to like them."
He said, "The feelings that make you feel despised and different from others have been the real reasons that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" in his own words because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they heard of his sexuality.
The sportsman who has won two bronze medals in Olympic games has become a high profile LGBT promoter, and used the participation of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had given his opinion that he felt he was very lucky without suffering any consequences that he could live in an open way and wanted to give others a " expectancy".
Three times the world champion said that he had fallen in love with a man - American filmmaker David Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - had " caught her with surprise".
Daley married the winner of the kicker 20 years older than himself last year, but said age inequality has not been a problem among them.
He said that "when you're so young and so many things happen to you" - at the age of 14, he went to Olympic games for the first time and his father died with cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone of the same age who has passed similar incidents.
The couple became the parent of his son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley has said that his "full vision" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, 'I have to win a gold medal' was the only thing I had in mind," he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than the gold medals in Olympic games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 after diagnosis of mental cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that they had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't say, "You won't be in a position to be on the front line, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and until he stopped breathing and I did not admit that he was not invincible," he said.
The next day Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics, and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I dreamed all my life: to stand in front of the local public in Olympic games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song choice -Proud, Heather Small, who made him feel identified throughout the process of preparing for the Olympic game and still puts a chicken ass on his ass.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was not in shape, stayed in the chair on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his form to avoid looking bad.
Mickelson was breaking the mark for two years playing 12 times in the event; however, Captain Jim Furyk sent him to the chair in Saturday's fourball and heartsome modalities.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five-time champion who has been a champion split the day on one side of being animator and on the other side of working on the field, hoping to direct what makes him suffer.
He was never the most direct of the drivers, not even at the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best option for the competitive dynamic of Le Golf National, who are dominated by the toughest players who are lost.
And though the field itself doesn't scare him enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game, on Sunday, will have to face Francesco Molina's British Open champion, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win this week's four games.
If the Americans start 12 individual games below four points, have a good start, it could be a crucial game of Mickelson.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, because he couldn't say much more.
"He understood the role he had today, he gave me a little blow on my back, and he told me tomorrow he would be ready," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a leading sportsman and has given these teams tremendously in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see two games playing.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we felt like we had to act that way.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record as players playing the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the end of the professional Ryder Cup career that has not reached its individual brand again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and has stopped seven times. However, according to Furyk, he has brought something intangible to the team.
"It makes him laugh, and he's sarcastic and intelligent, he's usually joking with people, and it's extraordinary to have his presence," he said.
"Young players enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to see it.
He does a lot more than play."
Thomas Bjorn's captain of the European team knows that the great advantage they have can disappear immediately.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows experienced that despite the great advantage in the last day's individual shift, the Ryder Cup tournament can become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, the Danish debut was held in Valderraman, where his team had a five-point advantage under Seve Ballesteros against the Americans, but they won the tournament closely with a score of 141 -2 and 132.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a great advantage in Valderraman and barely won, and that we lost it in Brooklin even though it was a great advantage," said Bjorn (on photo), 2018 after winning 5 and 3 on Friday and yesterday, having gained an advantage of 10 and 6 on Le Golf National Field.
So history tells us both me and all the team members that this is not over yet.
We'll be careful tomorrow.
We'll go out to the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing has been decided until the points are on the clipboard.
We aim to win the trophy, and we will focus on it.
As I always said, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the opposite side: the best players in the world."
Happy with the achievements his players have made on a difficult golf course, Bjorn also said, "I never want to advance anything.
Tomorrow tomorrow.
It's individual's turn tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, each golf player must prove their full ability.
This is the message you need to convey to players: get the best you have tomorrow.
Now forget your comrades, because they must get their best out."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team will play better than his players individually as a member, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Fury himself has been in the same way on both sides of these last day directional changes, as a member of the Brookline winning team, and later lost against the European team when Europeans did the "Medina miracle".
"I remember all the words I said," he said, when we asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the beginning, like Brooklin and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We have decided on that list of players, and we are hoping to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has a job to counterattack, and Rory McIlroy will have an opponent in the last match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top middle order.
"I chose that group in that order because they are in a position to go the whole way," Bjorn said about the individuals selected.
The construction of the new German battleship has been postponed again.
The new German marina frigate was required in 2014 to replace old battleships during the Cold War period, but it will not be built until at least next year, due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media says.
The request for the battleship called "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the main ship of new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit mentioned a military spokesman.
The ship had to enter the marnan in 2014, but eleven problems after delivery have prevented this ambitious project from being able to complete this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships requested in 2007 will replace old Bremen class frigates.
It seems to have a powerful cannon, the technology for carrying out features and hidden actions against aircraft and ship missiles (e.g., reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have longer maintenance capabilities: the newest frigates may be outside the original ports for up to two years.
However, due to constant delays, these battleships with cutting-edge technology (who aim to project their own power) will become obsolete by the time they enter the service, says the Die Zeit newspaper.
The F125 frigate that has ended badly made a lot of noise in your own media last year, as the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the marina had returned a ship to the shipyard after he had delivered it.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned serious "software and hardware defects"; as a result, the warship would be unusable if they were used in combat missions.
Software errors were particularly important, Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by 120 sailors, i.e. half of them in Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship has too much weight and as a result its performance is greatly reduced, and it is harder to add innovations to marina in the future.
The 7,000 tons of "Sheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice the similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project (including stimulation training) is also a problem.
It is said to have reached €3,100 million from €2,200 that should cost them at first.
The problems with new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that the German marine power is being reduced.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the "available ships of marina are running out".
The representative has said that the problem has increased more and more because no replacement has been given after the withdrawal of the old ships.
He also regretted that a Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate had not entered the marina.
The secret life of the bat has been observed by the National Trust
A new study has been conducted on a land on the Scottish mountain area to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food.
They are expected to get more information about the behavior of these special flying mammals so that they can better determine their protection activities in the future.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust (NTS) of Scotland will track common dwarf bats and sopranos, as well as that of high ear and Daubenton bats, in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in essential locations, and the activities that bats will perform throughout the season will be tracked.
The UK health system (NHS) workers will also carry out mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts perform sound analysis of all recorders, the frequency of bat calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then the habitat map and report will be made to obtain a detailed landscape scale image of bat behavior.
Rob Deware, a natural protection consultant at NTS, believes that the most important areas of bat habitat will be determined, as well as how each species uses them.
This information allows the advantages of the work to treat habitat, for example, the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat population of Scotland as well as throughout the United Kingdom significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects nests and lose habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also pose a risk, as well as fly capture papers, chemical treatments in construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, as they usually hunt at night, their ears are more useful to them than their eyes, at the moment of acquiring prey.
They use a sophisticated echo positioning technique to see bugs and obstacles on the flight road.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of Scotland, and takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly conduct observations, nest examinations, and sometimes rescues.
In fact, the organization has created the first and unique bat reserve in Scotland on the Dumfries and Threave land in Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, who is the land manager, says the land is perfect for them.
"We have a great field for Threeven bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, and trees for many years; habitat is very suitable.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so that thanks to our work here and on other lands, we will understand what they need for them to be healthy."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check that there is bats before maintenance in the onibars, for if only one maternity nest is destroyed, 400 female bats and young can die, and perhaps so the entire local population could disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, pursue them, or to disturb them, as well as to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representing the Sazar protection organization, has asked the general population for help.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while his lawyers rush to denounce the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the acts of rape against him are "false news", and that those who have done it only want to "get publicity" using his name.
His lawyer is preparing to denounce the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published the complaint.
The forerunner of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in Las Vegas.
After that, he allegedly paid $375,000 in exchange for keeping the event secret, Der Spiegel stated on Friday.
A few hours after the prosecution was released, he has made a live Instagram video for 142 million followers on the platform Ronaldo, who is 33 years old, where he said that the allegations are "false news".
"No, no, no, no.
What I said today is fake news," said footballer who won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
"They want to get publicity using my name.
It's normal.
They want to achieve fame by my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which are said to be "an unacceptable publication on suspicions that affect privacy".
Christian Schretz has said that the player will ask for compensation "as far as it concerns the severity of the break, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event took place in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the player's bedroom, where she allegedly raped her from the uru, documents from the Clark County district court in Nevada say.
Mayora has stated that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident, and said he was a "good man in 99 per cent", but that he failed "one hundred."
Documents say Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but the relationship was allowed.
Mayora has also said he went to the police, and took pictures of his wounds in the hospital, but later reached an agreement outside the court because "represalis scared him terribly", and "because he was worried about being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old woman said she wants to withdraw the agreement because of the alleged event that she remains traumatized.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he went to the large Italian Juve team due to a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK "will regret it forever" to lose self-fabrillers
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" to be head of car manufacturers after "Brexit", the business sector Greg Clark said.
He also said that Toyota UK has said to the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement will stop its factory production in Burnston (about Drby).
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
Japan's car manufacturer has said that delays in customs due to an agreement without agreement could lead to a loss of jobs.
The Burnston factory (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union countries.
"We believe that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, our factory production will stop," said the Toyota director Marvin Cook Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also stated that they are afraid that they do not know how trade between borders will work if they leave the European Union without agreement.
BMW, for example, has said that after the "Brexit" he will close his Mini factory for a month.
The main concern for car manufacturers is the risks around the supply chain if the "Brexit" is carried out without agreement.
Toyota's production line is "current" and the pieces arrive every 37 minutes, both from the United Kingdom and European Union providers for the cars generated as requested.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement on 29 March, interruptions could occur at borders and consequently delays and privations of pieces.
It would not be possible for Toyota to store an inventory of more than one day in the Derbyshire factory, as a result, production should be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations of the European Union is "specifically measured to avoid these customs studies."
"It's necessary to have an agreement, we want the best deal, not only to ensure the current success, but also to make use of this opportunity in the future," he said on BBC Radio 4.
"In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have shown that it is essential to continue the supply chains that are very successful."
Toyota could not indicate how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it has warned that, due to additional costs, the competitiveness of the factory would be reduced and consequently jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsuovalris, who has worked in Burnaston's 24 years and coordinator of the Unite's factory, said that the members are getting more and more concerned: "I'm sorry to say that if we lose these jobs, we won't get them back.
A government spokesman has said, "We have presented a detailed and convincing future contact plan to the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House.
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein could be "another week behind", while the conflict about the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh has said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special advisor Robert Mueller.The influence of Russia in the US elections, the connection between Trump's assistants and Russia, and Mueller is investigating the alleged justice behind the president.
Trump has fired the general prosecutor and consequently risked Muelle's independence in Washington for the last few months.
Previously this month, the New York Times has reported that Rosenstein considered taking a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as to remove the president from the post in accordance with Article 25 of the US constitution.
Rosenstein has cancelled the information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House while the information said he would resign.
Instead, he stated that he would have a meeting with Trump at the United Nations headquarters in New York at Thursday.
Trump has said he prefers not to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting has been delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate judicial power committee; in that committee, one of the women accused Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexually assaulting him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, was tested.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, which has been further delayed by the Senate vote.
Trump's press secreter appeared on Sunday at Sarah Sanders Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "No date has yet been set; it may be this week, but I would understand to delay in another week, considering everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We'll see, though; I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will not agree with this statement: in fact Sanders has not issued a White House press conference since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked him that reason.
Sanders said there was no lack of press conferences that television journalists are "greater", but he said, "I agree they're big."
He then suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes much more attempts than his predecessors," he said, and added without mentioning the evidence: "We have verified these statistics."
Sanders said they will continue to do press conferences, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is much better than asking me.
We try to do that many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times in the last few weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we allow us to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, participates in open sessions, or during press conferences when visiting the dignaries.
He doesn't usually do his own press conferences.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the President of the United States in New York this week, when he made a spontaneous and sometimes strange appearance in the face of journalists gathered there.
The UK's healthcare department has written a letter to European Union workers working on the NHS system in Scotland for concerns about "Brexit".
The health department has written to European Union workers working on the NHS health system in Scotland to thank them for the entire country, and to ask them to stop after "Brexit".
The letter is written by the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman less than six months to leave the European Union.
The Scottish government has already agreed to take over the cost of requests by the citizens of the European Union who work in public services ("setled status").
Freeman said in his letter: "In the summer, negotiations on Brexit have progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and is expected to make a decision for autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has increased preparations for a possible non-treatment exit.
I know it's a very disturbing time for you all.
That is why I want to confirm that I take very seriously the contribution of each worker, whatever his nationality.
European union colleagues, as well as those outside, bring useful experiences and abilities, and improve the work of health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without a doubt, and we hope to live with us."
Christion Abercrombie has been operated in an emergency after suffering a wound in the head.
Christion Abercrombie has been operated in emergency after having suffered a wound in the head after losing 31 and 27 on Saturday against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ in Tenness has reported.
Rod Reed Tennessee State's main coach said the player has suffered a mental wound slightly before the middle rest of the game.
"He's been watered and fainted," Reed said.
Coaches and medical persons have given oxygen in the band itself, and took it on a litter for a deeper medical examination.
A representative of Tennessee State has told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, has left the operation and is at the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris said, "They haven't given any details about the type of wound or his anxiety," and they are trying to determine when the wound occurred in Tennessee State.
He is in his second year with red-shirts Abercrombie, and has its first season after transferring to Tennessee State from Illinois.
He made five badges before leaving the game on Saturday, having made a total of 18 badges throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay greater tax on timbre when they buy honests in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on timbre when they buy on the onybars in the United Kingdom, and this additional amount will be used to help those who have been left homeless, following the plans of the conservative party.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success of attracting young voters
For those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, there will be a increase in the tax on tibre.
The Public Treasure believes that they will gather £120 million per year to help homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on timbre when they buy honests in the United Kingdom, and how much additional will be used to help those left homeless, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success of attracting young voters; Corbyn has promised to provide housing with reasonable prices and pay more taxes to those with the most income.
In the United Kingdom, the increase in tax on timbre will be for people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional amount collected will be used for efforts to reduce people sleeping on the street.
Overload, which is an addition to the tax on the current tib (including higher taxes for the second houses entered and rent two years ago), can reach up to three per cent.
The Public Treasure believes that they will collect £120 million per year.
13 per cent of the onibars built in London are estimated to be purchased by those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as a result, prices rise and it is harder to enter the housing market for those who want to buy for the first time.
The rich areas of the country, especially of the capital, have become "mam peoples", for foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the city.
In order to help young people buy their first home, Boris Johnson comes after a request to reduce tax on timbre, this new policy.
He has charged large construction companies to keep the prices of the onibar without buying and using land, and has asked May to abandon the reasonable price fee for housing in order to resolve the "house life crisis" in Britain."
Corbyn has, in turn, presented some attractive reforms about housing, including rental control and "unreasoning" housing.
In addition, it wants to give the municipalities more power to build more housing.
May said, "I said last year I would devote my presidency to restore the British dream to improve the life of each new generation.
That means repairing the rotten housing market.
Britain's doors will always be open for those who want to live, work and organize their lives.
However, to be as easy as for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for British people who work hard for foreign companies, it is not fair.
For too many people, the dream of possessing a home has gone too far, and the dignity of those who have to sleep on the street are still here."
Jack Ross: "Being a coach of Scotland's team is my greatest wish"
Jack Ross Sunderland leader says his "greatest parent" sometime coaching the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, in third place in League One, from first place to three points.
This summer he came to the Stadium of Light, after St Mir's return to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to act as a player for my country.
I won a trophy in the B League, and that was all," Ross said in the BBC Scotland Sportsound program.
"But I watched Scottish games from childhood with my father in Hampden, and I have always had the desire to return.
However, I would only have the opportunity if I had the ability to handle the club."
Among those of Sunderland's former coaches before Ross, there are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss has said he felt no nervousness for coming after such great names, for Barnsley and Ipswich Town had previously refused to offer training.
"To measure the success, I'm going to have to ask myself, "Can I return the club to the Premier League?"
Given the club's structure and facilities, it should certainly be in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful if I can't do that."
Ross has been as a coach for only three years, as a assistant to Dumbarton's boss at a time and one of Hearts' training workers after 15 months.
He then helped Allola to recover after he got down to the third level, and even thanks to him, he became a champion from being on the verge of getting off St Mir's rank the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was perhaps a real crossroads for me," he said about taking charge of Allo.
"I really thought being a coach was the best function for me than being a player.
That's funny to say, because I was a good player, I was a good life, and I lived some important moments of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the work, but I'm happy as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that's what I'm doing, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever before."
The full interview will be held on September 30 (Sunday) at Radio Scotland Radio Scotland during 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
Five and a half of Saturday is the best time to have a drink, according to a poll.
Thanks to the summer heatball, Britain's income has risen greatly, but pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
Sales of pub and bar chains have risen 2.7 per cent, but the restaurant has dropped 4.8 per cent, data says.
Peter Martin, who works in the CGA business advice that has collected the data, says: "As the sun has steadily hit, and as England's team has remained more than expected in the World Football Championships, July data is similar to June, where pub revenue has risen 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants have dropped even more.
Although the sales of the restaurants have dropped 1.8, they have been even worse in July.
pubs and bars that specialize in drinks have had much better performance, and their rise has been greater than the decrease in restaurant sales.
The pubs that specialize in food have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want to have a drink.
Pub and bars drink sales have risen by 6.6% per cent in the past month, and food has dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, who is a leisure and host analyst at RSM, has said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and social events are the most important factors in terms of trade sales outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains have financial embarrassments, and having a decrease of 4.8 per cent of sales from year to year will result in important damage, in addition to following pressures around the cost.
The long and hot air comes in an extreme time for establishments that specialize in food, and it is to be seen if the moderate temperatures in August will give them any relief."
The rise of sales of pubs and restaurants, including that of newly opened establishments, has been 2.7 per cent in July, where the expansion of the chains has slowed down.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index oversees sector sales in terms of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, collected and analysed performance data from 47 operator groups. These operators have incomes with more than £9,000 million. This index is considered a reference point in the sector.
One in five children have accounts that one hides from their parents on social networks
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts that hide from parents and teachers on social networks, according to a poll.
In a survey of 20,000 students from secondary school, it was possible to see that "false Instagram accounts" have risen.
Because of this news, the fear that sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account that parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts that they hide from adults on social networks.
In a survey of 20,000 students from secondary school, it has been possible to see that many "false Instagram accounts" have been uploaded ( Instagram is a photo sharing website).
Because of this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty per cent of the students say they have a clear "primary" account that parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website, where one teenager used to call others "Free me."
This study by Digital Awareness UK and the "Directors Conference" (HMC) of independent schools has explained that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 years old have two profiles, from which half acknowledge that they have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan's head said, "It's a shame that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "speaker of athletes" at the Scottish athletics committee
He has been appointed ex-executative director of the Scottish athletics committee Eilidh Doyle, this year's general assembly of the administrative council.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized athlete, and director Ian Beattie has said that with this change they have an excellent opportunity for those who lead sport to make use of his extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect for the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world, and we know that it will be very useful for Scottish athletics to be on board," Beatti said.
Doyle has said, "I love being a consultant for athletes, and I hope I will make a big contribution, and lead the sport in Scotland."

It was very hard, but I've been completely restored, I had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages you sent me!"
An advertisement from someone who compares their mother to cows has created contrary opinions on the Internet.
A milk-out company has created opposing opinions on the Internet compared to cows that the breast donors were milked.
To make a presentation of what is said to be the world's first silent milk extraction laptop, Elvie has released a joke advertisement inspired by a music video inspired by a music video to show the freedom that the new device gives to mothers who extract milk.
Four women who are really mothers dance in a stable full of straw, with these words and a song that has the same: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't stick," and "Maybe you didn't notice, but these are not brooms, but my tits."
The motto is "Get out of milk, take out milk, give milk to the little ones, take out milk, get out of milk, I'm milking my girls."
However, this advertisement, which the company has posted on Facebook's page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has produced a variety of reactions in the audience, many have said that it does not take seriously the "horriousness" of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to create milk, but their young are stolen a few days after birth," said a user.
Elvie milk extraction can be introduced discreetly in one of the breasts of breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Very traumatic, of course, for mother and baby.
But, well, why not use children to advertise a milk-out for mothers that they don't take them?"
Someone else added, "This advertisement has no kindness."
Others, however, have defended the advertisement, who has acknowledged that a woman has thought her "a sort of bursting with laughter."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still had a chest, I'd buy one.
When I took out milk I felt like I was a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but that's his goal.
It's a great product," a user wrote.
Another has commented: "It's a fun laugh, directed to mothers who extract milk (they often have to do it in workplaces or in common), because they feel as if they were "bees."
He has no intention of praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have been dancing with milk-steading on their breast.
Many women who extract milk are considered to feel like cows in the campaign.
But Elvie milk-ate is completely silent, and has no cable or spat. One of the breasts can be carried discreetly, so that women can move as they wish, keep the babies in their arms, or be able to get out of the street.
An Ana Balarin Mother's partner and executive director has commented: "Elvie milk harvesting is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and challenging presentation.
With this similarity between women and milk cows that draw milk, we wanted to highlight the process of milking and all its challenges, and also express the freedom of milk-to-doing in an entertaining and near way.
This is not the first time Elvie milking has attracted attention.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the pass for designer Marta Yakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been taken in silence to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children in the back has increased greatly recently, although it is approximately the same monthly surveillance on the border, one of the reasons for Trump's administrator is because of the rhetoric and harsh guidelines of Trump's administrator, because it has been harder to bring children to sponsors.
So far, most of the sponsors have been paperless immigrants themselves, but now they are afraid to register to protect children, as they could lose their power to stop in the US.
The risk increased in June, since federal authorities said that those who wanted to be sponsors and other adults living in their home would have to send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albenc, one of the U.S. immigration and customs security officers, acknowledged that dozens of people who had requested to protect the minors who had arrived without adults had been arrested.
This agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of them had no criminal precedent.
" Nearly 80 per cent of the sponsors or those who live with them are illegal in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still grasping them," said Albenc.
In order to process the child's situation faster, officers have created new rules, according to them, they must appear in court within a month after the children have been captured, and not as before in 60 days, in the words of the shelter workers.
Many of them will appear in a video conference call to request legal status from a immigration court.
If it is decided that they are not suitable for receiving help, they will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in care centers, the more there is the opportunity to increase their anxiety and depression, which may result in violent anger or attempts to escape, depending on reports on the system in recent months.
Children's defenders say that these concerns increase in large facilities such as Tornillo, for as it is so great, there is more probability of ignoring children's problems.
They have also said that if children are taken to the camp camp without time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends, the trauma they already have can increase.
Syria urges the "occupant forces" in the United States, France and Turkey to be removed immediately
In the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign minister Walid al-Moualem has also called for its return home to Syrian refugees, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moulem, who is also the replacement of the Prime Minister, has said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated "as they may be treated."
"They must be immediately and unconditionally out of the country," he said on the committee.
Moulem has said that the war against Syria is almost over; 3600,000 people have died in that war since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus has said that "to continue to fight in the sacred battalion" "until we clean all Syria territories" and from terrorist groups, both "legal foreign presence".
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the land of the country that has been destroyed by the war.
As for the subject of refugees, Moulem has said that there are appropriate conditions to return them, and he has attributed to some "west countries" of spreading the "Irrational fear" that encourages refugees to stop outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian institutions to enable these returns," he said.
"They're politicized what's only humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Russia and Turkey have recently made an agreement to create a shelter area in the last fortress of rebels in Idlib; the United Nations diplomats believe that it is possible to promote political dialogue thanks to it.
Russia's aided Syrian forces avoided a large-scale attack between Russia and Turkey in that province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moulem has said that the agreement has clear "limits" agreements, and has stated that military action will aim for jihadists, including the Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaeda, which will be "decuted".
The United Nations courier Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of the new assembly will be held among members of the government and opposition to begin to form a constitution after the war, as well as to begin to expand the way for elections.
Moualem has established certain conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this assembly, saying that the work of the assembly must be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why Trump will win for the second time
Following this logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless a process of detention or scandals (possibly as expected) does not end his presidency before it needs.
That would be the most dramatic end of a prisoner!"
For now, the audience doesn't seem tired.
As of 2014, the audience at CNN at the majority-hour audience has almost doubled until the acquisition of 1.05 million viewers, and tripled the MSNBC chain until 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers on that schedule, which has risen 1.7 million years ago, according to Nielsen's data.The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC network has the largest cable television viewer, and has achieved up to 3.5 million viewers on the nights where important news has occurred.

Scovell asked the reason.
"Because he was supposed to make him laugh," said Scovell.
There is also time for entertainment in chaos.
Of course, like nothing else on television, stories coming from Washington the future of abortion law, immigrants' families can meet again, and decide the health of the world-class economy.
Only high privilege audiences have the opportunity to disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching a debate of experts on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward has used "depth savings" to write the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000 ostrich skin jacket ("a garment full of debris" in The Washington Post), and the funny way Stormy Daniels describe Trump's "anatomy".
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, founder of Wheelhouse Entertainment's executive director and "Pawn Stars" show, says this to the changing characters and arguments of Trump's show (to argue with the national football league, praise Kim Jong-un): "'Reality show', because it gives you something to consume every day."

He could not descend from television, particularly now that Brett Kavanaugh must appear before the board of judicial power of the Senate, and that the future of the Supreme Court is hanging.
"When I used to do those funny TV shows, people would say it was the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

External money is entering the bar in the most equal elections in the United States Congress's half-final elections.
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania money is entering the bar, because Congressed disorders have been reorganized, and as a result, two headlines are competing to get the same chair.
The boundaries have recently been reorganized in this district around Pittsburg, the Democratic Party Conor Lamb, who won his chair in special elections in another district.
Another headline is the enemy Lamb, who represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly overlapping with the 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated against what the constitution says for Republicans. As a result of this verdict, the boundaries of maps were properly delined.
This competition of the new district has caused a close competition for campaigns funding on the main party funding sources: the congress committee of the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the national commission of the Republican campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania for little while he won the 18th Congressist elections in Pennsylvania in March.
The chair belonged to a Republican in the last decade, and President Donald Trump also won the distance with a 20-point advantage.
In the words of political statements, Democrats have a little advantage.
The US has considered to punish El Salvador for its support for China, but then rejects the decision
Diplomacyrs have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, that Washington has hardly asked them to retreat.
Trump had a polite meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to overthrow Trump's management team.
The state department's officers decided to take out of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, following "new decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", as Heather Nauert said in an early month statement.
However, penalties were considered only against El Salvador, which received $140 million as support from the United States in 2017, including to control drug trafficking, promote development and help the economy.
Among the proposed penalties there are restrictions and specific visa restrictions that would be very harmful to the country of Central America due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officers delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which aimed to be a successor to a similar meeting in the previous year, and was considered progress in their efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid September, the senior administrative officers made it clear that they wanted to take the conference, and thus announced that the consideration of establishing penalties on El Salvador was abandoned.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to participate in the conference that has changed in mid October, a sign of the importance of administrator to the meeting, according to diplomats.
Three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or penalties in Washinton.
Bolton's White House spokesman has denied making a statement about the details given by three American officers about the discussion. Among the officers were two diplomats who have agreed to report internal discussions in exchange for preserving anonymity.
An analyst who has a close relationship with administration and has also spoken anonymously has confirmed what they said.
Learn History
Fiscal Robert Mueller's report will soon be released, which will indicate whether Trump had interfered with justice, because there is much evidence of this in public point of view.
In addition, Mueller is also investigating whether Russia had been accompanied by Trump's campaign in the U.S. elections.
If the majority of Congress changes in parties, Trump will have to give him instructions, while he is prepared to appear again in front of the voters (and, if necessary, a jury of his equals).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I don't mean Trump's inevitable decline del, nor Trump's European equivalent.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and it will determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, if Western countries had supported it and accompanied the Czechs of Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of years after that.
History is full of such inflection points that cause us to accelerate or delay the accidental progress of democracy.
Americans are currently facing a number of such inflection points.
What are we going to do if Trump releases the general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, who controls what will happen with Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been in danger since this newspaper announced last year that he suggested recording the president secretly, and stated that the president was inappropriate to his office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times has stated is incorrect.
"How can we respond if the investigation that has just been asked for about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he receives confirmation to be a judge of the Supreme Court, even if credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony have been made against him?
And above all, will we vote in a Congress that will demand responsibility for Trump in the mid-regional elections?
If we don't pass those tests, it's going to be a red winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans in Rangers feels optimistic about the competition against Rapid Vienna
Rapid Vienna will be the host of Rangers on Thursday. They know that if the Austrians defeat, after the exciting draw with the Spanish Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will stay in a perfect position to qualify the G team in the Europa League.
Because of a half injury experienced by Graham Dorrans on his knee, he was unable to make his first appearance of the season until a draw of 2 and 2 with Villarreals, but believes Rangers can use this as a tram for better things.
"It was a good result, because it's a good opponent Villarreal ," said the 31-year-old player.
"We were trying to get something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have had an opportunity to win at the end, but the draw is a fair result, if necessary.
In the first half they prevailed and in the second we were the masters.
Thursday night will be very important for the European championship.
We hope to score three points, but it's going to be difficult, because they had a good result in the last game, however, the audience is on our side, and I hope we'll get a positive result.
Last year was difficult; I had injuries and changes were made in the club itself, but there is a positive atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it a lot; training is also good.
I hope we will move forward, forget about the previous season and succeed."
Women are deeply concerned about a problem related to their retirement savings.
The participants in the poll knew what care they want to have, but very few have reported to their family members.
Half of those involved in Nationwide's research said he has spoken to his partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 per cent has spoken about it with his children.
"We want some family member to wait for us, but we don't dare to ask," explained Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance company.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: the family won't be willing to take care of you if you don't ask him first.
Aritu collaborates with an advisor and to agree where and how you want to receive care with your family, because these opportunities will depend on the cost of care.
Ask a consultant for help: a consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term surveillance, including the usual long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay the expenses of care in cash and insurance that can pay for each one with their money at the moment, provided you have that money.
Clear legal documents: forget legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health care; in the same way, make sure you will be taken care of as you wish if you are not able to request it by professionals.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial opportunities on your behalf and, when you are unable to do so, make sure you pay bills.
Don't forget the details: suppose parents are old and one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Write these details to be prepared in a written plan.
"The bills are at stake, but what are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died on Friday due to the earthquake and tsunami that the Indonesian city of Palu suffered, and agents say the number of dead will increase.
Since communication systems are cut, aid agents have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the area closest to the epicenter of magnitude 7.5 magnitude, north of Palu.
Palun, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here is an important information about the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi and the Donggala government:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that occupies more than 300 km (180 miles) that make up the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi Province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but Morowalin is mostly concentrated on the coast across Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian table for disaster management (Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management), Paluk and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died, and hundreds of homes were destroyed as a result of a tsunami in Donggalan.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred in the west of Donggal, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the "Pacific fire belt", which is why it often supports earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake occurred on the west coast of Aceh in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami. This tsunami shook 14 countries, and 226,000 deaths throughout the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred in southern Java (the island with the largest population in Indonesia), and caused a tsunami. This tsunami severely shook the southern coast, and nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of Sumatra Province in the south.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, and caused a maximum tsunami of 10 meters, which resulted in dozens of villages destroyed, and about 300 people died.
2016: A small earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya government in Aceh, and brought about disaster and fear, as people remembered the destruction of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred at the time, but more than 100 people died crushed by buildings.
2018: There were several major earthquakes among tourists on the Lombok island of Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, particularly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists who were temporarily unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested with domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former governor and vice president of Alaska, has been arrested with assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old and born in Wasillan (Alaska), was arrested for suspecting a domestic violence case, obstructing a domestic violence case and against authority, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers division.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman began calling the police to denounce the alleged crime, Palin removed her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility Center in Preventive prisoner and a bail of $500.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, and said that when he was a allegated, he said he was "undue, innocent," as the net reported.
Palin has been charged with three light A-level crimes, and could be sentenced to a maximum of one year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a light B-level crime, likely to be punished with a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was accused of attacking him.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, home attacks were accused of obstructing the accusation of a domestic violence crime and having a weapon being drunk.
The girlfriend stated that she gave her a muzzle.
When her son's aggressive attitude was associated with the disorder of post-traumatic stress caused by the experience of Iraq, Sarah Palin received severe criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died on Friday after an earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake created a tsunami, and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks are suspended, and the number of dead in the coming days is expected to rise.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, which is in the northeast of Jakatta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are a lot of videos that show the moment of impact on social networks.
In fact, due to a beach festival in Palu City, there were hundreds of people there when the tsunami shook the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants a special death penalty for the suspect of the New York terrorist attack
The federal prosecutor in New York wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saippov, suspected of terrorist attack in New York City; the last time such a sentence was imposed for a federal crime in the state in 1953.
It was believed that 30-year-old Saipov used a rental truck at Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway Avenue in South Manhattan; during this October attack, he had previously carried all footmen and bicycles.
To reason for the death sentence, the prosecutor must prove that Saipov killed these eight people "wanted" and had seriously injured several people, according to the intentional notice of the death penalty presented in the South District in New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible in both cases to impose a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury charged Saipov 22 cases, including eight charges of murder for organized crime, which is commonly used by federal taxation in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction by motor vehicle.
The prosecutor said the attack that "presumed and planned" was to be "in advance and planned", as Saipov had "cruly"; he described it.
"Sayfullo Habibullavievic's actions caused wounds, damage and losses to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darre Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendozza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intent note.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time the South District of New York sued a case of death.
The accused Khalid Barnes was subsequently charged with the murder of two drug providers, but eventually, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York in 1953. It was then established to Julius and Ethhel Rosenberg, which were accused of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbekistan Saipov did not show a halt in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he didn't feel bad about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that the inspiration to attack on the mobile device had been seen by the ISIS organization videos.
He also asked that in the police words, he would put the flag of ISIS in the hospital room.
22 As for the accusation of crime, he has declared himself innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for replacing Saipov, said they have "great disappointment" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that instead of accepting the declaration of guilt for the death penalty for an opportunity to release, the decision to demand the death penalty will only prolong trauma to people who have suffered the impact of these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to ask for death sentences before.
A Conservative Party parliamentary member says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of the negotiations around Brexit
Nigel Farage has ordered "mobilizing the people's army" today in protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP party leader has said that politicians need to feel the "hot" of Eurosceptics, and Theresa May's parliamentarians have proposed it to take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative parliamentarian Peter Bone has explained to the Birmingham march participants, if Mr. Farage was already the secretary of Brexit.
But conservatives in favour of staying have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, and highlighted the challenge of Mrs. May before her: to reconcile the completely distributed queues again.
The Prime Minister Chequers is trying to keep the commitment plan going, but in between supporters of Brexit, supporters of staying, and the EU attacks.
The Allies believe that it will continue and try to reach an agreement with Brussels apart from such reactions, and force Eurosceptics and farmers to decide between its offer or "caos".
As Mr. Bone explained to the participants in the demonstration of the Leave Means Leave, which was held in Solihull, he wants to release "Chequers".
He also stated that he had to collaborate with Mr. Farage and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was careful, we'd be out already," he said.
The Welsh Party parliamentarian added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must fire Chequers."
Indicating opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight in world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws, in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "It is a lie that the British have changed their ideas and want to stay."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and supporters of Brexit, also went to the march, and explained to the correspondents, "I have only this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers are not known among the people, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not known among our party members, nor among our activists who shake the streets and make it possible to win elections.
Put Chequers aside and start listening."
By addressing Mrs. May, he added: "The Prime Ministers, to continue to have work, must keep their word.
Mr. Farage told those who participated in the demonstration, politicians must be forced to "to feel the heat" if they go to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between our (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today so they can't let them know "we won't let them out with theirs."
Conducting to the public full of enthusiasm, he added: "I want you to feel the heat to our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of citizens who gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud."
Meanwhile, the stay supporters walked through Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A few activists raised signs against Brexit after this weekend's team lunch.
Adonis lord, a husband member, laughed at the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can function properly, and in Ireland the whole technology of Canada plus plus chain, of non-facing limits, of free unlimited trade."
"It's a big lie.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren will examine the possibility of "with great care" to be a presidential candidate.
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will examine the possibility of "with great care" to be a presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe has reported that the Democrat of Massachusetts spoke at the plenary meeting that was formed in the western Town Hall of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will be nominated again in November against the Republican Party's state representative Geoff Diehl; he was Vice President of the Massachusetts campaign in Diehl Trump in 2016.
It is said that Trump may take place in 2020.

One participant asked him if he intended to be president.
Warren replied that it was time to "the woman to settle our broken government to go to Washington, and for that, a woman must be in power."
A suspect has been arrested for shooting that caused Sims' death at the University of Louisiana.
Police in Baton Rouge, Luisiana, announced on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect for the shooting that caused the death of basketball player Wayde Sims at the University of Louisiana.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson's arrest at 11:00 (East Time).
Before that, he opened the video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in it.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed on Friday morning near the southern university campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, and as a result he finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul explained to the newspaper Saturday through the 247sports network.

Grand Prix race in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after winning Sebastian Vettel
It became clear that since Valtteri Bottas Lewis Hamilton was ranked before the Mercedes team's orders would be dead or alive in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas had been doing well, and almost fired Hamilton in the first two to defend his place, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes, and Hamilton had to get into the final traffic of the troupe, which should have had a direct effect on the race.
The Mercedes later entered the boxes, and left behind Vettel, but after a competition Hamilton stepped ahead of him, for in the competition, made the interior free of Ferrari's driver to hold his position after a double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, began the race in the last row of the exit park, and finished his first tour in seventh place.
Next, he remained in the first place in a large part of the race, and by the end he held the tires to finish the race quickly and to advance Kimi Raikkon and get fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxes on tour 44, but was unable to live the pace at eight-two remaining, and Raikkonen acquired the fourth place.
It's not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and it's been really honest.
The team did a great job in the competition," Hamilton said.
They were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diane Feinstein during a demonstration held on Saturday for highlighting that she had not leaked the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who is accused of sexual assault to the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
When he spoke in a demonstration held in West Virginia, the president did not make a direct reference to the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate's Judicial Committee, instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that what is happening in the Senate is "bad, false, and liar".
"The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last few days, you see anger, that you see people who are angry, you see that people are evil, false, and lying," he said.
"You see publications and leaks and say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Remember his answer? Did you leak the letter? "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked the letter? No, we didn't leak it," he added, imitating the senator's reaction.
The letter explaining the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh went to Feinstein in July, and has leaked last September, but Feinstein has denied that the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not hidden Dr. Ford's allegations; I didn't leak his story," Feinstein explained to the Commission, as The Hill said.
"He asked me to keep him quiet, and I kept it secret, as he had asked."
But the fact that he denied it was not welcome to the president, who stated in the demonstration held on Saturday night: "I'll tell you: they were inappropriate gestures.
It may not have been him, but they were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen."
Following the defense of the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of inappropriate sexual attitude by three women, the president stated that the Democrats are using their claims for their own purposes.
"They are willing to do anything to restore power.
They are evil, it doesn't matter who they hurt, who should crush them to get power and control," said the president, as the Mediaite site has revealed.

An air controller has died to escape hundreds of passengers on an aircraft from an earthquake.
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could air properly and die.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday and causing a tsunami.
Many strong replicas have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position and leave the control tower of Mutiana Sis Al Jufri Airport.
In turn, it remained there to make sure Batik Air flight 6321 was properly aired, which was on the track at the time.
Next he jumped from the control tower when he saw he was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation Sirait said that thanks to this decision, hundreds of lives were saved, Australia's ABC News site reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palura.
"Our hearts break when they hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death rate will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesian table for disaster management says that access to the peoples of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the taxi will still grow, as many bodies are still under the ruins, and we have not been able to reach many others," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the table, said.
At most six meters waves have completely destroyed Palu; there will be a massive burial there on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing support and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma explained to the Sky News site, "Minus, an ambulance full of corpses arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food in small markets."
In Indonesia, head of the International Red Cross Jan Gelfand, explained to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working as quickly as possible to help those who survived, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The Indonesian President Game Widodo arrived in Palura on Sunday, and explained to the country's military personnel: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" the CNN chain announced.
This year another earthquake has also shaken Indonesia, which took place in Lombok, and more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the plane crash that occurred on a lake
The airline that operated on a Pacific lake in Micronesia now says that a man is missing, after 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated properly.
Air Niugini said in a publication until Saturday afternoon he was unable to make sure that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said he is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to journalists who asked for more details (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to rescue them at Chuuk Island Airport after the plane fell into the water.
The agents said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airlines said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Army have said that the plane fell on the lake next to the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane passed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had entered very low.
"That's a terrible good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and other passengers easily reached the sinking plane's emergency terraces along the water that reached their waists.
He said that the saffrons were scared and they were rioting, and that he had suffered a small wound in his head.
The U.S. Army said that the support of fishermen in the improvement of the pier was also very helpful in rescue work, for which a punct ship was used to carry passengers to the ground before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network network data, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents in the last two decades, but none have been due to Air Niugini.
An analyst has completed the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
As he presented to the jury, he used mobile phone records by the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers' 19-year-old victim to link the movements that the night she died.
Rowlett said that the woman died in the evening she received the location data on several mobile phones showing that she was with Tellis Chambers, so she contradicted Tellis' previous confirmation, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers at the moment when Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in the village that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, "because the truck was in Nashville."
There was also another incoherence: Tellis said he had known him two weeks when Chambers died.
According to mobile phone records, however, they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from the phone.
"He wiped her out of life," said Hale.
The defenses will begin with the last allegations on Sunday.
The judge said the trial will pass from the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio with hip-hop music wants to challenge people with a negative opinion on the type of music, and for this purpose they will fill their music with positive messages.
Bristol The High Breed group says that hip-hop music has abandoned political messages in its beginnings and the struggle of social problems.
They want to go back to its roots, and get the conscious hip-hop to be known again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen a revival of such hip-hop in the United Kingdom, such as Acala and Lowkey artists.
Another black man?!
A New York nurse sues a couple after a "racist" message for his dismissal.
A New York nurse has accused a couple of people who were not due to a mistake to discriminate and fired him after receiving a message from his mother."
The couple denied that he is racist, stating that the accusation is "too much".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised when he found out that the new worker would take care of the children, Giselle Maurice, was black, when Maurice came home in 2016.
"EEEEEEEE, another BELTZ," wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when he noticed his mistake, he felt "descently" in Plasco-Flaxman, and released Miss Maurice, the previous nurse, who was African-American, not a good worker and instead expected a Filipino nurse.
He paid Miss Maurice for that single working day, and asked for an Uber to take her home.
Now Maurice has accused the couple, and has asked for compensation for damages caused by the dismissal, including $350 for six months a day, and although he was not a contract, he was initially hired to live at home for six months and take care of it.
"I want to show them that things like this are not done," he explained to the Post newspaper on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has denied that he is racist, and said that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable and necessary because he was afraid they couldn't trust him after he insulted him.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco explained to the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have insulted, even if they were due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't even think about it."
When he explained that the accusation was "not for that," Plasco said that his wife had been less than two months ago and that she was "in a difficult state."
"Will you be looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investment bank.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the public opinion tribune has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, punishing him for his attitude and logic.
Paddington's publisher feared that readers would like a bear that speaks, as a new letter has shown
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter, "It's hard to put him in the place of someone who first read it before the book was published.
It's so fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success now."
My father was a BBC network cameraman thanks to a small toy bear before he was inspired to write the children's book; his daughter said his father had an optimistic attitude for having rejected his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "sweet" taste, who died last year.
As for Paddington, he says he was "an important member of the family", and his father was finally proud of his success.
"He was a silent man, and he was not vain," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he almost made it feel like a child who gets something: you feel proud of it, even if it wasn't your achievement in itself.
I think that's how he saw more or less of Paddington's success.
Although it was the creation of him and his imagination, Paddington always acknowledged merit to him."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
As soon as he landed, Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur was quickly taken to hospital, but doctors could do nothing to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say it was very serious, that he didn't think he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell him that he would die in the next two minutes and say I had to say hello to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors had given him to keep his heart beating exhausted and were gradually leaving his system.
He died a little earlier than he thought, and it was ready, it was over.
I could only sit down and wait, knowing that everything was going to start there.
I couldn't cry or scream, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had since been disappointed by the death of her daughter, climbed on the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgot the grief she felt.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"My head was bent, and tears came down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Some upset women put posters on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost people who loved as a result of suicide want to avoid more people taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed posters on a Welsh bridge, these posters have optimistic messages and phone numbers so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began to have depression problems, and killed herself when she was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney; she said her son had a special gift for cooking, and she had a contagious smile.
"They all knew him because of the smile.
They always said that his smile shone anywhere."
However, he left work before his death, because he was "very dark."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took off his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried if there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created some posters, "People can tell you that there are people who can tell you what happens to you and can help you, even if they are a friend.
Don't be silent; you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she also lost her partner for 15 years after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his position.
He was devastated on Christmas Day; when the children opened their presents, he did not even look at them."
He said that his death was a major trauma for them, but they have to move on: "He leaves a Husune in the family.
It makes us sick.
But we all have to move on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is shaken after FBI investigation begins
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for, such as a study of limited time or limited range, perhaps we could get a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid that the Board was "displeting" in the face of the trouble caused by passionate party parties.
Why didn't the FBI want the case to investigate Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican followers?
The opposite opinion is due to time.
There are only five weeks left for the middle election of the term: they will be on November 6. In which the Republicans are expected to achieve bad results, and if so, they will begin a very weakened race to exit the chosen man for the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has made many phone calls for senators and has imposed pressure on them to protect Mr. Kavanaugh, because Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI report?
The vote will be held in the Senate where 51 republicans and 49 Democrats sit at this point.
It is not yet clear in the Senate where Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes; if so, Vice President Mike Pence could break the draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of refugees has been "down" since Kim is in power
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to the data of the South Korean Unified Department, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 refugees who were in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and the establishment of greater fines to people dealers has had a major impact.
Pyongyang has not made a public comment.
North Korean refugees are offered to almost all South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest limit to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the demilitarized area between the two Koreans with strong protective measures (DMZ).
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often repatriation by force.
North Korea and South Korea are still in war by itself, both of them have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on the remaining denuclearization.
Previously, in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to the non-nuclear Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Affairs Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the fines imposed by the U.S. having not made any progress since.
"If we have no confidence in the U.S., we will have no confidence in our national security, and things like that, we will not leave our weapons first," said Mr. Ri in a speech of the United Nations General Assembly, which was held in New York.
Nancy Pelosi tells Brett Kavanaugh to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelos, the leader of the minority in the Chamber, has told Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and that he is not ready to be in the Supreme Court as far as genius is concerned.
Pelosi made comments in an interview on Saturday, which was held in Austin, Texas Tribune Festival.
"I could not prevent him from thinking that if a woman had ever acted like that, you would have told him to be "hissteric," said Pelosi; that was the reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Judicial Committee of the Senate.
Kavanaugh refused to sexually assault Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes almost shouted and spat when talking about his family and youth.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats of the Commission, and said that the allegations against him are "organized and offensive" organized by liberals who are angry for losing the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has an impartial opinion against Democrats.
"With these assertions and his attitude against Clintons and Democrats, he has been out of the league," he said.
Pelosi objected if Kavanaugh chose and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives when asked if he would oppose it.
"I'll say this: if it doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court, not to be in the court at the moment," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh D.C. is the Court of Appeals of the Circuit.
Pelos added, as a Democrat, he is worried about Kavanaugh's judgments against the law of available health care or Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the confirmation court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"A hysterical and impartial person cannot go to court and expect him to take it well," Pelosis said.
And women must order it.
It is a fair speech; a terrible rage of months and years, and he cannot release without crying.
"We cry when we grow up," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do I?"
He continued, "A woman who was an executive from somewhere helped me tremendously, and told me she was crying too when she was angry, but she developed a technique: when she got angry and crying, she said to the person who was talking to her: "As I'm crying, you can think I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Tears are not poorly seen to express rage, because they are partly misinterpreted.
I remember clearly something that happened to me in one of my first jobs, most of them were men in an office, where I was once crying with rage, and a more mature woman grabbed me by the neck. I was a little afraid of him from the beginning, he took me to the head of the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're furious.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understood you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic Assembly member of Colorado then, and worked with Gary Hart in his presidential races.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught in a ship called Monkey Business and his wife was not known to have a love relationship with another woman and refused the race, Miss Schroeder decided to be the same presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought decision," he said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "White Edurne and the seven gnomes".
As the campaign began long ago, he was following to collect money, so he decided that he would not enter the race until $2 million were collected.
The fight was lost.
He learned that some followers who gave the men $1,000 were given only $250.
"Do they think I have a difference?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and reported that he would not make an official campaign, he was very moved: he was very moved: he supported the gratitude for the people, money and the voters instead of the delegates made him so difficult to get his frustration with the system, and his anger with sexist attitudes.
"You must have thought I was very nervous," explained Miss Schroeder about the reaction that the press had seen her attitude.
"You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking about this: what will they write on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?"
The benefit of commercial wars between the US and China could bring to Beijing
The salvations that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the US and China were buzzing, and although the conflict is intense, the cracks between countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump dropped its first warning in the early year, then imposed a tax on the main products that China exported, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant climb has arrived this week, as new rates that will affect products worth of $200 billion ($50 billion) will apply to half of the goods that will be transported from China to the US.
Beijing has applied represals by fact every time, and the last one has been to raise tariffs by between five and ten per cent to American goods worth $60 billion.
China has said it will equalize each rise in the US, and the second strongest economy in the world will not change so easily blink in the opinion.
Asking Washington to go back would lead to court, but publicly surrender to the US would be more shameful to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing did well, pressures for commercial war in the United States could benefit China in the long run, as they would decrease their dependence between the two economies.
"Washington's politicians or Beijing's politicians would quickly create conditions for economic lazbin in some two countries. This is more dangerous than observers thought before," said researcher Abigail Grace, who investigates Asia in the New U.S. Security Centre.
Syria is "prest" for refugees to return, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said
Syria says it is ready to return refugees who wish to voluntarily return, and is asking for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the long war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the state of the country is improving.
"Today its situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the process of terrorism," he said.
The area destroyed by the government by terrorists continues to be restored to normal as quickly as possible.
Now, it is a good situation that refugees who wish to voluntarily return to the country that made terrorism and their daily lives and maintenance difficult to return to the country.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moalem said that the Syrian regime will greatly appreciate the help of rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he noted that he will not accept the support of the countries that were protected by conditional support or rebellions.
Europe receives the Ryder Cup victory held in Paris
After defeating the group of 0.55 points on the final marker, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at the outside Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The US has lost six times in a row on European land, and has not won a Ryder Cup cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again carried the crown when the Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points that the team needed to defeat the US.
The star Phil Mickelson in the United States had almost a bad time throughout the tournament, and threw the exit strike into the water in the 16th hole in part 3, so he passed the witness to Francesco Molina.
Italian golf player Milinari was very prominent in all shifts, and since the current format of the tournament began in 1979, it became one of the four players who had ever achieved results 5, 0, and 0.
Jordan Spieth achieved 5 and 4 results and stayed out against the worst player of the European team: Thorbjorn Olesen Danish.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, got 2 and 1 results against the Kingdomed Ian Poulter, and Ryder Cup reached the final of the cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, who participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the main European winner of the tournament with 25.5 racing points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't avoid it today.
It's been a tough year.
So he thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy, in fact, to get the cup back.
This is teamwork, and I am happy that I have been able to help," said García, excited, after Europe's victory.
He has passed the witness to the Spanish John Ram, who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods (2 and 1) on Sunday individual game.
"I feel very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing that man," said Rahm 23.
Woods lost four games he played in France, and now 13, 21, and has a record of 3 results in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics, for one of the best players ever, who won 14 main titles, only over Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend to find a solution to this situation, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, captain of the United States, said for the bad game of the group, "I'm proud of my boys; they've tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work out.
Bejondeiola to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll meet again, I'll collaborate with the U.S. PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm very proud to be their captain.
We must accept failure.
We're out."
