Members of the Welsh assembly have expressed their concerns that they "will be considered puppets"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed grief after hearing a suggestion to change the name of their office as MWP (a member of the Welsh Legislative Assembly).
This idea has arisen after developing plans to change its name to the Welsh Legislative Assembly.
Members of the political assembly are concerned that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour party in the Assembly has said that "that new name rhymes with the words English, Twp and Pwp."
If you're out of Wales: Wales, twp means "innocent" and pwp means "kaka".
For him, a member of the Scottish assembly has said that the entire group is "not very happy" and suggested seeking replacement names.
Also, a member of the Welsh Conservative party has said that "there is open" to new ideas to change the name, but has also expressed his concerns for the rhymes that may lead to MWP changes.
In order to better understand this conflict, it must be considered that the letters w in Wales and the English letter u in Yorkshire have a similar pronunciation.
On the other hand, the assembly commission, which is creating a legal draft for the changes of names, has said, "As for the members of the Union, they will have the sole responsibility of choosing the descriptives they wish to use."
According to the 2017 Act of the Welsh government, the Welsh assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to choose the proposed proposals and in general the name of the Welsh Legislature received many declarations of solidarity.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Members of the Welsh Legislature or WMP (in English), but the name MWP was most chosen in a public consultation.
Assembly members, on the other hand, suggest substitute options, but it can be extremely difficult to choose an option unanimously; particularly for Assembly Presidents, Elin Jones, who has had to send a draft with changes in a few weeks.
However, the legislature of changes to be made will affect the functioning of the assembly; among other things, rules will be created to avoid activities that would lead to the loss of a good name to members of the Assembly and the system layout of the assembly will be handled with the help of that law.
When discussing the change in legislation, members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make the decision of the applicants in regard to their names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether or not to change the name of the country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
This popular borough has been arranged to be able to resolve the long account of the last decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The government of Athens has long remarked that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly prevented the request to enter the European Union and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is an opponent of the plebiscite to change his name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say that it is only the price to be paid to enter the US and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church lose their voice due to the problems of Harlem churches
"I've talked to several elderly people and they say you could find a bar and church in every corner long ago," states Mr. Adams.
As of today, there is nothing."
He says it's normal for Tabern's disappearance.
"People use other methods to socialize," he explains.
"Taberns are no longer the neighborhood lounges used to bring people together".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained for asset sales will not be enough and "we will be at the start point again or later."
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and ownerships filled with people who don't care about the neighborhood sanctuary will be built.
He says "People who are going to buy housing in the communities are going to be white people," and therefore the churches will close fast because these new people are not members of the church congregations."
The two churches were built by white people's congregations before Harlem was a black metropolis; it was the Metropolis community of 1870 and was built a decade later by St. Martin.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a congregation of black people took the relay.
The black congregation of Reverendo John Howard Johnson took over St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against 125 commercial street shops in Harlem that did not hire or raise black people.
Due to a fire in 1939, the church had several damages, but Father Johnson's parishioners designed several plans to re-build the church and commissioned it to collect carilloy.
Reverendo David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heiress of St. Martin, named the carilloy "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who hit the carilloy in July gave it another name, "the treasure of culture" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also stated that it has been the first carilloy played by a black musician worldwide; the musician, Dionisio A. Lind, went to play the larger carilloi of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin has not replaced his musician.
In the past few months, St. Martin's has seen the weary departures of several architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by the laity leaders or the bishop's diocese.
The Parrot assembly (an artifact consisting of laity liaders), on the other hand, sent a letter in July to the diocese to check whether the contractions of these persons "sorry costs will pass into the parish" because the parish has nothing to do with the contractions of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have filed their complaints for the lack of transparency the diocese has had.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy when he was looking for oysters in the California Seaside
According to police, on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy when he was searching for oysters on the coast of California on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack was on the Beacon beach at Encinitas before 7 a.m.
According to Chad Hammel's statement to the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego, he was swimming with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour, but his friend, screaming, heard him ask for help; he then swam with a group of people to help his friend out of water.
Hammel, who had previously thought that he was screaming for joy at his friend's discovery of an oyster, thought that he was alive, but then realized that the friend was screaming "I've been costed!"
They bit me!
Hammel said, "I could have seen his whole cleavage," after seeing his friend.
"I shouted at everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark! screaming," Hammel explained.
The boy has been taken to the Rady children's hospital in San Diego and his condition is serious.
The species of shark that attacked could not be perceived.
Sorosle member Captain Larry Giles has filed a report before the media and said they have seen a shark a few weeks earlier, but it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles has also stated that the victim's injuries are at the top of the body.
Police have closed their entrances from the Ponto beach in Casablade to the Swami beach in Encinitas in order to conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure people's safety.
According to Giles's explanation, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans into the United Kingdom's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers large-storey-style beauty departments with a number of expert and specialized employees.
While sales of fashion and domestic products are decreasing, £2.8 billion has been invested in the United Kingdom's beauty sector, which is growing limitlessly; larger beauty departments will be built and tested at 11 stores in the country. If good results are reported, more stores will be opened next year.
Thanks to investments in beauty art, supermarkets can take advantage of television, microwave-lave, and departments selling domestic products.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty-produced offering will double and offer over 3000 products; it will also place Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands under customer jurisdiction.
As for L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees Tickets, they will have more space in branded areas, like areas that can be found in Boots stores.
Additionally, the supermarket re-presents its "Boutique" brand makeup, which is a fully vegan product; younger buyers demand such products increasingly.
Furthermore, she will test the grants offered by the perfumer Fragrance Shop in two stores of Sainsbury's supermarkets; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week and, the second in Selly Oak (Birmingham), will open at the end of the year.
Caused by online shopping and a tendency to buy food in small local stores every day, supermarkets must work head and ear to attract customers.
Mike Coup, Sainsbury's chief manager of supermarkets, has said that sales points will take the style of large stalls and that the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of competitors Aldi and Lidl offering more products that are not service and food.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats after the two chains bought two years ago, for which reason the sale of food has been strengthened and the chains purchased are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to re-open the beauty and medicine departments, but the strategy failed.
He then joined Sainsbury's Boots in early 2000, but that partnership ended because the process of splitting profits obtained in supermarket medicine departments had become a burning role.
A new strategy was organized when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281 stores of medicine to Celesium, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million libe three years ago.
The Lloyds chain will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a large set of luxury brands to watch the cover in four stores; including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets said, "We have improved the look of the beauty departments so that our customers can find perfect environments.
We have also hired experienced workers to provide specific advice with regard to products.
We have designed our set of brands to fulfill all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments provide a modern and easy opportunity for the shops that use obsolete methods."
Peter Jones is "daunted" after Holly Willoughby dropped her offer of 11 million francs.
Dragons Den program star Peter Jones went "serious" after television writer Holly Willoughby dropped her offer of £11 million related to the eternal brand business because she wants to pay full attention to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV companies.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand that sells domestic products and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the programme This Morning, 37, was used by Instagram to present his resignation.
As a result of Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept the contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV companies, Dragons" Den program star Peter Jones was extremely upset at leaving the big profit business created between them at the last minute.
According to our sources, on Tuesday a rally was held at the main sede in Marlowe and by this point Jones was "seriously angry" when he heard the explanation of our most famous TV woman: that she would accept new contracts of £1.5 million and therefore not be able to spend more time on domestic products and components of the Truly brand.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Willoughby's 11 million pound property.
Willoughby, 37, having stated on Instagram that leaving the Truly brand business, Jones left the United Kingdom to go to a holiday home.
One source said, "There has always been that possibility among Holly's priorities.
Thanks to this decision, he will have the future guaranteed for the next two decades.
However, the decision to leave the mark has kept us out of our mouths.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday; just when the brand offer was about to close.
In fact, the Marlowe residence store is full of goods to be sold."
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of francs for going to host the programme This Morning (which is the most profitable presenter in the United Kingdom); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including cushions, candles, clothing, and household products) and will now have to deal with delays that can be created.
Moreover, this conflict may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created the Truly brand in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered March as director.
The two couples always arrange their holidays together and Baldwin's television production is 40 per cent by Jones.
Willoughby will be an ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV channel I'm A Celebrity program.
A source from Jones' team last night stated that he "would not say anything about his business activities."
A rough conversation, yes, but then "we were in love."
He joked about the misconduct he was supposed to suffer because of the media, all for making a "disappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so many things?
Trump has used his "television writer" voice to respond in tweets:
"I didn't give anything."
After the first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said he wants to set up a second meeting and, thanks to this, a hugely important step has been taken in the way of nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has been halted.
After three months of meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said to the leaders of the UN world: In the general assembly on Saturday, North Korea has not seen "a proper response" on the part of the United States, in regards to the country's steps in the way of nuclear disarmament.
Instead, penalties imposed by the United States have been hardened in order to keep the country pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic view and has expressed such in his final speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever," he said.
"In addition, we were about to declare war with North Korea."
Millions of people could be killed by that war.
But now we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
He further said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in good results; among other things, tests with missiles have ended, hostage release processes have improved and the delay of the rest of the United States military is ongoing.
He also explains his unusual point of view, with regard to interviews with Kim.
"It's really easy the President's job, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to force their way into the country, we have 200 people here," Trump said while pointing to the personal gathered there.
Indonesian tsunamis and earthquakes have destroyed an island and left hundreds dead
After the Lombo earthquake, for example, support for non-profit organizations was unnecessary.
Although 10 per cent of the Lombok population is offset, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (it is a precondition to call for help from thenats).
"In some cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said it didn't need international help, so it's a challenge to this situation," Ms Sumbung says.
Save the Children's organization is forming a group that will go to Palu, but still does not know if volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, the agency's representative for national disasters, according to what has been said, Indonesian officers are working in Palu so they can accept international agent support.
Despite Indonesia experiencing several earthquakes, the country has subdivided measures to combat the rage of nature.
Forts against the tsunamis have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu doesn't have a siren to warn people and, although the warning is ongoing, maybe that's why so many are dead.
When there is good weather, traveling between the islands of Indonesia may be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters make efforts difficult to implement logistics.
To provide treatment to the victims of the earthquake a hospital ship was anchored in Lombok and now goes to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo's campaign was based on projects to improve infrastructure in Indonesia and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funds have been reduced and the administration of President Game is in embarrassment as the next year's election prepares.
Also, Mr. Joko has trouble controlling the pullouts of sects in Indonesia; for example, most members of the Islamic Party have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result of this, more than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands have lost their homes because the flags of Christians and Islamic people have taken their battles to the streets; among others, they use machetes, bows, arrows, and similar weapons.

The Cromwell State of Parliament becomes the ultimate goal of the tendency to "rewrite history"
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed so many religious objects, the Puritan fanatics of England did the same with so many historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "mindedness" and that he is "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, a representative of the Cromwell Society, said, "The dispute arising from the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside the Palace of Westminster is inevitable; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself has never requested or organized the iconoclasms of civil wars in England.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the actions his ancestor, Thomas, did in the previous century.
The impressive depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is part of the opinions of the 19th century and our historiography; so many people still believe that the actions of that person must be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, "No fewer people than in the 19th century believe this, yes, but a number of people still believe Cromwell was a defender of parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
It will remain the substance of historical discussions whether it is an accurate representation of that person.
However, we can safely say that the conflict that occurred in the middle of the 17th century has been the starting point of our country's development, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties involved in that starting point.
That he had the title of "Lord Protector" may even be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he earned."
A pig is killed by a Chinese farmer
A pig has attacked and killed a farmer in a market in China's southwest, according to local media.
The man with the surname "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had an artery cut off and he was covered with blood in a pighouse of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, according to the South China Morning Post specified on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the pig breeder prepares to insert pigs at Xining in China's Qinghai province.
Typically, on Wednesdays, Yunnan travels from the province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the dead man's body and saw that the door of the neighbouring pighouse was open.
He also stated that there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth in the porkyard.
The court analysis report has confirmed that it was a 550-franc pig who killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and broken," the cousin explained in the Guiyang Evening News, whose surname is "Wu."
According to security camera recordings, Yuan can be seen entering the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 a.m. (oldgun).
His body was found one hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin's stomach.
According to a market boss told the Evening News newspaper, the pig is locked to avoid further attacks and let the police gather evidence of the site.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiated a compensation for his death.
Although rare, several pig attacks have been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the Massachusetts basalt, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 francs had surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor until the man's wife had driven the animal away.
In 2012, the pigs of an Oregon farmer ate his body and after that a Manitoba farmer said on the CBC News that your pigs aren't aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, that can function as "builders".
"They love playing.
They're like kids and they're very curious—they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Little storms of hurricane Rosa will leave rain showers in the southwestern United States
According to the weather, Rosa is weakening to the hurricane as it flows into the cold waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain showers to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will produce 85 miles per hour winds, and become a Category 1 hurricane. According to Eastern Time, on Sunday, it was found 385 miles from Punta Eugenia in southwest Mexico.
Thus, on Sunday Rosa is expected to go north.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure point is rising in the Pacific Ocean and it will head east to the west coasts of the United States. on Monday, Rosa Baja will head to California's mainland becoming a tropical storm and lead to tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Furthermore, on Monday Rosa will bring 10 inch of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will be combined with the low-pressure point and large rainfall will result in the southwest during the coming days.
In local places, 1-4 inch of water can be dangerous because sudden flooding, waste streams, and landfall can arise in the desert.
Rains produced by large tropical humidity can leave 2 to 3 inches of water per hour and in specific places; particularly, in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Southwest is expected to collect 2-4 inch of water, particularly on the Arizona side.
As tropical rains are wandering, they can cause sudden flooding and conditions of disturbance.
It is not recommended at all that we travel into the desert if a tropical storm has been warned.
Rainfall can turn rocks into violent streams and storms can bring gusty winds and dust.
Furthermore, as pressure will come down, there will be local rain showers on the southern coasts of California.
Due to rain it can be harvested by half an inch of water and may result in small streams of debris and sliding roads.
That may be the first rainforest of the region's rainy season.
Also, on Sunday and Monday, some scattered tropical rains may arise in Arizona, but there will be more rainfall on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, rain showers will go to the four corners and expire until Wednesday.
October may have severe temperature changes in the United States to the extent that Arctic territory cools, but the warm temperatures of the troupes will remain.
These temperatures sometimes have great changes in short distances.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and the cities of St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the warmth of summer will come and spread everywhere.
The middle and east of the United States will have a warm October; there will be temperatures of 80 degrees from the southern fields to the northeast.
Also on Tuesday, there may be 80 degrees in New York; approximately 10 degrees more than the average temperature.
According to long-term weather forecasting, the Eastern United States will experience temperatures greater than average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people saw in Tuesday's sixth channel news the impressive declarations of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaughen and Christine Blasey Ford; the latter accused Kavanaugh of sexual abuse suffered in 1980.
Meanwhile, political conflict followed and channel presenters suspended Friday's permanent programming to give a last-minute news report: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed with the FBI in order to conduct a one-week investigation.
According to Ford's statement to the Senate magistrate-bass, he is quite certain that Kavanaugh touched him repeatedly while drunk and tried to take his clothes off during a high school party.
In part of Kavanaugh, he said in a passionate declaration that he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's data, the declaration was cleared of approximately 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels that gave the declaration; including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
Additionally, Nielsen is usually in trouble counting people who watch television in offices.
For an example, we can say the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's declaration is fully acceptable to channel presenters and, on average, had 5.69 million viewers while making the declaration, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had $3.1 million, NBC got $2.94 million, MSNBC had $2.89 million, and CNN had $2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the declaration was heard, people's interest remained.
Flake was the heart of Friday's drama.
After it was reported that the moderate Republican Party office would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS channels recorded Kavanaugh on Friday surrounded by protesters to declare at the Magistratura merger while trying to take an elevator.
It was seen live on the CNN channel with a look down while the protesters quarreled.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have an ugly power, but so many women have nothing."
At that moment and before the elevator doors were closed, Flake said that his office had published a notification and will provide further details during the meeting visit.
The cable and television networks were broadcast live every hour and, meanwhile, the Magistratura-Battle was voting for Kavanaugh as a senator.
However, Flak said he would vote after the FBI examined the arguments against the candidate for a week; remember that the minority Democrat was asking him to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons, Flake had almost convictions in the investigation.
After talks with Coons and several senators, Flak made his final decision.
Flak's decision was powerful because the Republican party does not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing with politics" on the basis of Brexit

A gunshot killed Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson for murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspected person for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in jail for a secondary murder offence, said Baton Rouge police department.
Police have shared video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson and, according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.

The department thanks the department for finding fugitives from Louisiana State Police, the state police's criminology lab, the Southern Union police, and the surrounding citizens for assisting in the investigation to find the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva has thanked the police for his "prudence and protection of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-foot player grew up in Baton Rouge and his father also played basketball at Wayne, LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 bounces in the divisions of the final season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "earthed" and "surprised" by Wayden's death.
"These are things that always bother you," Wade said.
A volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
The ashes dumped by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached as far as the southern suburbs of the city of Mexico.
The national center prior to the disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that they be removed from the volcano after several perceived activity in the crater; 183 gas and ash leaks were recorded for 24 hours.
Half of the volcano also had several tremors.
According to figures on social networks, thin layers of ash can be seen in the windshields of cars in certain neighborhoods of the Mexican city (e.g. Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have observed that activity of the volcano 45 miles (72 miles) south of the capital has increased since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 shook the middle of Mexico.
The volcano with the name "Don Goyo" being active since 1994.
The fight between the police and Catalonia Independents to vote for independence before the anniversary
Six people have been arrested this Saturday in Barcelona, while protesters for independence joined the parties where thousands of people joined the riot police to remember the first anniversary of their elections to vote for independence in Catalonia.
He stopped a group of defectors disguised as police officers against the riots, but they threw eggs and paint powder at them, thereby resulting in dust clouds in the streets filled with tourists.
Further fighting ensued later because the police were using their trawlers to stop the quarrel.
Also, groups for independence went through several hours singing "We won't forget, we won't forgive" in front of the Unionists, who were singing "Long Life to Spain".
According to local journalists, fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received during the clashes.
There is much nervousness in this land that is trying to find independence after the election on 1 October, which was illegal according to the Madrid government, but Catalonia's Independents got a day to celebrate it.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the citizen participation was very small due to the number of citizens opposed to the independence they wanted to boycott the election.
According to Catalonia authorities, 1000 were injured after the police attack because voters had gone to places where there were voting ships for the election to stop voters; therefore, there were violent clashes.
Independent groups have camped on Friday to avoid a demonstration for the national police.
The march was held, but was forced to take another course.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the demonstration for independence with his wife, and said that he no longer hopes Catalonia will gain independence.
"We spent a wonderful moment last year.
My parents wept with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After a plight but important victory in last December's local elections, Catalan parties for independence have had many issues to keep people's interest this year; certain party leaders are either exiled or arrested and are now waiting for a trial for organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic is recording a demonstration for the police on her phone and says that politicians from both parties are guilty of this situation.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been waiting for the trial in prison since last year, stated that he would participate in the European Parliament elections scheduled for next year.
"If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the restriction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men are arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for repeatedly hitting a house in Londonderry with the car.
The event was held at Ballynagard Crescent at 19:30 p.m. (BST) on Tuesday.
Inspector Bob Blemmings has said that the building and its doors have been damaged.
They also appear to have used a whale in the car.
Thanks to Menga's throw, Livingston scores 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's tally
The promoted Livingston has impressed Rangers players and Steven Gerrard gets his second defeat in 18 divisions as Ibrox club leader.
Dolly Menga's throw was crucial that the Hibernian team from Gary Holten was promoted in the second part.
Gerrard's team is unbeaten this season in the Premiership and will have to play against the Hearts leaders (who have eight more points) next Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team is unbeaten and there are six games left this season; coach Holt does not know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston loses several opportunities in front of strong visitors
Holten's team had to go ahead before the goal was scored; as he has tremendous integrity, he caused several problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and Alan Lithgow then redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play, but they knew the visitors might bother them at any time.
And with that mood came the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave up a free throw and Livingston created an opening pitch; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to mark Menga, but the latter scored the goal if they touched the ball in the middle of the door.
At that stage of the game, the Rangers dominated the possession, but the home defense was ineligible and the janitor Liam Kelly spent the game without difficulty.
That pattern followed up to half of the second part, but the cast of Alfredo Morelos called for Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not mark the goal for Rangers' janitor Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's other move.
Walks went back and forth into Livingston's area and were repeatedly pulled out by home players; two penalties were requested, with Halkett challenging Representative Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand, but both were rejected.
Livingston's "chuckled" game - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the Scottish BBC at Tony Macaroni Arena
It's been a perfect game for Livingston and a perfect result.
They've made extraordinary moves for me and they've got really good chances to step up.
The style of the games and team has hardly changed since they reached the top level, but Holt has been an exceptional coach: he has set the team straight the way since his arrival.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been enormous; he has organized and managed an excellent defense and, Menga has taken care of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to make him nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers did not have much inspiration, however.
When they are under Gerrard's orders they work very well, but the standards set by the coach have been forgotten.
The final game has been too weak and only once have they defeated the homers' defense; the Rangers must hurry if they want to get them out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds opposite welcomes in the colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit in Germany; the visit was arranged to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed some issues; including the lack of human rights and press freedom and access to Turkey in the European Union.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to the colony to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
Due to security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people who wanted to meet in front of the mosque were blocked, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan (most were Kurdish) brought together their voices to protest against Erdogan's policy measures and the German government's decision to welcome the President.
The President reflected the differences on both sides; some German Turks say he is a hero and the others say he is only an autocrat.
Deptford road crash: A rider has died from the collision with a car
A rider has died from the collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m.; that road in Deptford southeast of the city is usually flooded with cars.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died in the spot.
In Childers Street, about a mile from the accident that occurred on Saturday, another rider died a month ago and the driver escaped.
Metropolitan police are working to identify the man and warn his family.
Some roads have been closed and the eternal route of bus lines has been changed; it is also recommended to motor drivers to avoid that area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a quarrel
Six prison officers have been injured in a quarrel in the men's high security prison, the prison's office has said.
The quarrel arose at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 a.m. (BST) on Sunday morning and has not yet ended the riots.
Expert "Tornado" officers have arrived in prison to end the quarrel begun by eight arrested; for now, it has been confined to a wing of the building.
Officials had minor injuries to their faces and were cured there.
A representative of the prison's service has said, "We have sent expert staff of the prison to end the riots at HMP Long Lartin.
We've cured six workers of the wounds we've taken.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who have begun the quarrel will be delivered to the police and will probably spend more time in the prison."
HMP Long Lartin Prison has over 500 arrests and, among them, the country's most violent criminals.
In June the prison's alkade had to go to the hospital for the assault of an arrest.
In addition, last October anti-war officers were to go to prison to stop a serious quarrel because the detainees were attacking the workers with the sticks of the billiards.
Rosa hurricane has become a threat to sudden flooding in the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possibly the driest area to benefit some)
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but that's what will happen next week as hurricane Rosa exhausts its strength; it will visit the southwest desert and risk sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued a warning on Monday and Friday about the sudden flooding that may arise; it will enter Arizona's westbound hurricane and run to the south and east of Nevada.It will also pass through the southern parts of California and Utah; including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be on Monday will reveal her arrival.
The Phoenix national weather service has written that in a tweet "from 1950, ten tropical cyclones created 200 miles from Phoenix have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
According to the recent predictions of the hurricane's national center, 2-4 inches of water will be collected, and at the edge of Mogollon in Arizona will be collected at a maximum of 6 inches of water.
As for other areas southwest of the desert (the Rocky Mountains of the Middle and the Great Arro, among others), 1-2 inches of water will be collected; in isolated places there will be a maximum of 4 inches collected.
As for those who expect sudden flooding, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because of droughts experienced by the territory.
The floods are not to be underestimated, but these rainforests may be beneficial due to droughts experiencing the southwest.
According to the United States drought control service, 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing severe droughts, which is the second highest category, the weather.com site stated.
First, the route of hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja Californa Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa will remain hurricane strength on Sunday morning and produce at most 85 miles per hour winds; Mexico's Punta will then be 385 miles south of Eugenia, and it will have a speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific and thereby weakening its power.
Thus, it will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or overnight as a tropical storm.
As there may be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to the weather.com site, "the rains will leave 3 to 6 inches of water southwest of Baja California to Sonora, and may gather 10 inches in some places."
Then Rosa will pass from the north of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border as a tropical depression in Tuesday's morning hours; then it will cross Arizona and go south Tuesday night to Utah.
"The main threats of Rosa or her storms are the severe storms that will arise in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the southwest desert of the United States," the national hurricane center said.
These rains will cause dangerous flooding and waste running in deserts and landfall in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempting to kill someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for the murder effort after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 local time on Saturday morning (BST).
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man was arrested overnight in the Radstock area (in Avon and Somerset), police have said.
If anyone has a record or traces of what happened to the phone, the police members have asked for his help.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "must endure a rage without conviction" from the Democrat party.
"The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh deny the ruthless and angry tactics of the Democrat party," Trump said in his mitigation of Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh should suffer from the Democrats' "seriousness and rage" in his naming process.
On Tuesday Kavanaugh testified before Congress, and completely refuted the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford; according to the woman, she was raped by Kavanaugh decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his advocacy.
The president said on Saturday, "The citizens of the United States saw Kavanaugh's courage, intelligence, and quality that day."
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this jurist has spent his entire life protecting public services," the president said to West Virginia supporters.
Not only about Kavanaugh's nomination, but the president also spoke about the importance of the Republican party in these elections.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not going to be part of it, but I'm going to campaign," he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight with the most perfect candidates."
Trump also said that the Democrat party campaign is using strategies to "occupy and make it difficult".
According to what a high-ranking Republican party has said to CNN, the procedural act of naming Kavanaugh will be done in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami; the number of dead increases
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died from earthquakes and tsunamis caused to Sulawesi Island in Indonesia; most died while huge waves destroyed beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in Palu, but by evening the waves of six feet (18 feet) had destroyed the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything on the way was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat warning was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach performing various activities and did not immediately escape, which is why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in an interview with the agency's (BNPB) representative in Jakarta to avoid disasters in Indonesia.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything that was in the country" says Nugroho; indeed, the tsunami has traveled from the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before reaching the coast.
"A number of people have climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived," the representative said.
Approximately 16,700 people have attended 24 centers in Palu.
With several buildings and shops destroyed, a mosque surrounded by broken bridges and water can be seen in aerial photographs taken by the disaster-proof agency.
Remains of the earthquake continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a territory of 2.4 million people.
According to the report published by the agency to validate and apply Indonesian Technology (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city may have been related to the size of the tsunami, which is in a long and narrow bay, the agency said.
According to Nugroho's statement, the disaster has been overwhelmingly "healthy"; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers, and hotels have been demolished.
Some victims' bodies have been found among the debris of the destroyed buildings, whereby there are 540 more injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said that the number and disaster of the victims can increase along the 300-mile (190 miles) coast of Palu; particularly a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
The Donggala media "don't work and we don't have any information," Nugroho stated.
According to the Red Cross data, there are over 300,000 inhabitants in that place; for now, they are going to places affected by the organization's staff and volunteers to offer assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be a lot worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency received strict criticism for not providing information about the tsunami that destroyed Palu, but according to officers, waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a recording shared on social networks, a man in a building can be seen, and is shouting "sunami coming" to warn the people of the street.
A few minutes later the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
As earthquakes have generated general electricity cuts, all commuters in Palu have been suspended; therefore, it has been difficult for handicapped authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities in cargo aircraft, but the evacuated still require food and priority goods.
The city's airport has re-opened to facilitate relief efforts and will be closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres of Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami leaves more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Workers from the World Vision organization in Donggala have arrived in the city of Palu without difficulty (the workers there have built olana shelters in the organization's office yard), but they have seen directly the terrible situation left by the disaster, Mr Doseba has said.
"They told me they'd seen a lot of homes ruined," he said.
That's really bad.
Although aid groups engaged in the sad repairs of jobs in cases of disasters, experienced workers and supporters complained about what they had given their recommendation not to go to Palu.
Following Indonesian law, the provision of international funding, supplies and personnel can only begin after the zone has been classified as a nation disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial-wide disaster," says Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"The government, in what has been said "OK, it's a national disaster," we can open the doors to receive international support, but it hasn't yet been classified as such."
On the second night spent in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who were still missing had not yet lost the hope of a miracle of scarce probability of appearing loved ones.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman who was stuck under the debris for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandon, coach of the Indonesian nation parapenate team trained two of the parapentists who had been members of the missing Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi Jn., were students.
"As an expert in the world of parliament, if I have my emotional charge," he said.
Gendon Jn. explained that since reports in the parapentists community around the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel in the next few hours, he had been posting WhatsApp messages to competitors, who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only got one gray arrow, two blue marks.
"I think that means those messages were not sent," he added.
The robbers stole $26,750 when they were filling up automatic safemen at Newport on the Leveen
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee who was filling an automatic Boxer at Newport on the Brink, according to news from the Newport Police Department.
The driver car was draining the automatic cashier into the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the notification.
While working, another man "throwed the Brink staff from the door" and stole a bag of the money he was supposed to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scenario, according to what was stated in the notification, but police did not specify the number of those involved in the surprise.
If you have any information on their identity, contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapero changed his name, it's Ye now
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name - it's Ye now.
The change was reported on Saturday on Twitter: "The creature was known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has used the ill-fated Yee for some time, and has used that bad name as the title to his eighth album he has revealed in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, as no was expected to present his final album Yandhi.
He took part in the show in place of Ariana Grande, the show's creator, who, due to "the emotional reasons" could not participate.
In addition to being shortlisted for his current professional name, West has stated that this word also has religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible (English) and means 'you' in the Bible," stated West recently, speaking to radio presenter Big Boy about the album.
"So it's me, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, who means only one, to become Ye- into a reflection of our good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This work reflects better on who we are."
He is one of the famous rappers who has changed his name.
We have also known Sean Combs as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has stated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly collaborated with West, has also changed the hyphen and the serious letters.
Mexico's AMLO has pledged not to use the army against citizens
The elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged not to use the armed force or army against the citizens when the country will live the 50th birthday of a reprisal that shed blood against students.
Lopez Obradore, on Saturday vowed that he will never "use the army to repress Mexican citizens" at Tlatelolco Plaza.
On October 2, 1968, the army fired against a peaceful scene in the square, and 300 people were killed to interrupt the rise of left-wing students who were taking force throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obradore has promised to help the Mexicans learn, with monthly funding and more public free colleges opening.
In his own words, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourages young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double the funding of AI
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, it should double the amount U.S. uses to study in that area, says Kai-Fu Lee investor and AIan expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies.
Comments arose when several parties in the U.S. government made several notifications about the AI, although the U.S. generally does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AAA investigation, because the other countries are far from the US and are looking for the next discovery in AA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding in the US can double the chances of making large AI discoveries, Lee stated to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of Sinovation Ventures, which has investigated in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++, that is.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AA system that oversaw America's top Othello player and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research, and was Google's president in the Chinese area.
Lee praised the technology competitions prior to the U.S. government, including the Robotic Competition of the Advanced Defense Projects Research Agency, and asked when it will be next to help identify the next dreamers.
U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get government funding, says Lee.
"It doesn't mean China carries academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee added.
Facebook, Google and several other technology companies have taken the smartest of universities to act in AA in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies would also help to encourage U.S. AI acts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to Doctors of AA," he stated.
The Chinese State Council issued the Next Generation Development Plan of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation finances the people of academic institutions as the nation's Science Foundation and other government institutions do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is less, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense had created an Artificial Intelligence Center where partners in industry and education had gathered, and the White House reported that it had formed the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA has reported a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI COUNT.
As for the NSF, it invests more than $100 million a day in AA's research.
Meanwhile, the US legislation intended to form the National Security Committee around Artificial Intelligence has not had any advances in recent months.
The Macedonians were relegated to decide whether or not to change the name of the country.
The country of Macedonia voted by referendum on Sunday to decide whether or not to change the name of "the ancient republic of Macedon".This change would end several decades of conflict since the possibility of membership of the European Union and NATO was blocked by Greece.
Greece, which formerly had a province called Macedonia, still claims that the name of the northern residents takes its territory, and blocks the possibility of entering NATO and the US.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but national rivals say that this change is to harm the ethnic personality of most Slavic citizens in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and his boycott to the campaign caused doubts about whether to obtain 50 per cent of what will have to be achieved in the referendum to be valid.
This is the question that could be read on the paper of the referendum: "Are you in favor of being a NATO and US member with Greek consent?"
Those in favor of changing their name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth getting the opportunity to enter the US and NATO institutions for Macedonia, being one of the countries created when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I come to vote around the future of the country, for young men in Macedonia, to live free because under the umbrella of the European Union this will bring us a safer life," stated Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it crucial.
To change the name will require three-thirds of the parliament.
The state selection committee stated that there were no reports of surprises until one o'clock in the noon.
However, he has only voted 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent of the last elections for the 2016 parliament, in which he was voted by 66 per cent of those who were entitled to vote.
"I went to vote for my children, there's our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevsky, 62, capital, Skopje voter.
Macedonian Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in favor of changing the country's name in the Macedonian referendum and being able to enter NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small scenario and stairs to climb in front of the shops that wanted to boycott the referee.
"We are on the side of NATO and the US, but we want to meet with our conditions and not stuck through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want us as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and be part of the unification of Euro-Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership can bring such necessary investment to Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.
"I think the population will be in favor because more than 80 per cent of citizens support the US and NATO," stated Zaev after the vote.
In his own words, saying "yes" would "confirm our future."
According to the poll published by the Organization for Political Research in Macedonia on past Monday, it would take between 30 and 43 per cent of voters in voting - less than necessary.
Another poll, of Telma TV in Macedonia, said that 57 per cent of residents thought about voting on Sunday.
Of these, he stated that 70 per cent would drop out of favor.
To be a successful referendum, you have to get 50 per cent plus a vote in favor.
If there was a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious void of politics for the West since it began in May last year.
See: Manchester City team player Sergio Aguero has passed all of Brighton's defense to score the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling surpassed all of Brighton's defense in the Manchester City team's 2-0 Saturday victory at Etihad Stadium football ground in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored the winning goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper picked up a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He pushed a defender after escaping several others on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he walked to the left, where Sterling was.
The English frontman returned the ball to Aguero in the first touch inside the area, who used his right foot to overcome Brighton janitor Mathew Ryan with the shot aimed at the right of the net.
"Aguero is overcoming several issues at the foot" stated to reporters by City's coach, Pep Guardiola.
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were very glad that he scored the goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave the blueshirts the initial advantage in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in Brighton's field during the play.
He took an excellent walk on the left side to Leroy Sane.
San made a few touches to the far post before directing Sterling.
The blue-lipped Elastic pushed the ball into the net before exiting the line.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League competition on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m., the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end to the Rockies.
With the Nationals expelled from the competition, there was little reason to force him to another start.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to draw an advantage on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but they still experience the effects of equality by the Rockies, who still have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
The Rockies have achieved a wildcard winning at least 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but will still have to try to win their first first first-class title.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least, we know that the Denver atmosphere will be crowded, and that the opposing team will play in the best of all areas we're going to have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a launcher, but in that situation it seems likely that Scherzer will be allowed to launch.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a launch show on Thursday and seems to be acting as a shooter on Sunday.
Washington's right hand has 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and has achieved 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this year's season.
Trump's statements in West Virginia
The president looked over the situation and mentioned the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who had been chosen by him in the Supreme Court, when he was talking about the importance of Republican involvement in the mid season elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks later we have the most important elections in our lives.
He's one of the big ones -- I'm not a candidate but, in fact, I'm, that's why I'm everywhere to contest big candidates," he stated.
Trump added, "You can see the extreme huge group of Democrats, you can see what's going on there.
And they have no doubt of using any necessary means to take away power, see meanness, see irreverence.
They don't care who to hurt, who to get control and power over, we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are intended to "provide and hinder."
He added that the Democrats "are angry and wise and are disgusting and false as you have been able to see for the last four days."
He gave the name of Dianne Feinstein, Senator of the Democratic Party, of the Senate Court Committee, who received audience cries.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what.
No, ah, no, I'm waiting for one - that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labourers will not continue to have a great reach.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When activists from my local party Momentum voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last from the list of those who weren't welcome from the Labour MPs - for saying what we all thought.
Joan Ryan, who is a member of Parliament, also received similar treatment because she spoke for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy in the nation's security, in Europe, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on similar matters.
The news about the meeting in East Nottingham on Friday said "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During the eight years I have been serving as a local Labour MP, Friday night's GC meetings have been that.
Unfortunately, it has not been remembered today that the word to make politics "beautiful, respectful" if there has ever been.
It is becoming apparent that there are different views in the Labour party and whether opinions are acceptable to the party's leaders are judged.
This began when Jeremy became a leader, when members with the same political views began to turn 180 degrees ahead and demand that I accept views that I would never accept - as regards both national security and the only market in the UK.
Every time I spoke in public - no matter what I said - a lot of opinions that demand that I denounce middle-class policies on social networks and get rid of me from it, persecution, happens on the part of those who say I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm better lucky than some of my colleagues because the opinions cast against me are political.
Every day I depend on sexism or the friends who have to deal with race pursuits with professionalism and honesty, but never with shame.
One of the unpleasant aspects of politics at this time is that the current level of persecution is given as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, stated last week that the Labour party should promote the culture of tolerance.
Actually, we don't get one opinion on every motion in "untrust" or when the party's rules become narrower.
In the past two years I have received so many notes to lower my head, not to speak so much, and thus to say, "I should be well."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I dropped the room under the indifference of Thatcher's government and entered the public services that needed me the most - as a local councillor or government minister.
I have never concealed my political beliefs, not in the final edition.
No one in East Nottingham will hesitate about my political views and my disagreements with current leaders.
I would tell those who encouraged Friday's motion that when the country is running towards Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses, and public services, I don't understand the loss of time and energy in discussing my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to encourage Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether or not I'm a member of the Labour Party: I'm very proud of working for you and I promise you to continue working for what's best for your interests I'm not going to be removed either by threats or by political interference.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: There's Ayr leader who hasn't lost a game yet
The two unexpected final attempts somehow changed the final result, but without any doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in the match of the day of the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship.
They are in first place on the board, and are the only ones who have not lost one out of ten games.
At the end, they had a better defense, and took better advantage of their chances – the homers and coach Peter Murchie have a full right to be happy.
"We've been put on the test so far, and we haven't lost one, so we have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose added, "My honors to Ayr because they used opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute rehearsal, carried out by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, the yellow card taken from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by Warriors for the game, enabled Melros to add points and Jason Baggott failed to make the try.
Climo interfered with the Ayr leader by penalty. Before that, at the end of the first part, he performed the individual rehearsal and Ayr went 17-5 to the break.
But Melrose started excellent in the second part and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, realized by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there has been a long break due to the serious injury of player Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out on the handboard and, on his return to the game, Ayr came further away when Stafford McDowall's rehearsal was converted by Climo.
Then the captain of Blair Macpherson Ayr was issued a yellow card and again Melros benefited from being one more man with Bruce Colvine's rehearsal that did not take place during the live ending.
The family returned, and when the yellow card was taken from Struan Hutchinson to prevent Climo from balloting, from penultimate line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the maul of the Ayr who was advancing.
Climo scored, as he had done almost from the start, as Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and knocked out winger Gregor Henry during the house's fifth rehearsal.
The star of the Still Game series will begin a new career in the restaurant industry.
The actor Ford Kieran seems to want to jump into the host world, as he has been known to have been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, whose writer and star he is long a member with Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that it will be the show's last, ninth season, and that Kiernan is apparently planning the afterlife of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has not meant anything about the story, although Scottish Sun magazine's sources said that Kiernan wanted to enter into a "mark of important restaurants" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia in the interior expects the courts to re-open their way towards the Pacific
Seamen patrol shipbuilding facilities covering headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
In the bases of ships from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the following motto can be read: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is our duty.'
Throughout Bolivia in the interior, much blood flow 19th-century Chilean coastal conflict still survives - as they continue to sail back in the Pacific Ocean.
These expectations are perhaps now stronger than in recent decades because Bolivia hopes to resolve international courts after five years of deliberation on October 1.
"Bolivia experiences the right moment, with a sense of union and calm, and, of course, it is optimistic about the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the international court's decision through huge screens distributed across the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will give reason to Bolivia's demands - after the negotiation that has lasted decades - Chile has been seen forced to negotiate about giving Bolivia the sovereign path to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charming Bolivian Indigenous President - who is absorbed in the conflict of being re-elected next year - has also made several contributions around Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide on Bolivia's behalf and that as a result, there will be little to change.
The United Nations organization located in the Netherlands has no capacity to give Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide about the results of the negotiations that may exist.
The fact that the International Court's resolution was over six months after the negotiations indicates that the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than encouraging Bolivia's cause, they've been going backwards for the last four years.
"The subject of reaching the sea has been taken as a captive by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarat.
President Morales's belligerent rhetoric has frustrated all his desire to do well remaining in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile have yet to deal with a number of topics, but it will be very difficult to continue discussing them after that.
Both countries have not traded ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, disagrees with those who say that the court's resolution is particularly quick.
On Monday Bolivia said it "will have an excellent opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "to end the 139 years of disagreement, for the good of both."
Calzadilla stated that he disagrees with those who say that Morales - still one of South America's popular presidents - uses the problem of the sea for political support.
"Bolivia will never refuse the right to have a way to reach the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is the opportunity we should have seen to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disorder will not happen until it can believe in the US
North Korean minister, Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not be disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
Ri stated this before the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to fulfill the promise at its peak in Singapore in the face of enemy leaders.
He stated that seeing Mike Pompeo as Singapore's Secretary of State with Kim Jong Un of North Korea for more than three months is at the limit of re-blocking nuclear diplomacy.
Ri says it is "utopia" to think that continued penalties and the objections of the U.S. to the end statement of the Korean War will put North Korea at its feet.
Washington does not want to agree the confession before Pyongyang makes moves to exclude the weapons.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is a lot of skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is serious about the country's only means of securing its safety in appearance — about giving up all weapons.
Pompeo's plan is to go to Pyongyang next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion show in Paris has shown the newest line of massive hats on the High Street road next to you.
If you want to increase your collection of caps or you want to block the sun completely, here's your answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of large sized jewellery hats in the 2019 spring summer collection, which left the style shown in the Week of the Moda in Paris trembling.
Not at all practical hats have arrived on Instagram this summer and those designers have led their impressive designs to the passage.
Valentino's most prominent pieces, with a feather-like beech-colored hat, covered the heads of the models.
Among other additives of great size are a kind of jewel-filled angure, a rather rare hat, and even a kind of pineapple – but they are not a design to warm your head.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks filled with color have lips stuck and appear to belong to Hannibal Lecter rather than to higher tailoring.
One looked like a diver's mask with glasses and a pipe, while another one looked like a melted ice cream cuckoo.
If you are a follower of fashion, you have good news.
Experts in the style say that the deafmen will go out into the street, even to those around you.
Large sized hats come after 'La Bomba', a two-foot wide wing straw hat that we've seen from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski wearing many famous people.
The cult mark behind the hat, which has not been practical at all, succeeded in social networks, has led another object into the passage - the straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model in the bathing suit bearing it.
The Cinderella orange bag, cut in turbid lyse and finished with white leather handle to Jacquemus' La Riviera 2019 Spring-da collection lead in the Week of Moda in Paris.
The stylist of celebrities Luke Armitage said in Féure, "I hope to get the big hats and the big bags for the beach to the main streets next summer, with the great echo that the designer has had it would be difficult to ignore the demand for huge supplements."
John Edward: Basic language capabilities for global citizens
independent schools in Scotland make academic excellence records, and have continued in 2018, with the results of surveys apart, which have been solidified with outstanding individual as well as team results in sports, art, music and other projects of the community.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, those schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, try to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, the career they chose, and as citizens.
As we can design and implement the school's custom curriculum as a sector of education, we have seen that modern languages remain the usual choice chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to anyone in a language that he understands, you will come to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
It is a powerful way of reminding us that we should not use English only to build relationships with people in other countries and to gain confidence in them.
From the results of this year's final examinations we can see that there are languages in the upper part of the most overseas independent schools.
68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have achieved the best A classification.
The data, collected at SCIS' 74 student school, shows that 72 per cent of students achieved the best A classification in Chinese Mandarin; 72 per cent in German; 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This checks that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an inevitable capacity that will certainly be needed by young people and children in the future.
Languages are now cultivated as an axis of teaching (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools as well as others.
A poll of the UK Committee which was made in 2014 found that one of the main reasons found at the time to fill the job was language ignorance.
More and more, knowledge of languages is becoming inevitable for young people to prepare for future limes.
With more job choices that demand languages, these skills are vital in the globalized world.
Whatever career they have chosen, if they have learned the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with the advantage of such a life.
Being able to speak directly to people in foreign countries will automatically put the educating person at the head of the tournament.
According to YouGov's poll to 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak any foreign language in such a way as to have a common conversation, and it rose to a two-digit figure among those who spoke only French, 15 per cent.
That's why it's so important to make investments in teaching languages in children today.
Talking more than one language, mostly those used in economic developments, will give your children more opportunity to find better employment.
In Scotland, schools differ according to the language they teach.
One number of students prefer more classical modern languages, and others look to 2020 as they seem to be important to the US, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of language opportunities for learning in independent school with teachers who are experts in the area.
It is the goal of independent schools in Scotland to prepare children for success in the future in different tasks and provide tools for it.
We can't deny this time, in an international business environment, where languages are vital to the future of the country, so that needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "national communication capabilities."
Independent schools will continue to offer their choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut Monday with the Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James, the primary star, is about to end up waiting for fans to debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has stated that James will play in Monday's pre-period game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't yet determined how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers' reporter Mike Trudell stated on Twitter that James will play with limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked about six-game programming in the Lakers prior to the season.
"I don't need a period game to prepare for at this stage of my career," he replied.
Trumpe's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will give the Rally campaign ballot a start tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of five Rallys for Trumpe's next week, and will visit several places he has friends with, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for the vote that would give him confirmation to fill the square of the Supreme Court, Trump wants to get support or support for elections that will be held in the midterm as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
At what time is Trumpe's today in West Virginia and how can you see him on the Internet?
Trumpe's tour of West Virginia is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. today, September 29, 2018 Saturday.
You will be able to watch Trump's mitina online in West Virginia via the stream of Youtub.
Trump seems to address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to this week's Supreme Court, until the confirmation of the Senate that the situation you are in has been upheld by the FBI investigation for inadequate sexual attitude.
But the main goal of that mitin' tour is to help Republicans win some votes in the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign says the goal of these five mitins next week is to "bring the ballots back and help them hold their majority in the Republican Senate and in the House of Representatives" according to Reuters.
"The Congressional controversially important and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," said Trump's campaign spokesman, who did not allow the Reuters Agency to name him.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, it will allow today's mitina to cover Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and the Pittsburg media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump will visit West Virginia, a state he won by 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Virginia Republicans, who goes after him.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should go there to help with the election," says Simon Header, a policy scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. will try to remain in the individual team Sunday competition
After three attempts on one side, the Saturday afternoon four had what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is the concept of sport invented from top to bottom, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say the time is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think it's now the moment, somehow," said Jordan Spieth, when he made a one-day field.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, the four-pointer, of the twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not going for them, and they need help, mostly Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been completely decisive, from draw to green, and is directing with the pattern.
Those screams of celebrating have been getting louder and louder as the shifts went on, and he has brought the important putt right, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated with another scream like a putta won in the 15th game, which indicates that the American team is not out of the competition.
"You have to look for Indians and only worry about your game," said Spieth.
It's what's left of those players.
18 holes to get out the side.
The only players in the past two days who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the historic Ryder Cup championship players.
The special but charming couples in Europe are four out of four to see if they have failed.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not launch a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they also commissioned bogeys on Friday afternoon and the last nine on Friday.
That shift and the energy that reached the noisy crowd and from it made him a couple to overcome on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina to close Europe's victory when the sun rises at Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both in different holes together.
However, it is early to talk about large Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio García's work, the best of the four, when he was equal to Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles have been placed ahead in the hole that was never too close to defeating the Spanish and Swede.
However, on Sunday, there was no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourteen was fascinated by the close sight of the couples' association, the advice they gave, the advice they did not give, and the way the strategy can change at one point.
Europe played better as a team, and had a remarkable advantage over the final, but the four-way session showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, though some, in particular the Stateside, were questioned.
Europe have gained a 10-6 advantage in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe has drawn a significant advantage in the final of the Ryder Cup, after the Saturday Fours scored 10-6 against the United States of America.
Inspired pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari scored two wins strongly against Tiger Woods, and they scored four valuable points in Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe part-time, trying to regain the lost prize in Hazelin two years ago, reigned in the morning, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance, and won two games, but were unable to overcome the difference.
It took eight points from Jim Furyk's side to hold the award in the 12 individual Sunday divisions.
Fleetwood is the only European Rookie to have won four points in a row and with Molinari, to whom they are called "Molliwood" after an excellent weekend, they are second in winning four points in the four divisions in the history of the Ryder Cup championship.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, he excellently performed the game with the 5th and 4th light over American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, having played two games on Saturday in some way, showed touchdowns of excellence, but lost 19 of 29 games on the spotballs and spotlights, 7 in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning Fourballs and returned with Henrik Stenson in the fours to defeat 2&1 in Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best and third in the world.
Europe did not find its way into the pleasant, fresh day of south-west Paris.
Three-time winning side Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomase set a reference to the Americans, a two-pointer, on Saturday.
They scored a vague 2-1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter on the spotballs and then also passed Poulter and Rory McIlroy after losing two early holes in 4&3 fours.
Only twice in Ryder Cup championship history has a team managed to overcome the four-point side and enter the individual, although Furyk's side only needed a draw to hold the prize.
After being the second best in two days, after the Sunday confrontation, they will be placed ahead of him.
North Korea has given the negative round to leave their weapons without any confidence
North Korea's foreign minister announced to the United Nations on Saturday that penalties continued to inhibit confidence in the United States and that in such a situation, by no means, they will cease to make nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the World organization's Full Year Collector that North Korea had taken "a significant measure of good intentions" last year, to interrupt tests of nuclear weapons and missiles such as leaving places for nuclear tests and promising to stop developing technology and nuclear weapons.
"Although, we don't see a proper response from the US," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security without the U.S.'s trust and, at all events, we cannot leave arms alone first."
Ri repeats North Korean family complaints about Washington's resistance within a "fascinating process" for denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking steps.His statements seem significant in the past seeing that he had not rejected the unilateral denuclearization of Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Une and Donald Trump cite the first summit of the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. Kim then pledged to "denuclearize the Korea Peninsula", and Trump vowed to guarantee North Korean security.
North Korea is seeking a way to bring a formal end to the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States of America has stated that Pyongyang must leave the first weapons.
Washington has ignored the international voices of the Iots demanding relief of the penalties imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. once again says it will have to leave the first weapons and continues to increase the level of pressure of the penalties, towards forcing them to achieve their goal, and it is against the "end of the war statement" that Ri said.
"It is the utopia of those who do not know us to think that we shall be put to their feet by the whips.
The problem is that the continued penalties are increasing disconcerting."
Rike has not mentioned the second summit between Kim et Trump, announced by the leader of the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
The minister, on the other hand, has mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and, he has added, "If the other party were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be blocked."
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be quite different in the past year, where he stated that in the NB Integer Gathering, North Korea were necessarily looking at the U.S. since Trump "Mr. Devil President" called Kim "Mr. missile" on the suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who declared that North Korea would be "threatened", praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to exclude weapons, but stated that it was still necessary to do so and that they would continue with punishment until North Korea was denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he had no time to do so, "even if it's two years, three years, or five months - no matter what."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But, the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, stated before the NB Security Council on Thursday, "It is necessary to continue to strengthen the penalties of the Security Council, without fail, until we verify that its denuclearization is real."
The Security Council has single-mouthedly encouraged North Korea's penalties since 2006 as an attempt to block funding of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo joined Ri outside the NB's Whole Gathering and then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been in North Korea three times this year, but the final trip did not work out.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July by saying that something had been achieved uniquely for North Korea, after it was reported that during the hours this "government demands are made by the Germans."
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon that they would leave the missile places and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures to them."
He told Kim that "the measures pertaining to the people" he was looking for were security guarantees Trump had agreed to in Singapore and had been directing towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken the course of taking enough rest.
This year's school year at Harvard University will have more sleep to undergraduates to try to cope with the growing culture of those who learn to take coffee for overnight.
A professor saw that students at the best university in the world lose their awards in a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and women's hospitals, designed the course, which he believes is the first such in the UK.
He started the course when he gave a speech about the impact of sleep deficiency at the time of study.
"A girl came up to me in the corner and said, 'Why should I do that now alone, in the last year of my school?'"
No one told him how important it is to sleep well, and that surprised me," said the Telegraph.
In school, offered earlier this year, students are explained the effect of proper sleeping habits on studies and sporting results, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of university health services, stated that the university had decided to start the course when students saw that it slept little during the week.
The hour-long course takes several interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom where students press coffee pots, curtains, coaches, and books to see the impact of caffeine and light, and to realize the importance of having too little sleep in sports performance to see the effect and the habit of getting to bed.
In another section, it is revealed to participants that too little sleep can result in heart attack, and that it can increase the risk of depression or cancer.
On a campus map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on their everyday habits.
"We know we're not going to change the students' habits suddenly.
But we think they have the right to know, if you choose to smoke cigarettes, like your right to know the effects that that will have on your health," Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in "nightpass" still exists, he says, and increases the problem of making little o' the increasing pressures that are affected by modern technologies and students.
Sleeping well, with good quality sleep, should be the "secret weapon" to deal with stress, fatigue, and nervousness, he said - even to gain weight because little sleep makes the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology has helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and had one of his first classes in his first year at Harvard.
He stated that the school had opened his eyes and had urged him to join a course that completed campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask graduates to do an equal investigation before entering the competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students place an alarm to determine when to go to bed, and even wake up, and that electronic displays and LED lights issue recognition of the adverse effect of "blue light", which can alter circadian rhythms, and cause problems to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga has passed Gerrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another defeat by Dolly Menga's strikeout set up 1-0 for Steven Gerrard's side at Livingston.
They wanted to win first after winning 4-1 at St. Johnston on the Ibrox side in February, but Gary Holte's team caused Gerrard's team's second defeat in his 18th game as a coach, allowing his eight points to run out of control of the Landbrokes Championship leaders' Hearts.
Menga had gin seven minutes before the break, and Rangers' work did not achieve the draw.
The Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has risen to third and are only behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The problem may have been more serious for Rangers as the Calum Spence wing had to be treated for a head injury because it was hit by an object that was said to have been thrown from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes and managed to reach the semi-finals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livi 11 who took a point off the Hearts in the past week and would be happy to see his well adjusted clothes drown his opponents in each round.
The Rangers dominated the property, but Livingston benefited more from their plays.
Menga's winger Scott Pittmani should have scored the goal kicked through Allan McGregor but the midfielder did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw from Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but only managed to distance his teammate Alan Lithgow to the backpost.
Rangers took control, but in the last third their hope for the game seemed to be greater than belief.
It seemed to Alfredo Morelos that he should have a penalty on the limit of the quarter when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian appeals.
Rangers managed to make just two throws out in the first half, but former Ibrox janitor Liam Kelly had almost no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's head-to-head and Ovie Ejaria's slight hit.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the development of the game, but no one can deny that they deserved to be taken into account at least the great effort.
Once again, the Rangers did not manage to stop Jacobs' balloting against a move.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Gerrard intervened during the break by switching to Coulibaly Ryan Kent, and the change had immediate effect when the winger passed it to Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But the Livingstons continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to increase his advantage, but McGregor held him firmly before making the head-on from Lithgow corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end when he stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson never paid any attention to him again.
Almanac: Geiger counter inventor
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the DENBORA—the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity: after that invention came what is called the Geiger count.
Since then, Geiger count has been a landmark of science, and has also become a landmark of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with seemingly unimaginative scientists Roy Rogers and cowboy Dale Evans leading:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger is count, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these listeners on, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, you hear right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days away from his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new cancer-proof vaccine can teach the immunity system that the evil cell can 'see'
A new cancer-proof vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see' and kill evil cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells within treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and then renting them into the laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-introduced
The test vaccine is giving very good results in patients with cancers of various kinds.
To a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immunity system to recognize evil cells, they managed to disappear from ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and alluding to the laboratory so that a protein that is common to many cancers called HER2 can be "seeed", and then re-introduced cells.
Jay Berezofsky of the United States National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a big future vaccine."
HER2 "brings the growth of multiple types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and onset cancer, Professor Berezofsky explained.
When taking immune cells from patients and how to reach carcinogenic cells a similar approach that consists in "airing" has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye entered a diatribe for West Trump wearing an MAG hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work.
Kanye West was shouted at the studio on a Saturday Night Live when she praised United States President Donald Trump and said she would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak poorly against the Democrats and confirmed his attitude towards Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person they say, 'How do you like Trump, because he's a racist?'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have been away from America a long time ago," he said.
Matt Damon began the session with a pitch in the lead by SNL. In that Sketch, the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in regards to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not irrigated, West's offensive speech was promoted to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear if Rock West was trying to make fun of the publication.
Furthermore, West complained before the public that he had been having a bad time among the wings about his cap.
"I've been attacked between the wings.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a bottom hit place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the place hit?" saying "I'm going to wear my superman's cloak, because that means you can't tell me what I'm going to do, do you want the world to move on?
Try love."
At least a couple of times as a result of his words came whistles from the public and the members of the SNL session seemed to be ashamed, Variety reported, and a person who was present said to the magazine, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend had died a few days earlier, the rapper Rac Miller.
Web surprised many people with the interpretation of the song I Love it, dressed in the same way as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA Conservative group, who published the tweet, "To one of the bravest spirits: THE ESKERIK ASKO MAFIERIA IN THE EGITE".
But as interview show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West simply "was being like him and that's great."
"But I don't want to reward a person who makes an ideology that is harmful to the community by buying his music or clothes or protecting his 'art'."
He's free.
And so are we," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that it is now "the creature whose name was Kanye West so far."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows Diddy's footsteps, as he is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, and how not to mention the late Prince music legend, which changed his name to a symbol and made him the artist Prince who had previously been.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been opposed to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the role of swordsman Jon Snow in Game of Thrones HBO's semi-final fantasy series.
But the 31-year-old actor has been opposed to the stereotype of the machinist hero, stating that due to the appearance of such papers on screen, young boys often feel they must be tough to be respected.
In statements to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said that "something has been done wrong" and asked how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem at the time of #MeToo.
Kit also married Rose Leslie, who is a star in Game of Thrones and also is 31 years old, and admitted that the issue of 'sympathetic' should be dealt with.
"Personally, and with great certainty, I think at this moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, considering the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also have its responsibility in relation to the rise of toxic masculinity, due to the fact that the characters are very masculine.
He continued, "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the streets, that makes young boys feel that they have to do that way of being a man?
I think that's one of the important topics of our time, how can we change that?
It's funny that something's gone wrong for young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make any prior or successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends the following summer, and said that he "moves with battlefields and horses."
From November Kit will appear on Sam Shepard's return to True West.It is the story of a film producer and his brother; his brother is a thief.
The actor recently reported that he believed his wife Rose to have met him is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
"I met my wife during this session, and so she gave me my future family and life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the woman who is loved by Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family settlement in Leslie, Scotland.
GIB/Hiesa: China has reported an increase of 14% in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens with GIB and AIDS.
There are over 820,000 people affected in the country, health authorities have said.
More than 40,000 new cases have been recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are those transmitted by sex, which is a change to the past.
Traditionally, GIB expanded rapidly due to blood-transfusions contaminated in certain areas of China.
But in this way the number of people polluted with the GIB was reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, for years the number of people with GIB and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual GIB transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGTB people is widely expanded.
Due to conservative values in the country, it has been estimated in research that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman.
Many disease transmissions are due to use of inappropriate sexual protections in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to GIB medicine within the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied data from GOP Senators leaked workers, and turned them upside down for 'severe dangerous skulls' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Ord. Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that a member of her staff had published personal information from three Republican U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
Democrats in Los Angeles have stated that the assertions were driven by "ultra-right-wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies, and disdainful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
In the published information appeared information from three U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of allegations of inappropriate sexual reporting against Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate Committee's Supreme Court candidate.
The filtration came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was associated with Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' staff, Hill stated.
"This unscrupulous alleviation is absolutely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"The members of my work group - who have been exposed to personality, personal information and security due to these false fraudulent allegations - have no responsibility in regard to the leakage of that information.
Allegation without foundation is absolutely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement immediately received criticism online from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, for example.
"That denial is made from anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows that it does not have the nature of being a member of Congress.
When they attribute something he hasn't done to someone, he doesn't have to show anger.
He must show no attitude of defiance.
He must not question the reasons of the defendant.
He must appear calm and good-natured.'
Fleischer seemed to want to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, also a republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the legislative's central election, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"If the significant is true," he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said that he had warned his offices to "approve authorities and the entities to execute the law in relation to these fraudulent statements.
"We ensure that it will be known what those who have broken the law are," he continued, "and that they will have to respond before the law in regard to any member of my staff and every act that is harmful and dangerous to all members."
Johnny English Strikes Again movie review - parody of small power spy Rowan Atkinson
It has now become traditional to seek out the meanings of the Brexit in any new film with some British ray, and this seems to be not applicable in the plight of Johnny English action comedy. it began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
What kind of rubbish do we show about the matter by satire of ourselves will we get a new export opportunity for our nation?
In any case, Johnny English, who has big outcast eyes and a rubber face, has renewed his license to fuck things up for the second time: his name shows above all things that he is only a wide-ranging comic creation designed for the lands that see non-English cinema.
He is, of course, a silly secret agent with a little resemblance to Clouseu despite his particular desire to get the complimentary Glamour, and also a ray of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the boy who helps Chariots of Fire with a single note in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In Barclaycard's television commercials that we have already forgotten, Atkinson interpreted it is also naturally based on the mysterious passenger and international man, leaving chaos behind.
There's a major moment or two on this last JE ride.
I loved the way Johnny English approached the helicopter with a middle-aged armor and the miller's crosses hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is seen on the screen, but the mood lacks strength and is too superfluo, especially when even "serious" movie prints like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy among their components.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English-en the absurd adventures are not as clever and clever as the Bean character jokes in Atkinson's silent films.
The constant topical premises is now that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has been infiltrated into Britain's super-scientist spy web network, exposing the personalities of all British agents working, and is upset about the agent in service. Unfortunately the small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is excessive for a Prime Minister whose character is pontoon and persecuted, who is already completely losing political fame: Emma Thompson seems the best with the character who is almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help too much.
His intelligence advisers inform him that just as all active spying has been compromised he will have to recover someone in retirement.
And that means that Johnny English is walking the way he can.He's now a teacher in an elegant place, but he's giving confidential lessons about acting as a secret operating person: a few beautiful jokes there, because English offers a kind of ‘School of Rock' spying academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting, and is reunited again with Bough, who had been his first partner. again Ben Miller interprets that character.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander – Vicki Pepperdine is lost slightly to that role in the style of a baby fortune.
So in Your Excellency's Secret Service, we've got Batman and Robin back in action to make things miserable, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by the technology billionaire who says he can solve Britain's informal fatalities. Jason Volta is the malicious one, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their fatalities: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant.They create chaos by secretly entering Volta's luxury yacht, and English excites complete anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality helmets to go and see what Volta's house is like from the inside.
All stops are done looking at that final sequence, but despite being nice and funny, it's all got a lot from children's television.
That's how it is.
And as with Johnny English's other films, this has come to my mind: can't Rowan Atkinson give the British film industry a role worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are preparing a plan to work in a four-day week but collect five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that predicts the British to work on a week of friends a day but collect five days.
It seems that the party wants the employers of the enterprise to give the workers what they saved through the revolution of artificial intelligence, giving them one more holiday.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but still take home the same salary.
Sources have stated that the idea 'enters well' on the party's economic agenda and wants to put the country on the workers' side.
Passing to the week of four days has received support from the Congress of Syndicates as a way to profit from workers to the economy that is changing.
A Labour Party high has stated to The Sunday Times, "It is anticipated to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen from day to day, but the week of four days coincides with the party's view of bugging the economy for the worker, and the party's general industry strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the party that sponsors such an idea, as the Greens Party defended the four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
Nonetheless, the aspiration has not yet received the support of the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party voter has stated, "The four-day work week is not the party's policy, and the party does not appreciate that."
Minister John McDonnell, who is in the shadow, used the Congress made by the Labour Party last week to determine his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell certainly said that ‘unfaced directors' and 'experiors' should be deprived of power in the companies that provided public services.
On the shadow minister's planet, also, current shareholders of the water company may not receive their full membership if a Labour government sees that there has been a misguided behavior that the removals could be done.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to include workers in enterprise directors and create Inclusive Property funds to donate 10% of private sector companies' capital to employees, which could collect year-round dividends of between 500 £.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion or not
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his appointment to the Supreme Court at least one week, and has placed doubt on the table as to whether the consequences of the investigation could lead to any republican senator removing his protection.
In an interview posted on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of "60 Minutes", asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could draw anything that could alter their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open than his party partner in South Carolina.
"I think I do," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the argument has been revealed, I said, "Did you do that?"
He replied with an air of envy, without doubt.
Graham's votes, however, appear to be written on stone.
"I have decided as far as Brett Kavanaugh would be concerned and he would also suffer from the prosecution that would cause an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he talks about could not verify that.
He's 36.
I see nothing new has changed.'
What is the Festival of Global Citizen and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday at Global Citizen's Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event that brings about enormous artists and has a huge mission to prevent the poverty of the world.
With the seventeenth edition this time, the Festival of Global Citizen will bring thousands of people to the Great Course in Central Park not just to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the actual purpose of the event, i.e. to curb extreme poverty before the year 2030.
The Festival of Global Citizen, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. This project is an international promotional group that expects poverty to increase by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free entry for the occasion (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP tiket), those who wish to attend the concert must perform various tasks or "actions", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or making a call in some other way that serves to help increase awareness of the purpose of destroying poverty.
But what success has he achieved when he has 12 years left to Global Citizen to fulfill his goal?
Is the idea of encouraging people to take action through a free concert, or is it just another case of what is called "clicktivism", that is to make people feel they are making a real change by signing an online petition or sending them a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its followers, with pressure to serve various purposes.
He says these actions have led world leaders to announce policies and commitments of more than $37 billion, and these policies and commitments will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people before the year 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and predictions derived from actions, and at least $10 billion of them have already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the supported funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investmentmakers and implementers who have a commitment to "help children develop their full potential", which is home to the United Kingdom." He has promised to donate $35 million to Rwanda to destroy malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 chicos from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments, and members of the Global Citizen like you we will make the social injustice of denouncing pass into history," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman in public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
Additionally, the group has said that after more than 5,000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project. by that project 5 million women and children will be assisted by interventions related to nutrition.
In response to this FAQ questions they have on the website, "what makes you think we can destroy extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements against civil rights and apartheid before us, we too will succeed, for we are stronger together.
They will be Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe, among others, at this year's event shows in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will present the event.
U.S. could use the Army to slow down Russian energy exports as a "block" - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could use its Army to avoid Russian energy reaching markets, including in the Middle East, has been reported by U.S. interior secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has stated that Russia's relationship with Syria - as it is notable, since it is operating there on demand by the legitimate government - is only an excuse to browse new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he has stated, according to the information.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to handle it.
"The United States, with our Army, has the ability to make sure that the lines of the sea are open, and, if necessary, even to block them, to make sure their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants of an event organized by the Alliance of Energy for Consumers, which is to say to participants of an event organized by a group of non-profits who present themselves as the "Voice of the Energy of Consumers" in the United States.
Washington compared his approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, explaining that they are equal after all.
"The economic choice we have in regard to Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one resource economy" with dependence on fossil fuels.
Trump's administration to promote the export of its liquidated natural gas to Europe and the possibility that Russia, i.e., is much cheaper for European consumers, has come when it has been on a mission to replace them.
For this purpose, officials from the Trump administration, and US President Donald Trump himself, attempting to convince Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 gasway project, which the project makes Moscow's "gatibu" in terms of Berlin Trump.
Moscow has insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gasway of $11 million, which will double the existing gasway capacity to the 110 billion metre cube, is only an economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's passionate opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons, and is an example of dishonest competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a pressure-making tool and consumers should be able to choose providers," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s position has had a negative reception from Germany, and has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries, has asked the U.S. not to enter the US's energy policy and the two-way agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after a recent meeting.
Elizabeth Warren will "sakon examine" presenting herself as presidential candidate in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "sacrely examine" presenting the presidential candidate after the mid-term legislative election.
Warren confirmed that while he was in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, he would examine the introduction.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and repair our broken government, which requires a woman upstairs, he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll look deeply into presenting the presidential candidate."
Warren gave an opinion on Donald Trump at the City Hall, stating that he was "still taking the country the wrong way".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has spoken openly when criticizing Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren said, "Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
Nonetheless, a poll published on Thursday has shown that most of Warren's constituents do not believe he should run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight per cent of Massachusetts' "testable" constituents said that the senator should not run for president, according to the poll by the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/The Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent were favored by the introduction.
According to the poll there is more protection in the chances of presenting former Governor Deval Patrick, who has been protected by 38 per cent as a possible presentation and 48 per cent have been opposed.
Other names revealed as of a potential 2020 presentation include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cited the stress disorder after Track Palin's trauma during Donald Trump's election coverage.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after entering September.
He was arrested and charged on Monday night for domestic violence.
"For what my son is suffering from, for what he is suffering from when he is returned, I feel identified with the effects of stress disorder after trauma and the other families suffering from the vulnerableities that our welds bring back," he told the public of an election act for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the arrest was "a remarkable matter" and said of his son and other war veterans "they come back with something changed, they come back tough, the other soldiers with members and members of the air force and all the other members of the army asking if there is that respect for what they have given the country."

18 states, D.C. protect the impact of new asyllous policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia Distribution are protecting the law-enforcement to a new policy of the U.S. that denies the assillus to victims who are fleeing from flags or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and dissertation issued a friendly statement Friday to support an asyllator in Washington, defaming police, NBC News reported.
It has not been made known against federal policy the full name of the suspect of Grace v. Sessions, introduced by the American Union for Civil Freedoms in August.
He said that his partner "and members of his violent gang" had caused sexual abuse, but U.S. officials denied him an asylon request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers of the state who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which creates a large number of U.S. asyllators because they are countries with many widespread problems with flags and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asyllous policy revoked a decision made by the Committee on Appeals of Immigrants that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to request assiliation.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday, "the new police ignores the state, federation, and international law of the years."
"The federal law says that all asyllous requests should be allocated based on particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar violates that principle," the amicus curiae statement reported.
Additionally, lawyers argued that the policy that denies immigrates access to writing harms the U.S. economy, who are more likely to become activists and provide "a necessary hand of work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give more asyllos in June to victims who were fleeing violence from domestic violence and flags.
"Assilence is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear of being a member of a race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion when they leave their country," said Sessions when it introduced policy on June 11.
Assillus has never been in itself to solve all the problems that people experience every day, despite the serious problems.
Attempts to make a desperate rescue in Palu, while the number of dead has doubled, in the race to find the survivors.
For the survivors, the situation grew more and more serious.
"It feels a lot of tension," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who had fever while calming her baby son in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Death brings ambulances every minute.
Clear water is missing."
The inhabitants have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking their belongings from the water, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 earthquake, are flooded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with her back and shoulder broken, were laid to rest outside the Palu Army Hospital. The patients were treated outside due to constant repressions.
Tears fell from his eyes, telling how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake when he was in the hotel bedroom with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I crushed against the remnants of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard the wife beg for help, and then the silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they'll be good."
The U.S. ambassador has accused China of "threatening" with propaganda advisors.
After an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement that encouraged mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China in an ABE newspaper, the U.S. ambassador has accused Beijing of using the American press to expand its propaganda.
President Donald Trump of America quoted the additional paid in the second paper most widely sold by the Chinese newspaper in Des Moines Register, Iowa state last Wednesday, after he accused China of attempting to enter the U.S. Congressional Election on November 6, China denies the allegation.
The fact that the accused was trying to enter the Beijing U.S. election has been marked by Trump's remarks to Reuters by U.S. officials; it was a recent campaign in Washington that was rising to pressure China.
Though it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a rising trade war, during which war each country has placed spurs on the imports of the other.
China's retaliatory advocacy, at the beginning of the trade war, was supported by Trump's Republican Party intended to attack exports in Iowa-like states, as stated by China and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime Governor of Iowa, that is, one of the state's most exported agricultural goods to China, has stated that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad has stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now strengthening the attack by putting propaganda announcements in our free press."
"Dispersing the propaganda, it is making use of the strong tradition for American free press and press freedom by putting Chinese government paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"From the point of view, in the press citation right here on the Beijing street, there is little dissident voice and there is no real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people can have in regard to China's conflicting economic career, since the media depends on the firm control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
So he added that "one of China's most popular newspapers avoided an offer to publish his article," but did not say what newspaper it was.
Republicans reject female voters ahead of legislative midterm elections with Kavanaugh's debate, analysts warn
As many high-ranking Republicans are in attendance and Brett Kavanaugh is defending his candidate for Supreme Court in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will have a decline, particularly among women, in the next legislative midterm election.
The emotions surrounding this subject have been very large, and most Republicans are registered by showing that they want to continue with the bottling.
In these accounts it cannot be withdrawn," Grant Reeher, professor of the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in regards to an article published on Saturday.
Reeher has said he has doubts about whether the pressure that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) could support an FBI investigation will be enough to calm voters who are angry.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday — they won't forget it tomorrow, and not even November," said senior consultant Karine Jean-Pierre and national spokeswoman for the Progressive MovementOn group, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouting "There's a November!" were protesting before the Senate that republicans controlling the Judicial Committee had decided to go on with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford being there, stated in Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motive will be out of place," independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say they've been very influenced by food; that's true.
But it could still be more effective, particularly among women and young people in the suburbs who do not have a fixed vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that even if they often do not like the president, they do not vote."
Even before public testimony was made detailing Ford's sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested it could be a downfall if republicans decided to go on with confirmation.
"It has become a big deal for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The question is not whether or not the vote of the committee, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh should sit in the chair of the defendants, it is also a matter of how republicans have handled this subject and how they have treated the woman," explained the news channel's chairman of the group that helps select Democrat Guy Cecil "Priories USA."
Nonetheless, the Americans seem to be quite divided between the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh at the time of deciding which of them they believe, but more people seem to favor the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of those involved were likely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% were sure or probably Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% have said that they believed that Kavanaugh has probably or probably lied in his declaration, and 30% have said the same thing about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, has reported that The Guardian.
Last week he declared before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Ford, Kavanaugh had attacked him while he was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed him geniuses were at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The one who invented the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented World Wide Web, wants to set up a startup aimed at confronting Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid's free software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt being "taken over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data repository" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, calendar, music storage, and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify: they're all available in one browser, and all at once.
The characteristic of online personal data storage is that it is entirely left to the user who can access information of a particular type.
The company calls it "the possibility of people by data".
According to Executive Director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put resources, processes, and appropriate abilities to help make Solid useful to all of us.
Currently these are the ones that make up the company: Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to ""Facebook and Google about the need to make a complete change when their business models change completely from day to day.
"We're not asking for permission from them."
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to put together an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid and commercial energy."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed when he founded the Internet World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influenceful voice in discussion of the network's neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt's departure, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm quite an optimist on the Internet as far as this next time," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The cleric has been honored with the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only cleric of the Church of England who has received the Victoria Cross as a warrior of the First World War has been honored, in his country, 100 years later.
Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew that he had received the highest British award of military honor.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandchildren at a defiile in Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone was given to his grandfather to be rewarded and displayed 100 later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion by crossing the Channel of Saint-Quentin that "the fog was very closed and under constant fire from guns and machine guns."
Then he went quickly to the first line of fire, and with the utmost courage he drove the line forward until he found a cannon alone and threw three of the detachment to the ground.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that he knew that his grandfather's actions "could never be done by him, but that gives great humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, established a flower crown after the parade.The parade was led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the protection that many people will give him."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig was put on them instead.
Suppose you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 full of people, and then they won't let you see the main show.
The sign at San Jose contained 13 fights, six in the main calendar, and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the United Kingdom audience was shocked when the covering was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised to fight deliberately until the small hours of the morning.
One tracker described it as "a bad taste joke" on Twitter a change to children's cartoons.
"A government law says that content was not appropriate by 6:00 a.m., and they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, chief vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the show.
"'Peppa pig, yes'".
Bellator company chairman Scott Coker said they will examine the programming to consider viewers in the United Kingdom in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think we can probably fix it," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't fix that until it's Sunday in our hour, Monday in their hour.
But we're working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going on and on and on, and not all of them were very nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to put on five fights instead of six, like we usually do, so we tried to offer more to people, and we fucked up.
Unfortunately it's a situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'disappointed' in regards to sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling underestimated over sex compared to others, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said that it was not until he went to secondary school that he realized that "they weren't all like him."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she had spoken to others about "serious expectations" about homosexual rights.
In addition, he said that being a parent led to less importance in winning Olympic games.
The regular host of the long-running program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months' vacation for the disease.
After appearing completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "decided" compared to everyone else because society was not allowed to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feelings that make you feel underestimated and different from others have been the real reasons that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" because, in his own words, he didn't want people to be disappointed when they knew about his sexuality.
The sportsman who has won two bronze medals in Olympic games has become a high-profile LGTB promoter, and used the participation of the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries deplete homosexuality.
He said that because he felt that he had given his opinion he was very lucky that he could live in an open way without suffering any consequences and that he wanted to give "serious hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that he had fallen in love with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "sorryly captured."
Daley married the winner of the rainbow 20 years older than him last year, but said age inequality has not been a problem among them.
He said that "when you're so young and so many things happen to you" - he went to Olympic games for the first time at the age of 14 and that his father died with cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through similar incidents.
The couple became the parents of their son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley has said that his "full vision has changed".
"If you had asked me about last year, 'I have to win a gold medal' was the only thing I had in mind," he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than gold medals in Olympic games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert. he died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with mental cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and that one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't say 'you won't be in a position to be on the first line, Dad,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't accept it until he stopped breathing and died that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The next day Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic games, and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: to put it before the local public in Olympic games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song choice - Proud, of Heather Small, which made him feel identified throughout the entire process of preparing for Olympic games and still putting chicken-wielding on him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was not in form, remained in the chair at Saturday's Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make a record on Sunday when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to improve his form not to look bad.
Mickelson was breaking the mark by playing 12th time in the event every two years; however, he was sent to the chair by Captain Jim Fury in Saturday's furball and spotlight fashions.
Instead of being at the center of action, as he has often been for the United States, he who has been the top five-time champion split the day to be a cheerleader on one side and on the other to play the game on the field, hoping to correct what makes him suffer.
He was never the most direct of the drivers, nor at the best of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best choice for the competitive dynamics of Le Golf National, which are dominated by the toughest players who are lost.
And even if the field itself doesn't scare enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game, on Sunday, will have to face British Open champion Francesco Molina, who has joined the Tommy Fleetwood Rookie to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, starting 12 individual games under four points, have a good start, Mickelson's game could be entirely crucial.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, who could not say much more.
"He understood very well the role he had for today, gave me a little punch on the back, and he told me he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a sportsman at the tip and has given these teams tremendously in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was hoping for more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we felt we should act.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record as the player who played the most games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may be the end of the Ryder Cup professional career that has never reached its individual mark again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stopped seven times in between, however, according to Furyk, he has brought something intangible to the team.
"It makes him laugh, and he's sarcastic and intelligent, and he's usually joking with people, and it's great to have his presence," he declared.
"Young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to see him.
He does a lot more than play."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that the great advantage they have may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows with experience that despite having a great advantage in the final day's individual round, the Ryder Cup tournament can easily become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, Valderraman had his Danish debut, where his team had a five-point advantage over Seve Ballesteros against the Americans, but they won the tournament closely with a score of 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a great advantage over Valderra and barely won, and that we lost to Brookline even though it was a great advantage," said Bjorn (in the photo), after winning Class 5 and 3 of 2018 on Friday and yesterday, having a 10 and 6 advantage over Le Golf National Field.
So history tells us both me and all the teammates that this hasn't been over yet.
We're going to act with all our courage tomorrow.
We'll go out on the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are on the clipboard.
We aim to win the Trophy, and focus on it.
As I have always said, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know well what's on the opposite side: one of the best players in the world."
Dissatisfied with the achievements his players have made on a difficult golf field, Bjorn has also said, "I never want to advance anything.
Tomorrow.
It's the turn of individuals tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a member when things go well, but, when you're alone, every golf player has to prove his full ability.
That's exactly the message you've got to transmit to the players: the best you've got out tomorrow.
Now, forget your comrades, for they too must draw their best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team is confident that his players will play better than individually as members, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Fury himself has been in the form on both sides of these last day's directional changes, as a member of the winning team at Brookline, and later lost against the European team when the Europeans performed the so-called "Medina miracle".
"I remember all the words I said," he said, when we asked Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, how he encouraged the players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the very beginning, like Brooklinen and Medinan.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We've decided on that list of players, and we're hoping we'll do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has a job of counter-attacking, and will have Rory McIlroy in the final match of the enemy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the upper middle order.
"I have chosen that team in that order because they are in a position to make the whole way," Bjorn has said of the selected individuals.
The construction of the new German warship has been delayed again.
The new German marina frigate had to be requested in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but will not be built until at least next year because of defective systems and increasing costs, local media say.
The request for the battleship called "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the main vessel of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, who has mentioned a military spokesman.
The ship had to enter the marina in 2014, but eleven issues after delivery have prevented it from being able to complete this project of great ambition.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class requested by the Marina in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It seems likely to have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and ship missile features, and technology for carrying out hidden actions (e.g., restricted radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
Additionally, it will also have longer maintenance capabilities: the newest frigates may be up to two years away from their original ports.
However, due to constant delays, these warships with point technology (which Germany aims to project its power) will be out of date by the time they enter service, says the newspaper Die Zeit.
F125 frigates that have finished badly make a lot of noise out of yours in the media last year, as the German army officially rejected the vessel's request, and returned to the Blohm & Voss fleet in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the marina had returned a ship to the shipyard after she had delivered it.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media cited serious "software and hardware flaws"; as a result of them, the warship would be unusable if it were to be used in combat missions.
They were particularly important in software misconduct, the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be operated by 120 sailors, i.e. half of them in Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship has too much weight and as a result its performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult to add novelty to the marinas in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" vessel weighs double the similar-class vessels used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project (including manipulation training) is also the problem.
It is reported to have reached £3,100 million, from £2,200 which should initially cost them.
The problems with new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that German marinas power is being reduced.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the "useful ships" of the Marine are being exhausted.
The representative has said that the problem has increased further because no replacement has been given after the old ships were withdrawn.
He complained that even a Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate had not entered the marina.
The Secret Life of Bats has been observed by the National Trust
A new study has been conducted on a land in the mountains of Scotland to find out how bats use the landscape to search for nutrition.
They are hoping to get more information about the behavior of these special flying mammals so that they can better determine the activities of protecting them in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) will be tracked by common and soprano dwarf bats, and by large ear and Daubenton bats, in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at essential locations, and will be tracked by the bats' activities throughout the season.
Workers in the United Kingdom's healthcare system (NHS) will also make mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts perform sound analysis of all recorders, the frequency of bat calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Subsequently, there will be a map and report of the habitat to obtain a sculpted landscape scale image of bat behavior.
In the opinion of Rob Deware, an advisor to nature protection in the NTS, it will be determined what are the most important areas of bat habitat, as well as how each species uses them.
Thanks to this information, the advantages of the work of treating the habitat will be determined; for example, the creation of meadows, and how to best maintain forests for bats and species related to them.
The bat population in Scotland as well as throughout the United Kingdom declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects nests and lose their habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also lead to danger, including fly capture papers, chemical treatments in construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, as they hunt in the night, their ears are more useful to them than their eyes, at the moment when they take prey.
They use a sophisticated positioning technique by means of chickens to observe the bugs and obstacles on the flight path.
The NTS organization is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of Scotland, and takes the bats very seriously.
He has ten experts who regularly make observations, studies of nests, and sometimes rescues.
In fact, the organization has created a bat-reservation first and only in Scotland on the Threave land of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of bat live in Scotland.
According to David Thompson, manager of the estate, the land is perfect for them.
"We have an excellent setting for Threav's bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, and many years of trees; it is very suitable for habitat.
However, many things are still unknown about bats, so by the work we do here and on other grounds, we will understand what they need to be healthy."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check whether there are bats before maintenance work on the onibars; for if only one maternity nest was accidentally destroyed, 400 female bats and young can be killed, and possibly the entire local population might thus disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, pursue, or disturb them, as well as to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, who represents the bat protection organization, has asked the general population for help.
He said: We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us.'
Ronaldo has dismissed allegations of rape while his lawyers rush to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the allegations of rape against him are "false" and that those who have done it use his name only "to get the publicity".
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published the accusation.
Portuguese and Juventus frontman Kathryn Mayorga has been accused of raping an American woman in Las Vegas in 2009.
This was followed by allegedly paying him $375,000 in exchange for keeping the event secret, as Der Spiegel stated on Friday.
Just hours after the indictment was released, he has made a live video on Instagram for 142 million followers of Ronaldo on the platform aged 33, where he has said the allegations are "false".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What I said today is fake news," said footballer who won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
"They want to gain publicity by making use of my name.
It's normal.
They want to get a reputation by saying my name, but that usually happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they say are "an unacceptable publication on suspicion that affects privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will claim compensation "as it comes to the anguish of the violation, which is one of the gravest violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event occurred in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped him from the sludge, documents from the Clark County trial court in Nevada say.
Mayorga has stated that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident, and said that he was "a good man in 99 per cent" but that he failed "in one percent".
The documents say that the couple confessed to having sex, but that the relationship was allowed.
Mayorga has also said that he appealed to the police, and that he took photographs of his injuries at the hospital, but later reached an agreement outside the courthouse because he was "seriously frightened by retaliation" and "was concerned about being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman has said that she wants to reverse the deal because it remains traumatized because of the alleged incident.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer went to Italy's big Juve team due to an agreement of £100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will forever regret" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will "be forever sorry" to cease to head car manufacturers after the "Brexit", business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He has also said that it is "excellent" that the Toyota UK company has told the BBC that if the United Kingdom exits the European Union without agreement, it will halt its factory production in Burnaston (about Derby).
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
Japan's car manufacturer has said that delays that would be in the ads due to a "Brexit" without agreement could lead to a loss of jobs.
The Burnaston Factory (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the United Kingdom exits the European Union without agreement at the end of March, the production of our factory will be stopped," said the administrator director of Toyota, Marvin Cook of Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also stated that they fear because they do not know how trade between borders will work if they come out of the European Union without agreement.
BMW, for instance, has said that it will close its Mini Factory for a month after the "Brexit".
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks surrounding the supply chain if the "Brexit" is realized without agreement.
Toyota's production line is "current" and the pieces arrive once every 37 minutes, both from providers of the United Kingdom and the European Union, for cars created as requested.
If the United Kingdom exits the European Union without agreement on 29 March, interrupts could occur within borders and, as a result, delays and lack of pieces.
It would not be possible for Toyota to retain more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire factory; as a result, production should be stopped.
In Clark's words, Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations of the European Union "is measured to avoid these adult examinations."
"It's necessary to have a deal, we want the best deal, not just to secure the current success, but also to make use of this opportunity in the future," he said on the BBC Radio 4 network Today programme.
"Other manufacturers besides Toyota have demonstrated that it is vital that very successful supply chains remain in their own."
Toyota has been unable to state how long production will be stopped, but, in the long run, because of additional costs, the competitiveness of the factory would be reduced and consequently warned that jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is coordinator of Unite's union factory, has said that the members are increasingly concerned, "I'm saying that if we lose these jobs, we won't get them back.
A government spokesman has said, "We have presented a detailed and convincing plan for future relations with the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may have been postponed again, according to the White House
The important meeting between Donald Trump and the general prosecutor replacement Rod Rosenstein could be "another week delayed" while the conflict surrounding the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh goes on, the White House has said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, the influence of Russia on the U.S. elections, the connection between Trump's supporters and Russia, and Mueller is investigating the alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
They have been talking about whether Trump will fire the general substitute prosecutor and consequently risk Mueller's independence in the last few months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times has reported that Rosenstein considered carrying a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from the post following Article 25 of the US constitution.
Rosenstein cancelled the information.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while information was released that he would resign.
Instead, he stated that he would have a meeting with Trump at the moment at the United Nations headquarters in New York on Thursday.
Trump has said he prefers not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting has subsequently been postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate judicial power committee; on that committee, Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexually assaulting him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, tested.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, whereby the Senate vote has been further delayed.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "No date has yet been set; it may have been this week, but I would understand it being postponed in another week, with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
However, we shall see; I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may not be very in agreement with that statement: for Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace has asked him the reason for that.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences has not been due to the fact that television reporters are "serious", but said, "I agree they're grandiose."
He has subsequently suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President makes far more attempts at questions responses than his predecessors," he said, and added that without mentioning the evidence, "We have checked those statistics."
Sanders has said that they will continue to hold press conferences, but that "if the president of the United States has the opportunity to ask questions directly, that's much better than asking me.
We try to do that many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times in recent weeks, and that'll replace the press conference when we allow ourselves to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House when he participates in open sessions, or press conferences that are made when visiting dignataries.
He doesn't usually do press conferences on his own.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the President of the United States this week in New York when he made a spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered there.
The secretariat in the health department of the united kingdom has written a letter to the European Union employees working on the NHS system in Scotland on concerns about the "Brexit"
The health department secretariat has written to European Union employees working in Scotland's NHS health system to thank them for the entire country, and to ask them to stop there after the "Brexit".
The letter has been written that less than six months remain to draw the United Kingdom out of the European Union by the Scottish parliamentarian Jeane Freeman.
The Scottish government has already agreed to take over the cost of requests from citizens of the European Union who work in public services because it is "a state of population" ("settled status").
This is what Freeman has said in his letter, "During the summer, negotiations on the 'Brexit' have progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and is expected to achieve some resolution by autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has increased preparations for a possible untreated exit.
I know it's a very disturbing time for you all.
That's why I want to confirm that I very much consider the contribution of each employee, whatever his nationality.
European union colleagues, as well as those outside it, bring useful experiences and abilities, and improve the work of health service, for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we hope to live to stay with us."
They have operated emergencyly after Christion Abercrombie suffered a head injury
The linebacker of the Christion Abercrombie Tennessee State Tigers has been operated emergencyly after suffering a head injury on Saturday after losing 31 and 27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tenness has reported.
In the words of head coach Rod Reed of the Tennessee State team, the player has suffered a head wound a little before the middle rest of the game.
"He's been diving to the band on the side and fainting," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personals have provided oxygen in the band itself to Abercrombie, and taken him on a bedding for a deeper medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team has told Chris Harris of the WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee, that he has gone out of operation and is in the Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris has said that "they have not yet given details about the type of wound or its anguish," and are trying to determine when the wound occurred in the Tennessee State team.
He is in his second year with the red-shirted Abercrombies, and has his first season in the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles before leaving the game on Saturday that he has made a total of 18 total tackles for the rest of the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the timbre when they buy goodies in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the timbre when they buy goodies in the United Kingdom, and this additional amount will be used to help those who have been left homeless, following the plans of the Conservative party.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
For those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom there will be an increase in tax on the timbre
In the opinion of the Public Treasure, they will collect a further £120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the timbre when they buy goodies in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to help those who have been left homeless by how much additional, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters; Corbyn has pledged to provide housing with reasonable prices and collect more taxes from those with the most income.
It will be for people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom the increase in taxation on the tyre, and will be used for efforts by the government to reduce people who sleep on the street by how much additional they have collected.
The overload, which is an addition to the tax on the current timbre (including high taxes for the second houses included and the onibars purchased for rent two years ago), can reach up to three per cent.
In the opinion of the Public Treasure, they will collect a further 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the onibars built in London are purchased by those who do not live in the United Kingdom; as a result, prices rise and it is more difficult for those who want to buy for the first time to enter the housing market.
The rich areas of the country, especially those of the capital, have become "mumu villages"; in fact, foreign buyers usually spend most of their time outside the city.
It comes just after Boris Johnson's request to reduce the tax on the tyre to help young people buy their first apartment, this new policy.
He has charged large construction companies with keeping the prices of goods high by buying and unused land, and asked May to set aside a reasonable priced housing fee in order to resolve the "life crisis" in Britain.
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced some attractive reforms about housing; including rental control and "unreasonable" homelessness.
In addition, it wants to give municipalities more powers to build more housing.
May has said, "I said last year that I would devote my British presidential dream to first, to improving the life of every new generation, that is.
That means repairing the rotten housing market.
Britain's gates will always be open to those who want to live, work, and organize life there.
However, it is not fair to buy housing for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for British residents who work hard for foreign companies.
For too many people, the dream of owning an apartment has gone too far, and the dignity of those who have to sleep in the street is still here.'
Jack Ross: "To be coach of the team of Scotland is my greatest wish"
Head of Jack Ross Sunderland says his "greatest passion" to be coach of the Scotland team sometime.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which is third place in League One, three points from first place.
This summer he came to the stadium as Stadium of Light after the St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to act as a player for my country.
I won a B League trophy, and that was all," Ross has said on the BBC Scotland Sportssound programme.
"But since I was a kid, I used to watch the games in Scotland with my father in Hampden, and I've always wanted to go back.
However, if I had the ability to manage the club, I would only have the chance.'
Among those who had coached at Sunderland before Ross, are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss has said that he did not feel nervous about coming after such big names, for he had previously refused offers to coach the Barnsley and Ipswich Town teams.
"To measure the fish, I'll have to ask myself, 'Can I return the club to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of the club, he should certainly be in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful if I don't succeed in doing so."
Ross has only been serving as a coach for three years, as Dumbarton's principal's assistant at one time and one of Hearts' training staff after 15 months.
Then he helped Alloa to recover after going down to third grade, and even thanks to her, he went on to become champion from being on the verge of stepping down St Mirren the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton were in the Academical Group.
"It was a real crossing for me, maybe," he said about taking charge of Alloa.
"I really thought being a coach was the best function for me, rather than being a player.
It's funny to say that; for I was a good player, I used to make a living well, and I lived some important fashions of fame.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much you have to deal with every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of the job, but I'm pleased as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and, now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever."

The top five-and-a-half on Saturday is the best time for a drink, according to a poll
Thanks to the summer heat ballot, revenue from Britain's pubs has been greatly raised, but pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bar chains have risen by 2.7 per cent, but of restaurants down by 4.8 per cent, the data says.
Peter Martin, who works on CGA business advice that has collected the data, says, "As the sun has struck steadily, and England's team has remained more than expected in the World Football tournament, the data of July is similar to those of June, where pubs' income has risen 2.8 per cent, but those of restaurants have dropped even further.
Although restaurants' June sales have dropped 1.8, they have been even worse in July.
pubs and bars that specialize in drinks have had much better performance, and their rise has been greater than the downturn of restaurant sales.
pubs that specialize in food have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to have a drink.
Sales of pubs and bars drinks have risen by 6.6 per cent in the past month, and those of food, however, have dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hosting analyst at the RSM company, has said, "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and social events and sports are the most important factors in trade sales outside the house.
No wonder restaurant chains have financial embarrassments, and the downfall of 4.8 per cent of sales will result in important damage, in addition to continued pressures around the cost.
Long and hot to summer comes at a perfect time for establishments specializing in food, and it is to be seen if moderate temperatures in August will give them relief."
The increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including those of newly opened establishments, has been 2.7 per cent in July, with chain expansion slowed.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index oversees sector sales in regard to pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, with 47 operator teams' performance data collected and analysed. these teams of operators, together, have revenues of more than £9 billion.Indice is considered the sector reference point.
Of the five children, one has accounts that are hidden from their parents on social networks
One of the five children (some as young as 11) have accounts they hide from parents and teachers on social networks, according to one poll
In a poll to 20,000 students in secondary school, "false Instagram accounts" could be seen as rising
Because of this news, the fear of how sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty per cent of students say they have a "nearly" account that their parents can see.
But one of the five children (some as young as 11) have accounts they hide from adults on social networks.
In a poll to 20,000 students in secondary school, "false Instagram accounts" could be seen to have been raised greatly (the photo sharing website is Instagram).
Because of this news, the fear of whether the sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty per cent of students say they have a clean "nearly" account that their parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
One mother accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website where one teenager would "buy me" to others. "
As illustrated by this study by Digital Awareness UK of the United Kingdom and the "Directors' Conference of independent schools" (HMC), 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them acknowledge that they have private accounts.
In the words of head Mike Buchanan of HMC, "It's disturbing that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athlete's spokesperson" at the Scottish athletics committee
He has been appointed ex-executive director of the Scottish athletics committee Eilidh Doyle at the general assembly this year of the administration.
Doyle is the most prized athlete in Scotland, and manager Ian Beattie has said that with this change, they have an excellent opportunity for those who address the sport to make use of the vast experience that he had in the nation in the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the United Kingdom, and around the world, and we know that it will be very useful for Scotland's athletics to be on the committee," said Beattie.
Doyle has said, "I like to be an athlete's spokesperson, and I hope I will make a great contribution, and lead the sport in Scotland."
The American won both the 200 and 400 metres races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and has four gold medals in total.He is a BBC announcer.He recently lost his ability to walk because of a transient ischemic infarction.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had an infatuation.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was to see whether I would recover or not, or to what degree.
I had to learn to walk again, and to-day I've been doing business.
Thank you for the messages you sent me to give me courage!"
An advertisement for a milkgate comparing mothers to cows has created contrasting opinions on the Internet
A milkgate company has created contrasting opinions on the Internet compared to cows milked by the breast donor.
In order to make the introduction of what is said to be "the world's first silent milk-door laptop", the Elvis company working technology for consumers has released a joke advertisement inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom that the new device gives to mothers who draw milk.
Four women who are really mothers dance in a stable full of straw, with a song containing these words and the like: "Yeah, I milk myself, but I don't stick to it," and "Maybe you didn't notice, but these aren't the crematories, they're my boobs."
This [is] the motto: "Take out milk, bring milk, give milk to the little ones, bring milk out, draw milk, I'm milking my girls."
However, this announcement, which the company has posted on its Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 visits and hundreds of comments, the video has produced a variety of reactions in viewers, many have said that it does not take the "seriousness" of the milk industry seriously.
"It has been a very bad decision to use cows to make advertising of this product.
Like us, they too must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their young are robbed only a few days after birth," said a user.
Elvise can enter a milking orsing bra discreetly (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else has said, "Very traumatic, of course, for mom and baby.
But, well, why don't you use it to make some kind of milk-door advertising for mothers who don't take the kids away from them?"
He added, "This story has no kindness at all."
Others, however, have defended the ad. One woman has confessed that it seemed "like a laugh."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still breastfeed, I'd buy one.
When I drew milk I felt like I was a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but that's his point.
It's a great product," a user wrote.
This has been commented by another: "It's fun, aimed at mothers who draw milk (they often have to do it in workplaces or in the bathroom), who feel like they're 'beaks'."
He has no intention of praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have been dancing with milk on their chests.
It is considered that many women who draw milk feel as if they were cows during the campaign.
Elvis's milking is completely silent, though, and he has no cable or pipe. He can be carried discreetly in an orbiting bra, so that women can move as they please, be children in arms, or go out into the street.
Ana Balarin Mother, a partner and executive creative director, has commented, "Elvie is a highly revolutionary product of milking, and therefore demanded a bold and challenging presentation.
With this equality between women and milk-bees who draw milk, we wanted to highlight the process of milking and all its challenges, and also express in a friendly and near manner the freedom given by milk-dooring.
It's not the first time Elvis' milkgate has attracted attention.
During the fashion week in London, a mother with two children appeared in passing for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of silent emigrant children have been taken to a campground on the Texas border.
The number of emigrant children in the aftermath has increased greatly in recent times, although they are more or less the same care per month on the border; one of the reasons for this is that it has been more difficult to carry children to protectors because of Trump's hard rhetoric and guidelines of stewardship.
So far, the paperless immigrants have themselves been most of the protectorates, but now they are afraid to name to protect the children, because they could lose their power to stay in the US.
The risk increased in June; in fact, federal authorities said that those who wanted to be protectors and other adults living in their homes would have to send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authority.
Last week, Matthew Albence, one of the officers of immigration and advocacy security in the U.S., testified before the Congress that dozens of people who petitioned to protect minors who arrived without an adult were arrested.
That agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of them had no penal precedent.
"Almost 80 per cent of those who live with them are illegally in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still catching them," said Albence.
In order to process the condition of the children more quickly, the officers have created new rules; according to them, they must appear in court within a month after they have seized the children, and not after 60 days as before, in terms of shelter workers.
Many of them will appear in a video conference call to request legal status from an immigration judge.
If it is determined that they are not fit to receive assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The more time the children spend in care centers, the more there is a chance for them to increase their anxiety and depression; as a result, violence rages or attempts to escape could occur, according to shelter workers and reports that have been made in the system in recent months.
Children's defenders say that these concerns increase in large facilities such as Tornillo; for it is so great that there is more probability of ignoring children's problems.
They also said that if children are taken to the camp camp to prepare emotionally or without time to say goodbye to their friends, the trauma they already have can be increased.
Syria has asked the "occupier forces" of the U.S., France and Turkey to come out immediately.
In the United Nations General Assembly, the foreign affairs minister Walid al-Moualem has also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Prime Minister's replacement, has said that foreign forces are illegally in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated "in the form of dragoon".
"They must get out of the land at once and without any condition," he said on the committee.
Moualem has said that the war on "terrorism in Syria is almost over"; 360,000 people have died in that war since 2011, and millions of people have been forced to leave their homes.
He has said Damascus will continue to "fight in the sacred battle" until "we clear all parts of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "legitimately foreign presences".
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France, on the other hand, has 1,000 troops on the land of the country which has been destroyed by war.
As for the subject of the refugees, Moualem has said that there are appropriate conditions for them to return, and has attributed it to some "Western countries" about spreading the "serious irrational horror" that encourages refugees to stop outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns," he said.
"They're policing what's just humanitarian stuff."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that no aid in rebuilding Syria will be provided until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Most recently, Russia and Turkey have made an agreement to create a defensive zone in the last stronghold of the rebels in Idlib; in the opinion of United Nations diplomats, there is an opportunity to promote political dialogue thanks to it.
A large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia in that province with three million inhabitants was avoided by this agreement between Russia and Turkey.
However, Moualem has said that the agreement has clear "limit day" agreements, and stated that military action will target Yihadists, including Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaeda, who will "deuse"
The Secretary of the United Nations, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be held between the members of the government and opposition to begin forming a constitution following the war, as well as to begin opening the way for elections.
Moualem has established conditions for the Syrian government to participate in that assembly, saying that the work of the assembly must be restricted to "revisiting the articles of the current constitution", and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why Trump will win for the second time
Following this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if (as many Democratic party viewers probably expected) a detention process or scandals do not end his presidential run before he needs it.
That would be the most dramatic ending of a presidency!
For now, the audience doesn't seem tired.
Since 2014, viewership on the CNN network of the majority schedule has nearly doubled until it has reached 1.05 million viewers, and tripled the MSNBC network to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers on that schedule, meaning that 1.7 million has risen from four years ago, according to Nielsen's company data.The show on MSNBC network The Rachel Maddow Show has the largest viewership on cable television, and has achieved up to 3.5 million viewers on the nights that important news has happened.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what's going on," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC network's "Designated Survivor." After the Capitol is destroyed by an attack, Baer's session is about a cabinet chief who becomes president.
An experienced comedy-guitarist and "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," ("Only funny shoes: a hard truth about entering Hollywood multilens club") by Nell Scovell has another theory.
Prior to the 2016 election, while in a taxi in Boston,
the driver told Trump he would vote.
Scovell asked him why.
"Because it made him laugh," said Scovell.
There is also time for entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, like nothing else on television, stories coming from Washington can bring the future of abortion law, families of immigrants together again, and decide the health of worldwide economics.
Only high-privileged viewers have the option to disconnect.
However, he goes beyond being informed that if you spend six hours watching a debate of experts on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward has used "serious premieres" to write the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostre cover jacket ("a costume full of debris" in The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels' funny way of describing Trump's "anatomy".
At least I won't look at Super Mario again in the same way.
Wheelhouse Entertainment's executive director and founder of the show "Pawn Stars" Brent Montgomery says this to the changing characters and arguments of Trump's show (to argue with the national futbol league, to praise Kim Jong-un) about: "It gives a sense of being a 'Reality show' because it gives you something to consume every day."
You can't lose any parts, or you'll stay behind.
When I met with Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees tall and was sunny at his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was stuck inside the house watching MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not disseminate from television, particularly now, that Brett Kavanaugh must appear before the committee of judicial power in the Senate, and that the future of the Supreme Court hangs.
"When I used to do these funny teleplays, people used to say it was the end of Western civilization," Fleisse told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but apparently they were right."

Outdoor money is being barred in the United States Congress's half-matched legislative elections.
It is not surprising to know that money is entering the bar during Pennsylvania's 17th dissertation; for Congressional dissertations have been reorganized, and as a result, two headlines are being contested for the same chair.
The boundaries have represented Conor Lamb of the Democrat party in that dissertation around Pittsburg that has recently been reorganized, who got their chair in a special election from another dissertation.
Another headline is that of rival Lamb, Keith Rothfus of the Republican Party, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th dissertation, which is significantly retaliated with the 17th dissertation.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court determined that the boundaries of the distractions were mandated against what the constitution says in favor of the Republicans. As a result of this ruling, the boundaries of the maps were properly delineated.
This 17th new dissertation contest has resulted in a close contest for campaign finance on major party funding sources: the Democratic campaign's congressional committee (DCCC) and the Republican campaign's national committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania for little he won in March the 18th Congressional-distributional special election in Pennsylvania.
The chair was owned by a Republican in the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the dissertation with a 20-point advantage in addition.
In terms of political statements, Democrats have some advantage.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador for being on China's side, but then backfired the decision
Diplomacylists have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already considered Beijing, Washington has barely asked them to back down.
Trump had a polite meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to throw out the Trump organisation management team.
Officials of the state department decided to take the American heads of diplomatic missions out of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, following "the new decisions to stop considering Taiwan", as department spokesman Heather Nauert said in an early month's statement.
However, the penalties were considered only to be made against El Salvador, who received $140 million from the United States as aid in 2017, including to control nautical traffic, promote development, and help the economy.
Among the proposed penalties are the reduction and specific visa restrictions of economic aid, which would be extremely damaging for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officers delayed a high-level conference around security and economic prosperity, aimed to have the vein followed by a similar meeting last year, and was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officers of the administration made it clear that they wanted to make the conference, and thus issued a statement that the consideration for setting penalties on El Salvador had been dropped.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to participate in the conference which has changed in mid October, a sign of the importance of the administration to the meeting, in the words of diplomats.
The three American couriers have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no messages or severe punishment from Washinton.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House has denied making a statement about the details given by three American officers about the dispute, among the officers were two diplomats who have agreed to report internal disputes in exchange for retaining anonymity.
An analyst who is closely related to the administration and has also spoken anonymously has confirmed what they said.

The report of Attorney General Robert Mueller will soon be released, which will indicate whether Trump interfered with justice; in fact, there is much evidence of this in the public viewpoint.
In addition, Mueller is also said to have been investigating whether he had been a friend of Trump's campaign in Russia's attack on the U.S. election.
If the majority of Congress is changed by party, Trump will have to give him instructions, as he prepares to appear again before voters (and, if necessary, sometime a jury of his equals).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I don't mean Trump's inevitable decline del, or Trump's most European equivalent.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and it will be determined by them how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, German officers were willing to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western countries had supported him and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years that followed.
It is with such points of inflection that we have history which causes the accidental progress of democracy to be accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are currently facing a number of such inflection points.
What are we going to do if Trump fires general prosecutor replacement Rod Rosenstein, Roseinsten, who controls what will happen with Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been in jeopardy since this newspaper reported last year that it suggested that the president be secretly recorded, and that he declared that the president was inappropriate for his office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times stated is wrong.
"How do we respond if the investigation that has just been asked to the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he receives confirmation to be a Supreme Court judge, although there have been credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony against him?
And above all, will we vote in a way that will form a Congress that will claim responsibility to Trump in the mid-legal elections?
If we don't pass those tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers feels optimistic about Rapid Vienna's confrontation with
Rapid will be Vienna's host on Rangers Thursday, who know that if they defeat the Austrians, after their exciting draw with Villarreal in Spain a few weeks ago, they will be left in perfect position to qualify for the Europa League G team.
Due to an injury suffered on his knee by midfielder Graham Dorrans, he was unable to make his first appearance of the season until the 2nd and 2nd draw with Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use that as a trapper for better things.
"It was a good affair, because it's a good enemy Villarreal ," the 31-year-old player has said.
"We played in order to get something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have won by the end, but it's a fair draw, if need be.
In the first half, they prevailed, and in the second, we reigned.
Thursday night will be very important for the European tournament.
We hope to score three points, but it will be difficult, because they had a good result in the final game — yet the audience is on our side, and I am confident that we will go ahead and achieve a positive result.
Last year was difficult; I had injury and changes were made at the club itself, but there is a positive atmosphere at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it a lot; training is also good.
I hope we will go on, forget about the previous season, and succeed."
Women are extremely concerned about a problem involving savings for their retirement
The members of the poll knew what kind of care they want to have, but very few have informed their family members.
Half of those involved in Nationwide's investigation have said he has spoken to his partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked about it with his children.
"We want some family member to wait for us, but we don't dare ask," explained Holly Snyder, the vice president of the Nationwide insurance company.
Here's the first step.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: the family won't be willing to take care of you if you don't ask him to do so first.
Act in association with an advisor and family to agree on where and how you want to receive care; for the cost of care will depend on these opportunities.
Ask an advisor for help: a consultant can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You have more than one chance to fund long-term care, including: routine long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay care expenses in cash, and insurance that can be paid for with your own money at the moment if you have that money.
Clean up legal documents: forget about legal conflicts.
Choose a trusted person to take care of your health care; likewise make sure that you will be looked after as you wish if you are unable to be asked by professionals.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a trusted person in your name to make financial choices and, when you are unable to do so, make sure you pay the bills.
Don't forget the details: let your parents know they're old and one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications or allergies?
Write those details so you can be prepared in a written plan.
"Finances are at stake, but what are the doctors?" Martin asked.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed on Friday by the strong earthquake and tsunami that the city of Palu in Indonesia suffered, and, agents say, the number of dead will rise.
As communication systems are cut, field agents have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala government; this is the closest area to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Palu.
Palun, over 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here is the important information about the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi and the Donggala government:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that comprises more than 300 miles (180 miles) of area that forms the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The government, which is an administrative ward under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but Morowalin is mostly concentrated on the coast beyond Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian table of handling disasters (Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management), Paluk and Donggala have experienced many tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed, and hundreds of homes were destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
Also in 1996, another tsunami occurred on the west side of Donggala, and nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area called the "Pacific fire belt"; for this reason, it often experiences earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake occurred on the western coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami.This tsunami shook 14 countries, and caused 226,000 deaths on the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in southern Java (the island with the most inhabitants in Indonesia), and caused a tsunami.This tsunami severely shook the southern coast, and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of southern Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in one of the Mentawai islands near Sumtra, and caused a tsunami of at most 10 meters. as a result of this, dozens of villages were destroyed, and about 300 people were killed.

Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested with domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, who is eligible to serve as Alaska's former governor and vice president, has been arrested with assault charges.
Palin, 29, and born in Wasilla, Alaska, for being suspected of a domestic violence case, was arrested for obstructing allegations of domestic violence and opposing authority, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers Division.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman began calling the police to prosecute the alleged crime, Palin took his phone off her.
According to KTUU, Mat-Su is at the Pretrial Facility Center in Palin, in preventive confinement and on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was alleging he said that he was "no doubt, innocent", as the network had given him to know.
Palin has been charged with three light A-level crimes, and a maximum of one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a light B-level felony with one day's imprisonment and a possible penalty with a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin is charged with some crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was accused of assaulting him.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to prosecute the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, obstructing allegations of domestic violence, and having a weapon by being drunk.
Her girlfriend stated that she had given him an extreme.
When the son's aggressive attitude was associated with the disorder of post-traumatic stress caused by the experience in Iraq, Sarah Palin received strong criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have been killed on Friday after an earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake created a tsunami, and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications games are suspended, and the number of dead are expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Several videos that show the moment of impact on social networks revolve around.
In fact, because of a beach festival in the city of Palu, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami shook the coast.
The federal prosecutor wants a special death sentence for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
The New York federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of the terrorist attack on New York City that eight people died; the last time such a punishment was imposed for a federal crime in the state was in 1953.
Supposedly, 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental truck for his attack on the redevelopment of West Side Highway Avenue in Southern Manhattan; during this October attack, he had previously carried all foot and bikers.
To reason for the death verdict, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov killed those eight people "willfully" and fatally injured several people, according to the death penalty intentional notice presented in the Southern District of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible in both cases to impose the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury charged Saipov with 22 cases, including eight counts of murder for organized crime, which is commonly used by the federal prosecution in cases of organized crime, and a charge of motor vehicle violence and destruction.
The prosecutor said the attack should have been "prepared and planned" because Saipov "cruded" it; he described it.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov's actions caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intentional note.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last time the Southern District of New York sued a death penalty case.
The accused Khalid Barnes was then charged with the murder of two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York was in 1953, then Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were assigned to whom they were charged with conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union two years prior during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbekistan Saipov did not show any algae in the days and months following the attack.
Police said that he had stated to investigators that he did not feel bad about what he had done.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told authorities that inspiration for the attack had been seen on his cell phone by footage of the ISIS organization.
Also, in the words of the police, he asked that the ISIS should be placed on the flag of the organization in the hospital room.
As of the 22nd felony charge, he has declared himself innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for representing Saipov, said that they have taken "a major detention" with the prosecution's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence for life imprisonment without a chance of release will only prolong trauma to people who have experienced the impact of these incidents," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to call for a death sentence.
A member of the Conservative Party parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of the negotiations surrounding the Brexit
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize people's army" today in protest at the Conservative party's conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party has said that politicians should feel "hot" of the eurosceptics, and Theresa May's parliamentarians have proposed it to take care of the negotiations with the US.
As Conservative parliamentarian Peter Bone has explained to participants in the Birmingham march, the United Kingdom "would have been out" if Mr Farage was already the secretary of the Brexit.
But the Conservatives for staying have organized a protest against the Brexit in the city, and highlight the challenge of Mrs. May's presence: to reconcil the fully distributed lines.
The Prime Minister is trying to make Chequers continue their plans for the engagement, but is involved in supporting supporters of the Brexit, supporters of staying, and the US attacks.
The Allies believe that he will go on and try to reach an agreement with Brussels apart from such reactions, and that he will force the eurosceptics and farmers to decide between his or her offer or "caosa".
Mr. Bone explained to the participants of the Leave Means Leave march that was performed in Solihull, he wants to "shoot Chequers".
He also stated that he should collaborate with Mr. Farage and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was armed, we'd already be out," he said.
The Wellingborough Party's parliamentarian added, "I will defend the Brexit, but we must fire Chequers."
Indicating his opposition to the US, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws, in our own country."
Mr Bone rejected the fact that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "It's just a lie that the British have changed their ideas and want to stay."
Andrea Jenkyns, who is a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of the Brexit, also went to the march, and explained to the correspondents, "I have only this: Lady Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers are not popular among citizens, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular among our party members, nor among our activists who shake the streets and make us possible to win the election.
Let Chequers out and start listening".
Addressing Mrs May, she added, "The prime ministers, to continue to have work, must keep their word.
As Mr Farage told those involved in the march, politicians must be forced to feel "hot" if they are going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of confidence between us (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray the Brexit, and we're here today so they know we won't let them out with theirs."
Addressing the public full of enthusiasm, he added, "I want you to feel the heat to our political class about betraying the Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of citizens who gave us victory in the Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying marched through Birmingham before a two-hour march in the center of the city.
A few activists raised signs against the Brexit after this weekend's group meeting.
Adonis londa, who has a peasant membership, ridiculed the Conservatives for their security concerns with the party's application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can get them to work properly, and the whole technology of Canada plus plus chain in Ireland, of no fricative limit, of free trade without limit," he added.
"It's a great lie.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren will examine the possibility of being a presidential candidate with "great access".
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "arrestly" the possibility of running for president after the November election.
As The Boston Globe has been given to know, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at the full gathering that was completed on Saturday at the western Massachusetts City Hall.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican Party's state representative; Diehl was the vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is said that Trump may have taken Trump's place in 2020.
The event at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting with its members since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if he intended to be president.
Warren replied that there was time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and for this purpose a woman must be in charge."
A suspect has been arrested for the shooting that caused the death of Sims at Louisiana State University
Police in Baton Rouge, Luisiana, reported on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect on Friday for the shooting that caused the death of basketball player Wayde Sims at Louisiana State University.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported at the news conference that was made at 11:00 p.m. (eastern time) the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson .
Before that, he opened video of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying a man who appeared in it.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on Friday morning near the southern university campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, and as a result he eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul explained to the Saturday newspaper through the 247sports network.
Wayde got involved in a conflict trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been there, held a gun in his hand and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken to prison without incident to the police department of the parish of Baton Rouge in the east.
He grew up in the nearly two-foot Sims Baton Rouge, played 32 games of 10 stars in the final season, and averaged 17.4 minutes of play, 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per game.
Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton achieved the world title thanks to team orders after winning Sebastian Vettel
It became clear to Valtte on Saturday that since Bottas was ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes team's orders would be killed or live in the race.
From the start, Bottas performed well, and nearly threw Hamilton out of the street to defend his place in the first two, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the boxes, and Hamilton had to get into the traffic at the end of the deck, which should have had a direct effect on the race.
The Mercedes went into the boxes a little later, and followed Vettel out of it, but after a fight Hamilton got ahead of him, for the driver of the Ferrari had let him go after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 on that day, started the race in the final row of the departure park, and finished the first round in seventh place.
Next, he remained in first place for much of the race, and, by the end, held the pneumatics to finish the race quickly and to advance to Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxes on the 44th round, but was unable to live the pace in the remaining eight two, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and he's really been honest.
The group has done a great job in the venture," said Hamilton.
Those were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein during a demonstration held on Saturday that the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had not been leaked by the same letter.
When he spoke at a demonstration held in West Virginia, the President made no direct reference to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate shows people being "bad, false and lying".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate in the last few days, that you see anger, that you see people who are angry, that you see people that are mean, false, and lying," he said.
"You see the plaintiffs and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember his answer? Did you leak the letter?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we haven't leaked it," he added, imitating the Senator's reaction.
The letter explaining the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh went to Feinstein in July, and has leaked last September, but Feinstein has denied the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's alleviation; I have not leaked his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, as The Hill newspaper has given it to know.
"He asked me to keep it quiet, and I kept it secret, as he had asked."
But the fact that he denied it was not welcome on the President's side, who stated during the march held on Saturday night, "I'll tell you: these were inappropriate gestures.
It may not have been that, but it was the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen."
Following the defense of the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of inappropriate sexual attitude by three women, the president stated that Democrats are using alleges for their purposes.
"They are willing to do anything to restore power.
They're bad guys, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president, who the Mediaite site has given to know.

An air controller has been killed by hundreds of passengers on a plane to escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after being assured and killed that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers should take off properly.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Numerous strong replications have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and left Mutian Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport control tower.
In turn, it remained there to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight was properly off the air, which was currently on track.
Next, he jumped out of the control tower when he saw he was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said, thanks to this decision, hundreds of lives were saved, as the Australian ABC News site has given to know.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear that," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death rate will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesian table to manage disasters says that access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The tasa is still supposed to grow, as many bodies are still under debris, and we have been unable to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Table.
At most six feet of waves have completely destroyed Palu; there will be mass burial there on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, the 35-year-old mother explained to the Sky News site, "Minuturo, an ambulance full of corpses arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all food from small markets."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, has explained to the CNN chain: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as fast as possible to help survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
Tragedy is already this, but it could be a lot worse."
Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday, and explained to the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" gave the CNN chain to know.
Indonesia has also been shaken by another earthquake this year; this occurred in the city of Lombok, and more than 550 people died.
Micronesian aircraft crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crash that occurred in a lake
The airline that operated the flight that fell into a lake in the Micronesian Pacific now states that a man is missing after 47 passengers and crew said the plane that was sinking was properly evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a publication that he could not make sure a male passenger was missing until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is interacting with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to journalists who asked for more details (such as age or nationality) about the passenger.
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to rescue them as they were about to land at Chuuk Island Airport after the plane fell into the water.
The agents said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. army have said that the plane fell into the lake next to the track.
Some testimonials speculated that the aircraft had passed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"That's a terrible good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers easily reached the emergency temperatures of the sinking plane in the water that reached their waists.
He said that the cabbages were scared and rioting, and that he had suffered a minor wound to the head.
The U.S. army said that the assistance of fishermen who were working around the pier's improvements was also very helpful in rescue work, for which a pulp boat was used to carry passengers to the ground before the plane sank 30 feet (100 feet) into the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none have been due to Air Niugini.
An Analyst has completed the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday in the new trial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
As presented to the jury, mobile phone records were used by 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers to link their movements on the night the woman died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phone shows that she was with Tellis Chambers the evening she died, thus contradicting Tellis' previous assertion, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
Data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers's just as Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford; the police then turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in the country that day.
When the prosecutor asked him if Tellis had said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "serious" because "the truck was in Nashville."
There was another moniker, Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks ago.
According to mobile phone records, however, they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from the phone.
"He erased it from life," Hale said.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the latest abductions.
The judge has said that the trial will pass through the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a conscious hip-hop?
A trio who make hip-hop music want to challenge people with negative opinion about the type of music, and for that purpose they will fill their music with positive messages.
The Bristol High Breed says hip-hop music has set aside political messages from its beginnings and the struggle for social issues.
They want to go back to her roots, and get her conscious hip-hop to be known again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen the revival of such hip-hop in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another nigger?
A New York kindergarten accused a couple of dismissing him after a "racist message"
A New York kindergarten has accused a couple of discriminating him and dismissing him because of a mistake he wasn't for him and said he was "another black" after receiving a message from his mother."
The couple have denied that he is racist, stating that the accusation is "too much."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised when the new employee who would take care of the children, Giselle Maurice, discovered that she was black, arrived home in her first day in 2016.
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, when he noticed the mistake, he was said to have felt "deserved" in Plasco-Flaxman, and fired Miss Maurice, the previous kindergarten, who was African-American, saying that she had not been a good worker and instead hoped for a Filipino nurse.
She paid Miss Maurice for that one day's work, and asked for a Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice has sued the couple, and asked him for compensation for the damage caused by the dismissal, including $350 for six months of the day; for although he was unconstitutional, he was initially hired to live and care for it at home for six months.
"I want to show them that such things aren't done," he explained to the Post newspaper on Friday, and added, "I know it's discriminatory."
The couple has denied that he is racist, and said that it was reasonable and necessary to dismiss Maurice because he feared they would not be able to trust him after he had insulted him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco explained to the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
No way."
In explaining that the prosecution was "not for this purpose", Plasco said that his wife had had the child less than two months ago and that she was "in a difficult position".
"Will you be looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investment banker.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the court of public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, punishing them for its attitude and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid that the readers would like a bear that talks, as a new letter has shown
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter, "It's hard to put her in the place of someone who first read it before the book was published.
It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's great success now."
Father was a cameraman on the BBC network thanks to a small toy bear before he was inspirational for writing the children's book; his daughter said that his father had an optimistic attitude for people rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "sweet taste", as he died last year.
As for Paddington, he claims to have been "an important member of the family", and that his father was proud of his success in the end.
"He was a silent man, and he was not vain," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he almost made him feel like he was some kind of child who gets something: you feel proud of him, even though it's not your achievement in itself.
In my opinion, this is exactly how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the creation of her and her imagination, she always acknowledged the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to greet her on the phone.
As soon as he was buried, his daughter was quickly taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but doctors could do nothing to save his life.
"Nad regularly called to say it was very serious, he didn't think it would go out," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell him that he would die for the next two minutes and I had to say hello to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medics that the doctors had given him to keep his heart beating were gradually exhausting and leaving his system.
He died a little earlier than he thought, and it was all over.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that everything would start there.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold him."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had since been disappointed by her daughter's death, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgotten the grief she felt.
"No one knew," he said.
"My head was bent, and my tears were down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Some upset women have posted signs on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost the people they loved as a result of the suicide want to avoid getting rid of themselves by more people.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed signs on a bridge in Wales; these signs contain optimistic messages and phone numbers so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began having depression problems, and killed herself when she was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney; she said her son had a special gift for cooking, and had an infectious smile.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up anywhere."
But he left his job before he died, because it was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his life off himself.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am worried that there will be any domino effects."
Mrs. Davis created a series of posters, "for people to know that there are people you can tell and who can help you, even if they're a friend.
Do not be silent; you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have long been friends, and she was also her partner for 15 years shortly after the death of her mother who lost Mark.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his attitude.
He was heartbroken on Christmas Day; when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to go on: "He leaves a moment in his family.
It makes us sick.
But we must all go on, and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is shaken after the FBI investigation begins
"I thought, if we could get something like what he asked for, such as a limited-time or limited-range investigation, maybe we could get a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, and added that he feared that the Committee was "participating" in the face of the unrest caused by enthusiastic party supporters.
Why didn't they want the FBI to investigate the case for Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican followers?
The contrary opinion is because of time.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections, which will be on November 6. In them republicans are expected to get bad results, and if so, they will begin the race of leaving the man they want to be elected to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has made numerous phone calls to the Senators, and has put pressure on Mr. Kavanaugh to support them; for Mr. Kavanaugh's work for Mr. Bush in the White House, through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI filed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit at this point.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if he did, Vice President Mike Pence could break the draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives in North Korea has been "down" since Kim is in power
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Combined Department, said that there had been 1,127 fugitives last year compared to 2,706 fugitives who had been in 2011.
Mr Park said the strengthening of the restrictions between North Korea and China and the establishment of larger fines on person traffickers has been severely affected.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
Nearly every fugitive in North Korea is offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China; it has the longest boundary with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the demilitarized area between the two Kores with severe protection measures (DMZ).
China considers fugitives as illegal Imigrants, and not as refugees, and often forcibly residing.
North Korea and South Korea are still naturally at war, with two of them having improved significantly in recent months.
Early in the month, leaders from both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on the denuclearization that were stopped.
Earlier in June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to the Korean nuclear-free peninsula.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, who is the Minister of External Affairs of North Korea, accused the U.S. of failing to make any progress since then.
"If we don't have any confidence in the U.S., we won't even have confidence in our national security, and, things like that, we won't leave our weapons first," Mr Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly held in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has told Brett Kavanaugh that she is "hysterical", and that she is not prepared to be on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minorities in the Chamber, has told Brett Kavanaugh that she is "hysterical" to the candidate for the Supreme Court, and that she is not willing to be on the Supreme Court as far as genius is concerned.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview that was held on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have told you that she is "hysterical," Pelosi said; that was her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied being sexually assaulted by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and at times he would almost scream and toss when talking about his family and his youth.
He also explicitly accused Democrats of the Committee, and said that the allegations against him are an "organized and offensive statement" organized by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton for having lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has a sympathetic opinion against Democrats.
"With these assertions and his attitude against the Clintons and Democrats, he has been out of the league," he said.
Pelosi objected if Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats gained a majority in the Chamber of Representatives when asked if he would oppose it.
"This is what I'm going to say: if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not ready to be on the Supreme Court or be on the court that's right now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a Judge of the Court for Appeals of the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanaugh will oppose the law for available health care or Roe v. Wade, who applies conservative justice.
In the confirmation court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would back certain Supreme Court decisions.
"A stubborn and stubborn person cannot go to court and hope that we will take him well," said Pelosi.
And women must command.
It's a fair speech; a terrible rage of months and years, and he can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do I?"
She continued: "A woman who was a local executive helped me tremendously, and told me that she also cried when she was angry, but developed a technique: when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her, 'I'm talking to her, you can think I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Tears aren't badly seen to express rage, partly because they are misinterpreted.
I clearly remember something that happened to me in one of my first jobs. Most of them were men in an office, where I was crying with rage once, and a more mature woman grabbed me by the neck.
"Don't ever let him see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understood you."
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democrat member of the Colorado Assembly, and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential races.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business and discovered that he had a love affair with another woman than his wife and refused to race, Miss Schroeder, heartbroken, decided to be the same presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well-planned decision," he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called them "Edurne White and the seven gnomes."
As the campaign had begun long ago, he was chasing the money, so he decided he wouldn't enter the race until he collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He noted that some of the followers who donated $1,000 to the men only gave us $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked himself.
When he delivered a speech and announced that he would not campaign an official campaign, he was deeply moved: he supported people's gratitude, money, and voters instead of representatives made it so difficult for him to gather frustration with the system, and his anger at sexist attitudes – he finally spoke to them tottel.
"You must have thought I was very excited," Miss Schroeder explained as to the reaction that the press had seen her attitude.
"You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Did she cry?"
The benefit of commercial wars between the US and China could be brought to Beijing
The saves that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the U.S. and China were buzzy, and although there is a vital conflict, the crackdown between the countries may have led to Beijing benefit in the long run, experts say.
The first warning was dropped by U.S. President Donald Trump early in the year; he then imposed a tax on China's major export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase has come this week, as new tariffs will apply to products worth $200 billion (150 billion francs) to half the goods that will be transported from China to the US.
Beijing has applied retaliation for things at a time, and the latest has been to raise tariffs between five and ten per cent to American merchandise worth $60 billion.
China has said it will equal each U.S. ascent, and the world's second strongest economy will not change its easily blink in the opinion.
Asking Washington to step back would lead to him going on trial, but publicly surrendering to the U.S. would be more embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing did well, pressures for commercial warfare in the U.S. could benefit China in the long run, which would undermine the dependence between the two economies.
"A quick decision by Washington's or Beijing's politicians would create conditions for economic lattice in some of the two countries—that's more dangerous than observers thought before," said researcher Abigail Grace, who investigates Asia in the U.S.'s New Security Center along with several other experts.
Syria is "prest" for refugees to return, the Minister of External Affairs has said
Syria says it is ready to return refugees who wish to voluntarily return, and it is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by the long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of External Affairs Walid al-Moualem said the situation of the country is improving.
"Today the local situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the process against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to resurrect the areas destroyed by terrorists so that they can return to normal as quickly as possible.
Now, it is a convenient situation for refugees who want to voluntarily return to the country that they had to leave because of the economic measures that made terrorism and their daily lives and maintenance difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government will be greatly grateful for the help of rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he noted that he will not accept the support of the countries that supported conditional aid or the rebels.
Europe has received the Ryder Cup cup victory held in Paris
With 16.5 points on the final marker after defeating the U.S. team with 10.5 points, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup cup which has been held in Paris, France, at the outside Le Golf National.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won a Ryder Cup cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again carried the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson spent nearly a bad time in the entire tournament, and threw the exit blow into the water at the 16th hole in part 3, so he passed the witness to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Milinari was largely noted in all rounds, and since the start of the championship's current format in 1979 he became one of four players who ever achieved results of 5, 0 and 0.
The American Jordan Spieth achieved 5 and 4 results and was out against the worst player in the European team: the Dane of Thorbjorn Oles.
Dustin Johnson, who is the best player in the world, achieved results 2 and 1 against the kingdom-owned Ian Poulter, and reached the final of the Ryder Cup cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, part of eight Ryder Cup cups, became the top European winner of the championship with 25.5 race points.
"Normally I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So he thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy, in fact, to get my cup back.
This is teamwork, and I'm glad I could help," said García, moved, after Europe's victory.
He has passed the witness to the Spaniard John Ram, who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods (2 and 1) in the Sunday individual game.
"I feel very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 results in the Ryder Cup cup.
Strange statistics for one of the best players ever to have been, who have won 14 major titles, just over Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend badly looking for a solution to it, except for players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, said of the team's bad game, "I'm proud of my boys; they've tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work out.
[to Thomas] Good for you.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll meet again, I'll be working with the PGA and the Board for the Ryder Cup, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm so proud to be their captain.
We must admit defeat.
We're out."
