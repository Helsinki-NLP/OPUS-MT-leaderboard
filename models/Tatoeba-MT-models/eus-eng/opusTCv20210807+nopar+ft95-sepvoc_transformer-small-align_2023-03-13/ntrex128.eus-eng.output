Members of the Welsh assembly have expressed their concerns because they will "take them as puppets"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed grief after hearing the suggestion of changing their office name as MWP (the Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This idea has arisen after developing plans to rename the Welsh Legislative Assembly.
Members of the political assembly are concerned that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A member of the Labour Party in the Assembly has said, "In English, that new name rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
If you are out of Wales: in Wales, twp means "noo" and pwp means "kaka".
For his part, a member of the Scottish Assembly has said that the whole group is "not very happy" and suggested searching for replacement names.
Also, a member of the Conservative Party of Wales has said that it is "open" to new ideas to change the name, but he has also expressed his concerns for rhymes that can lead to MWP changes.
In order to better understand this conflict, it should be noted that the letters w in Wales and the English letter u of Yorkshire have a similar accent.
On the other hand, the commission of the assembly, which is creating a legal draft to make changes to names, has said: "As for the members of the assembly, they will have the only responsibility to choose the descriptives they wish to use."
According to the 2017 Act of the Welsh government, the Welsh assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to choose the proposed proposals and generally received many statements of solidarity.
With regard to the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name of the Welsh Parliament Member or WMP (in English sign), but the name MWP was decided in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly, on the other hand, suggest replacement options, but it can be extremely difficult to choose an opportunity with a mouth, particularly for the Presidents of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who has had to send a draft with changes in a few weeks.
However, the legislation of changes that will be made will affect the functioning of the assembly, among other things, rules will be created to avoid activities that would result in losing a good name to members of the Assembly and the design of the assembly system will be handled with the help of this law.
When discussing the change in legislation, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make the decision to hold in relation to their names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether to change the country's name as "North Macedonia Republic".
This popular vote has been arranged to solve the long account of the last decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The Athenian government has long stressed that the name of the northern neighbour has repeatedly prevented the request to enter the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is an opponent of the plebiscite to change his name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, followers of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say it is only the price to be paid to enter the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church bells lose their voice due to the problems of Harlem churches
"I've spoken to so many elderly people and they say you could find a bar and church in every corner long ago," Mr. Adams says.
Today, there is nothing."
He says that the disappearance of Tabern is normal.
"People use other methods to socialize," he explains.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms used to bring people together."
As for churches, he is worried that the money obtained for asset sales will not be enough and "first or later we'll be back at the start point."
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and property full of people who don't care about the neighboring temples will be built.
"People who will buy property housing will be white people," he says, "and therefore the churches will quickly close because these new people are not members of the congregations of churches."
The two churches were built by the White People's congregations before it was a black Harlem metropolis; it was the Metropolitan Community of 1870 and was built a decade later.
In 1930, the original methodical congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a congregation of black people took over the relay.
Reverendo John Howard Johnson's black congregation took over St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against the 125 commercial street shops in Harlem, who did not hire or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church suffered a number of damage, but Father Johnson's churchmen designed several plans to build the church again and commissioned to collect the carillo.
Reverendo David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, named the carillo the "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who played the carillo in July gave him another name: "The Treasure of Culture" and "inalienable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ngek at the University of Michigan, has also stated that it has been the first carillo of a black musician worldwide; the musician, Dionysius A. Lindek, went to play a larger carillo of Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that St. Martin has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, St. Martin has seen the troublesome goings of various architects and contractors, some of which brought about by secular leaders or bishopal sayings.
The parish assembly (a council of artefacting of layers), on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the contracts of these people "will be passed into the parish" because the parish has nothing to do with the contracts of architects and contractors sent by the diocesis.
Some parishioners have filed their complaints for the lack of transparency that the proverb has had.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old child when he was looking for oysters at the California Sea.
According to police, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on the coast of Californa, on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack was before 7 a.m. on the Beacon beach of Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's KSWB-TV channel in San Diego, he was swimming with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour, but his friend heard him scream, ask for help; then he swam with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel first thought that his friend was screaming with joy that he had found an oyster, but then realized that his friend was shouting "I've been fucked!"
They bit me!
"I could see his whole clause," said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark!" shouted Hammel.
The boy was taken to the hospital for children in San Diego and his condition is serious.
The species of shark that attacked could not be detected.
Captain Larry Giles of Sorose has presented a report before the media and said they have seen a shark a few weeks before, but the species was decided that it was not dangerous.
Giles has also stated that the victim's wounds are at the top of his body.
Police have closed access from Ponto beach in Casablanca to Swami beach in Encinitas so that they can conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure people's safety.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans enter the United Kingdom's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores and now offers large sales-style beauty series with various expert and specialized workers.
While the sales of fashion and domestic products are decreasing, 2.8 billion francs have been invested in the United Kingdom beauty sector, which is growing indefinitely; larger series of beauty will be built and tested in 11 stores in the country. If they bring good results, they will open in more stores next year.
Thanks to investments in the beauty area, supermarkets can take advantage of the departments that sold television, microwaves, and household products.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their offer of beauty products will be doubled and offer more than 3000 products; it will also include Revlon, Essie, Tweezman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands in customer jurisdiction.
As for L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more space in branded areas, like areas that can be found in Boots stores.
Furthermore, the supermarket re-presents its "Boutique" brand makeup, which is a completely vegan product; younger buyers demand such products more and more.
Furthermore, the emacid offered by the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will try two stores in Sainsbury's supermarkets; the first opened in Croydon, southern London) last week and the second will open again at the end of the year Selly Oaken, Birmingham.
Due to online shopping and trends in buying food in small local stores every day, supermarkets must work head and ear to attract customers.
Mike Coup, CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, has said that the sales points will take on the style of large stalls and reduce the threat of the supermarkets from the temporary and Lidl competitors by offering more products that are not service and food.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats, after the two chains have purchased it two years ago; for this reason, food sales have been strengthened and the chains purchased are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to re-open the series of beauty and medicine, but the strategy failed.
He then joined Sainsbury's Boots in early 2000, but that association ended because the process of dividing profits in supermarkets' medicine series had become a burning paper.
A new strategy was organized when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281 stores medicine businesses to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million freedmen three years ago.
Lloyds chain will have a function on the organized plan: it will add a large range of luxury brands for skin care in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said: "We have improved the appearance of beauty departments so that our customers can find perfect environments.
We have also hired experienced workers to provide specific advice on products.
We have designed our set of brands to meet all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy opportunity in front of shops that use obsolete methods."
Peter Jones is "slighted" after Holly Willoughby cancels an offer of 11 million francs
Dragons Den's program star Peter Jones went "infused" because he wants to pay full attention to his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV after the TV presenter cancels the offer related to the eternal brand business.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand that sells home products and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
This Morning program presenter, 37, Instagram was used to present his resignation.
To accept contracts offered by Holly Willoughby's resignation by Marks & Spencer and ITV, Dragons" Den's star Peter Jones was extremely angry at leaving the big profit business created between them at the last minute.
According to our sources, a tense meeting took place on Tuesday at the main sede of Marlowe and, as a result, Jones was "slightly angry" when he heard the explanation of the most famous woman on our TV: that he would accept new contracts of 1.5 million francs and therefore could not spend more time in the products and components of the Truly brand house.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's property of 11 million francs.
Willoughby, 37, after announcing on Instagram that he left the Truly brand business, Jones left the United Kingdom to go to a holiday house.
One source said, "There has always been that option among Holly's priorities.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us with a full mouth.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, just when the brand offer was about to close.
Moreover, Marlowe's residence warehouse is full of products to be sold."
According to experts, the company is about to lose millions of francs for the departure of the presenter of the This Morning program (which is the most profitable presenter in the United Kingdom); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including cushions, candles, clothing and home products) and will have to deal with delays that may be produced now.
This can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and have been best friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Cappe created the Truly mark in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered as director in March.
Both couples always organize their vacation together and Jones has 40 per cent of Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will be the ambassador to the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program of the ITV channel.
A source of Jones' team stated last night that he would say nothing about his business activities."
A tough conversation, yes, but then "we fell in love."
He was joking about the wrong words he had to endure because of the media, all for making a "disegotiate" comment on North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give so many things?
Trump has used his "television" voice to answer in jackets:
"I didn't give anything."
After his first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said Kim wants to organize a second meeting, which has made a tremendous important step on the way to North Korean nuclear disarmament.
However, the nuclear disarmament process has stopped.
Three months after the meeting in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told UN world leaders: In the general meeting on Saturday, North Korea has not seen a "good answer" from the United States, with respect to the steps the country's path to nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have hardened in order to keep the country pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more positive view and has stated so in his final speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever," he said.
"We were also about to declare war with North Korea."
Millions of people could be killed by that war.
But now we have this extraordinary relationship between our hands."
He also said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to good results, including missile tests are over, the processes of releasing hostages have improved and the delaying of military personnel in the rest of the United States is ongoing.
He also explains his unusual point of view, with respect to his interviews with Kim.
"The President's work is extremely easy, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into the country by force, we have 200 people here," Trump said while pointing to the personal gathered there.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquakes destroy an island and hundreds of deaths
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, the support of international non-profit organizations was not necessary.
Although 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (it is a precondition for the aid of the dances).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said it did not need international assistance, so this is a challenge," Mrs. Sumbong says.
Save the Children is forming a team that will go to Palura, but he still doesn't know if volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representatives of the agency for national disasters, according to what has been said, Indonesian officers are working in Palun to accept the support of international agencies.
Despite Indonesia's many earthquakes, the country has understated measures to combat the rage of nature.
Forts against tsunamis have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu has no siren to warn people and, although the warning is in progress, perhaps that is why so many are dead.
When the weather is good, traveling between the Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters make it difficult to implement logistics.
A hospital ship for treatment to victims of the earthquake was anchored in Lombok and now goes to Palura; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of disaster.
The campaign of President Jo Widodo was based on Indonesian infrastructure improvement projects and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funds have been reduced and the administration of the President of the Game is in distress while preparing the next year's election.
Also, Mr. Game has trouble controlling the tensions of the Indonese sects, for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands of their homes have lost their battles to the streets because the flags of Christians and Islamic people have taken their battles to the streets, including machetes, bows, arrows, and similar weapons.

The Cromwell State of Parliament becomes the ultimate goal of the tendency to "rewrite history"
If it disappears, it will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed several religious objects, the puritan fanatics of England did the same with several historical and cultural objects in the country.
The Cromwell Association, however, says Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "injustice" and that he is trying to "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is an inevitable debate about the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside the Palace ofWestminster; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself has never requested or organized the iconiclasms of civil wars in England.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for his actions that his ancestors, Thomas, had done in the previous century.
The amazing representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is part of the opinions of the 19th century and our historiography; several people still believe that this person's actions should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "less people than in the 19th century think this is, yes, but still a number of people believe that Cromwell was a defender of parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about monarchy.
It will remain the substance of historical debates whether or not it is a precise representation of that person.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has been the starting point of the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties involved in that starting point.
There may also be reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements gained with the title of "Lord Protector".
A pig kills a Chinese farmer.
A pig has attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man named "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a cut artery and was soaked in blood in a pighouse of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou Province, according to the South China Morning Post specified on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the pig breeder prepares to insert pigs in Xining in China's Qinghai province.
Usually, on Wednesdays, Yunnan travels from Province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the dead man's body and saw that the door to the nearby pighouse was open.
He also stated that there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The court analysis report has confirmed that it was a 550-franc pig that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and crushed" by his cousin in Guiyang Evening News, whose last name is "Wu".
According to security camera recordings, Yuan can be seen entering the market to feed pigs at 4:40 a.m. (Thursday).
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin's side.
According to a market boss's statement to Evening News, the pig is locked up to prevent further attacks and let the police collect evidence of the place.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, some pigs' attacks have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at the Massachusetts basehouse, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-franc pig had surrounded a Welsh farmer in his tractor until the man's wife drove away the animal.
In 2012, the pigs of a Oregon farmer ate his body and then a farmer from Manitoba said that pigs in the news CBC News are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, that can function as "actors".
"They love to play.
They're like kids and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Small storms of Hurricane Rosa leave rainstorms in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather, Hurricane Rosa is weakening while going to the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days Rosa will bring rainstorms in northern Mexico and southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will produce 85 miles per hour wind, and will become a hurricane in category 1. According to the Eastern Time, it was found 385 miles from Punta Eugenia in southwestern Mexico.
On Sunday, Rosa is expected to go north.
Meanwhile, a point of low pressure is being created in the Pacific Ocean and will move east to the west coasts of the United States. On Monday, Rosa Baja California's peninsula will become a tropical storm and will carry tropical moisture from north to southwestern United States.
Also, on Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity will be combined with the point of low pressure and large rainfalls will arise in the coming days in the southwest.
In local places, 1-4 inches of dangerous water can be sudden floods, waste currents and groundfalls can be produced in the desert.
Rains produced by large tropical humidity can leave 2-3 inches of water at specific times and places, particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 inches of water in the southwest, particularly on Arizona.
Because tropical rains are wandering, they can cause sudden floods and narrative conditions.
It is not recommended to go for a walk in the desert if it has been warned of a tropical storm.
Rainstorms can turn rocks into violent streams and storms can lead to seasonal winds and dust.
Also, as the pressure drops, there will be local rainstorms on the southern coasts of California.
Due to rain, half-inch water can be collected and may create small waste currents and slippery roads.
This may be the first rain of the rainy season of the region.
Also, on Sunday and Monday, a series of scattered tropical rains can occur in Arizona, but there will be more rainfalls on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, rainfalls will go to four corners and expire until Wednesday.
October may have severe temperature changes in the United States, as far as Arctic territories cool, but the temperate temperatures of the tropics will remain.
Sometimes these temperatures have major changes in short distances.
As an example, there will be major temperature changes in the central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omata, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
In the next few days, the warmth of summer will come and spread everywhere.
The central and eastern parts of the United States will have a warm October; there will be 80 degrees temperatures from southern fields to north-east.
It can also be 80 degrees on Tuesday in New York; it will be approximately 10 degrees above average temperature.
According to long-term weather forecasting, the east of the United States will experience temperatures higher than average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people saw Tuesday's sixth channel news statement of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Kavanaugh for sexual abuse in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued and channel presenters interrupted Friday's permanent programming to provide a final minute news: Arizona Senator, Jeff Flake agreed to do a week's investigation with the FBI.
According to Ford's ruling party of the Senate, he is quite sure that Kavanaugh touched him repeatedly while he was drunk and tried to remove his clothes at a high school festival.
In Kavanaugh, he said in a passionate statement that he was quite sure that this had not happened.
Nielsen's data indicates that approximately 20.4 million people had seen the declaration on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
However, this number was not immediately available for other channels that issued a declaration, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching television in offices.
For an example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's declaration is fully acceptable while the channel presenters took a statement and, on average, he had 5.69 million viewers while he was making a statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC achieved $2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the declaration, people's interest remained.
Flake was the heart of Friday drama.
After reporting that the office of the moderate Republican Party would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS were recorded Kavanaugh while trying to take an elevator surrounded by protesters on Friday to declare it in the Magistrate-battle.
On the CNN channel it was seen directly with a look down while the protesters quarreled.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have a terrible power, but so many women have nothing."
At that moment and before the elevator doors are closed, Flake said his office had published a notification and will provide more details at the meeting visit.
Cable and television channels were sending their visit directly every hour and meanwhile the Magistratura-bacle Kavanaugh was voting on the nomination of Senators.
However, Flake said he would vote after examining the FBI's arguments against the candidate for a week; remember that the Democratic minority party was asking him to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flake was almost confident in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flaken's decision was powerful because the Republican Party doesn't have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without doing research.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "Playing with politics" as a Brexit basis

Wayde Sims killed by police arrest Dyteon Simpson for LSU player murder
Police have arrested a suspicious person for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year basket ball player at LSU University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-class murder crime, said Baton Rouge police department.
Police have shared a video of the discussion between Sims and Simpson and, according to police, Sims lost his glasses in battle.
According to the WAFB partner at CBS, police have recovered those glasses from the place of the murder and said Simpson's DNA was in them.
After asking Simpson, he confessed that he had shot Wayde.
His lawyer said his bail has been set at 350,000 USD.
The court office of the East Baton Rouge district published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is said to be a shot from head to neck.
The department thanks the department to find refugees from Louisiana State police, state police criminology lab, Southern University police officers and surrounding citizens for helping find the suspect.
The LSU sports manager Joe Allev has thanked the police for his "presponsiveness and protection of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-foot player grew up in Baton Rouge and his father also played basketball in Wayne, LSU.
He scored 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds on average in the last season's games.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the group was "earthed" and "surprised" by Wayden's death.
"These are things that always bother you," Wade said.
A volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
The ashes thrown by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
The national center before the disaster warned the Mexicans on Saturday and recommended being removed from the volcano after noticing various activities in the crater; 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded for 24 hours.
Half of the volcano also had several tremors.
According to social media images, thin ash layers can be seen in the winds of some of Mexico's neighborhoods (e.g. Xochimilcon) cars.
Geophysics have observed that the activity of the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the south-east of the capital, has increased since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 shook Mexico's centre.
The volcano named "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The fight between police and Catalan independents before the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people have been arrested this Saturday in Barcelona to remember the first anniversary of the elections that thousands of people joined the parties to vote for independence in Catalonia for independence.
Police against the riots stopped a group of independents disguised, but eggs and paint powder were thrown away, as a result, dust clouds were created in the streets full of tourists.
More fights were fought because the police were later using their bors to stop the quarrels.
Also, the groups for independence had been singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the Unionists who were singing "long life to Spain."
According to local journalists, fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries received during the quarrel.
There is a lot of nervousness in this territory that seeks to find independence after elections on October 1, which were illegal according to the Madrid government, but the Catalan independents achieved a day to celebrate.
Most voters voted for independence, but citizen participation was very small because of the number of citizens who wanted to boycott elections.
According to Catalan authorities, 1000 were injured after police attack because voting ships went to the places where the election were to stop voters, so there were violent clashes.
Groups of independence camped on Friday to avoid a demonstration for the national police.
There was a demonstration, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went to the demonstration for independence with his wife, and said that Catalonia no longer has any hope of independence.
"Last year we had a wonderful moment.
My parents wept with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After a Pyrrup but important victory in the last December local elections, Catalan parties for independence have had many problems in maintaining people's interest this year; some party leaders are either exiled or arrested and are now waiting for a trial for organizing a referendum and declaiming independence.
Joan Puig, 42-year-old mechanic is recording a police demonstration on his phone and says politicians on both parties are guilty of this situation.
"There's more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Orial Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been in prison since last year, stated that he would participate in the European Parliament elections organised for the next year.
"If I participate as a candidate in European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the restriction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government."

Menga's launch allows Livingston to win 1-0 in front of Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal confirms Livingston's height
Livingston promoted has impressed Rangers players and Steven Warrd achieves his second defeat as leader of the Ibrox club in 18 games.
Dolly Menga's launch was crucial that the Hibernian team in Gary Holten was promoted in the second part.
The Warriors team is out of profit during this season of Premiership and will have to play against Hearts leaders (which have eight points more) next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will have to play with Rapid Vienna on Tuesday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is not defeated and there are six games left this season; coach Holt doesn't know what failure is since Kenny Miler replaced in the last month.
Livingston loses several opportunities in front of strong visitors
Holt's team had to get ahead of him before he scored his goal; as he has tremendous correctness, he caused several problems to the Rangers team.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then Alan Lithgow turned his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were satisfied with letting Rangers play, but they knew visitors could bother them anytime.
And with that mood came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave a free shot and Livingston created an opening space; Declan Gallegher and Robinson were combined to mark Menga, but the latter touched the ball in the middle of the door.
At that stage of the game, Rangers dominated the property, but the home defense was uninterrrutable and the porter Liam Kelly spent the game without problems.
This model continued to the middle of the second part, but Alfredo Morelos' launch required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not mark the goal for Rangers' porter Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's other move.
The walks entered Livingston's area over and over again and again the home players; two penalties were requested, for the challenge of the representative Glenn Middleton and touching the other with his hand, but both were rejected.
Livingston's "Snotable" game - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC in Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's game was unique and the perfect result.
They have made extraordinary moves for me and have some really good chances to get up.
The style of the games and the team has hardly changed since they reached the top level, but Holt has been a separate coach: he has put the team on the right track since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been enormous; he has organized and managed an excellent defense and, Menga has taken care of making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
Rangers were not very inspired, however.
When they are under orders they work very well, but the standards set by the coach have been forgotten.
The last move has been too weak and have only been defeated once by the defense of the household; the Rangers team must hurry if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds opposite welcomes in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany; the visit was organized to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed some issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and access to Turkey in the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest number of inhabitants in Turkey outside Turkey.
Due to security measures imposed by police, 25,000 people were blocked that were intended to meet in front of the mosque, but several followers gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protests against Erdogan (most were Kurds) brought together their voices to protest against Erdogan's political measures and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
Protests on both sides reflected disagreements by the President; some German Turks say he is a hero and others say he is just an autocrat.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist dies from a car crash
A cyclist has died as a result of his collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn streets at approximately 10:15 a.m.; that road to Deptford, south-east of the city, is usually crowded with cars.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died there.
On Childers Street, a mile after the accident on Saturday, another cyclist died a month ago and the driver fled.
Metropolitan police are working to identify the man and warn his family.
Some roads have been closed and the permanent route of bus lines has changed; motor drivers are also advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six injured officers in a quarrel
Six prison officers have been injured in a quarrel in men's high security prison, the prison office said.
The quarrel arose in HMP Long Lartin prison in Monstershire at 09:30 (BST) on Sunday morning and the riots have not yet ended.
Expert officers "Tornado" have arrived in prison to end the quarrel that began by eight prisoners, so far, it has been confined to a wing of the building.
The officers had minor injuries to their faces and healed them there.
A prison service representative said, "We have sent expert staff of the prison to end the HMP Long Lartin riots.
We've healed six workers for the injuries we've taken.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who have begun to quarrel will deliver them to the police and will probably spend more time in the midst of the prison."
HMP Long Lartin Prison has over 500 arrests and among them the most violent criminals in the country.
In June, the prison alkaid had to go to the hospital for an arrest attack.
In addition, in October last year, the anti-injured officers were to go to prison to stop a serious quarrel, because the arrested were attacking workers with billiard sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (possibly the most dry area can benefit some benefits)
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but this will happen the following week while Hurricane Rosa exhausts her strength; she will visit the southwest desert and there is a risk of sudden floods.
The national weather service has already sent a warning about the sudden floods that may arise on Monday and Friday; the hurricane will enter the west of Arizona and go south and east of Nevada. It will also pass through the south-east of California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be held on Monday will reveal her arrival.
Phoenix National Weather Service has written in a tweet "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones created 200 miles from Phoenix have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
According to the latest predictions of the national hurricane center, 2-4 inches of water will be collected, and at most 6 inches of water will be collected on the edge of Arizona Mogollon.
With respect to other areas in the southwest of the desert (including the Stone Mountains and the Great Rock), 1-2 inches of water will be collected; in isolated places will be collected at most 4 inches.
As for those who expect sudden floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing due to droughts suffered by the territory.
The floods should not be underestimated, but these rainfalls may be beneficial for droughts that are suffering from the southwest.
According to the United States drought control service, 40 per cent of Arizona is suffering from severe droughts, which is the second highest category, stated that weather.com site.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path will pass through the Baja Californa Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa will remain on Sunday morning and will produce a maximum of 85 miles per hour; it will then be 385 miles from the south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and will have a speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific and as a result, its power is weakening.
They will arrive in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or night.
Since there may be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to the weather.com site, "the rain-drags will leave 3-6 inches of water from Baja California to the south-west of Sonora, and may collect 10 inches in some places."
Rosa will then pass through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the morning hours of Tuesday, then crossing Arizona and will go south on Tuesday night.
"The main threats of Rosa or its storms are the harsh storms that will arise in Baja California, north-west of Sono and in the southwestern desert in the United States," said the national hurricane centre.
These rains will produce sudden floods and dangerous debris in the deserts and groundfalls in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for trying to kill someone
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man has been arrested after finding a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsom at 04:00 a.m. (BST).
He was taken to hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18 years old and a 20-year-old man was arrested that night in the Radstock area (Avon and Somerset), police said.
If someone has any traces of what happened to the phone, police members have asked for their help.
Trump says Kavanaugh's Democratic Party "must deal with meaningless rage"
"The votes given for Judge Kavanaugh deny the ruthless and angry tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in Wheeling's mitine,West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh should suffer the "sense and rage" of the Democratic Party during his naming process.
On Tuesday Kavanaugh testified before Congress, and completely refuted Christine Blasey Ford's allegation; according to the woman, Kavanaugh raped him a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his allege.
The President said on Saturday, "The citizens of the United States saw Kavanaugh's courage, intelligence and quality that day."
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this jurist has spent his entire life to protect public services," said the President to West Virginia followers.
Not only did Kavanaugh's appointment, but also talked about the importance of the Republican Party in this election.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections of our lives.
I won't participate, but I'm campaigning," he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight on the side of the perfect candidates."
Trump also said that the Democratic Party is using strategies for "exploiting and difficult" campaign.
According to CNN, a high-ranking Republican party said, the processing act of voting for Kavanaugh will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami; the number of dead increases
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis caused to the Sulawesi Island of Indonesia; most of them died while giant waves destroyed the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in Palu, but in the evening the waves six feet (18 feet) destroyed the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything on the road was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat warning was issued yesterday, but people were still doing a lot of activities on the beach and did not run away immediately; therefore they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in an interview given by representatives of the Indonesian disaster agency (BNPB).
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs, and houses and destroyed everything in the territory," Nugroho says; indeed, the tsunami has traveled from the open sea before reaching the coast of 800 km/h (497 m/h).
"Many people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived," said the representative.
Approximately 16,700 people attended the 24 centers of Palu.
Several buildings and shops destroyed, a mosque surrounded by the broken bridge and water can be seen in photographs taken by the disaster agency.
The earthquake replicas continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in a land of 2.4 million people.
According to the report published by the Indonesian Technology Validation and application agency (BPPT), the energy level released by the main earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is in a long and narrow bay, may have something to do with the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
According to Nugroho, the disaster has been extremely "high"; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims' bodies have been found among the ruins of destroyed buildings, resulting in 540 more injuries and 29 people have disappeared.
Nugroho also said that the number and disaster of victims can increase along the coast of Palu 300 kilometers (190 miles); particularly a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
Donggala media "does not work and we don't have any information," Nugroho said.
According to Red Cross data, there are over 300,000 inhabitants in this place, for now, they are going to places caused by the organization's staff and volunteer to provide assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received strict criticism from providing information about the tsunami that destroyed Palu, but according to officers, waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a recording shared on social networks, a man in a building can be seen, and he is shouting "sunamy coming" to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Since the tsunami that was earthquake has generated general electricity cuts, all the media in Palu has been suspended, so it has been difficult to organize rescue efforts for the competent authorities.
According to authorities, the military has sent assistance from Jakarta and other cities in cargo aircraft, but evacuated still need food and priority goods.
The city airport has reopened to facilitate support efforts and will be closed to the public until October.
President Jo Widodo will visit Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The Indonesian tsunami leaves more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
The workers of the World Vision in Donggala have arrived in the city of Palu without problems (the workers in it have built an oil shelter in the courtyard of the organization's office), but they have directly seen the terrible situation left behind by the disaster, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they saw a lot of houses ruined," he said.
That's really bad.
Although support groups began the sad repairs of work in cases of disasters, some complained about what experienced workers and assistants advised not to go to Palura.
Following Indonesian legislation, the international funding, supply and employee supply zone can only begin after being classified as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
When the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can open the doors for international aid, but it has not yet been classified."
On the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palun, the friends and families of those who were still missing did not lose hope of the miracle of the least likely to appear their loved ones.
On Saturday, a small child was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled out a woman stuck under the ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to him.
Gendon Subandono, trained two of the parapentists who were part of the missing Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia during this month.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi Jn., were students.
"As an expert in the world of transparency, I have my emotional charge," he said.
Gendon Jn. explained that in the parapentist community was reported around the fall of the Roa Hotel in the following hours, he had been sending WhatsApp messages to competitors, which were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only got one grey arrow, no two blue marks.
"I think that means those messages were not sent," he added.

Kanye West: Rapero changed its name, now it's Ye
Canadian Canye West has changed its name - it's now Ye.
He announced his change on Twitter on Saturday: "A creature known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has used the name Ye for a while, and has used that nickname as its eighth album in June as its title.
He made the change before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, as no was expected to present his latest album Yandhi.
He took part in the show instead of Ariana Grande, in the words of the show creator, who could not participate as a result of "in emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has stated that this word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most widely used word in the Bible and means "you" in the Bible," West recently stated, talking to the album with the big Boy radio presenter.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means only one, to become Ye- becoming a reflection of our good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This work reflects better who we are."
He is one of the famous rapists who changed his name.
Sean Combs also met Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has stated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly collaborated with West, has also changed the little lines and capital letters.
Mexican AMLO has promised not to use the army against the people.
Mexican elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised not to use armed force or army against citizens when the country will experience the 50th anniversary of a repression that flowed against students.
Lopez Obrador, who swore on Saturday that he will never "use the army to repress Mexican citizens."
On October 2, 1968, the army fired against a peaceful appearance in the square, and 300 people were killed to interrupt the rise of leftist students who were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn, with monthly financial aid and opening more free public universities.
In his words, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to criminal groups.
The US should double the AA funding
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it uses to study in that area, says the investor Kai-Fu Lee and expert AAn, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies.
Comments arose when several U.S. government parties made several notifications about AA, although the US generally has no official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to make AA the best innovation by 2030.
"Actuating research would be a good start, as other countries are far from the US and are looking for the next discovery in AA," Lee said.
Duplicate funding can double the chances of making large AA discoveries in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Miffy Harcourt, is Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who has researched in one of the most important companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AA system that passed the American top Othello player and later worked as executive at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the Chinese field.
Lee praised the previous technology competitions of the US government, including the Robotic Competition of the Advanced Defense Projects Research Agency, and asked when the next one will be to help identify the next dreamers.
US researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee says.
"It doesn't mean China takes academic leaders, they're companies," Lee added.
Facebook, Google and many other technology companies have taken the clearest companies at universities to act in AA in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies would also help the US to encourage AA activities.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to the AA doctors," he said.
The Chinese State Council adopted the Next Generation Development Plan of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation finances people from academic institutions as the National Science Foundation and other government institutions do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is less, Lee says.
That year, before that year, the U.S. Department of Defense created an Artificial Intelligence Center in which partners from industry and education met, and reported that the White House had formed an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA has reported an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As for NSF, he invests more than $100 million a day in AA's research.
Meanwhile, EU legislation intended to form the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not had any progress in recent months.
Macedonians had a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name or not.
Macedonia's country voted by referendum on Sunday to decide whether or not to change the name "Old Republic of Macedonia". This change would end the conflict of several decades since Greece blocked the possibility of becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, formerly called Macedonia, still claims that the name of the northern residents still occupies its territory, which blocks the possibility of entering NATO and the EU.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents say that this change is to harm the ethnic identity of most Slavian citizens in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott he committed to the campaign caused doubts about what 50 per cent will have to be achieved in the referendum to be valid.
The question that could be read on the paper of the referendum is, "Are you in favor of being a member of the EU with Greek agreement?"
Those who support changing their name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth getting the opportunity to enter the EU and NATO institutions for Macedonia, being one of the countries created when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I come to vote about the future of the country, for young people of Macedonia, because under the umbrella of the European Union that will bring us a safer life," Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, said in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to be decisive.
It will take three-thirds of the parliament to change the name.
The state selection committee stated that no surprises were reported until one noon hour.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to 34 per cent of the last elections for the 2016 parliament, in which 66 per cent of those entitled to vote voted.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevsky, 62 years old, in the capital, Skopje voter.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Fortune and son Dushko changed their votes in Macedonia referendum and the possibility of joining NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scenario and climbing stairs in front of shops that wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of the UNTO and the EU, but we want to meet with our conditions and not by the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asia unification."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership can lead to an investment so necessary to Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.
"I think the majority will be on the side because more than 80 per cent of the citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev declared after voting.
In his words, saying "yes" would "confirize our future".
According to the poll published by the Macedonian Political Research Organization on Monday, the vote would take part in the vote between 30 and 43 per cent of voters - less than necessary.
Another poll, of Telma TV in Macedonia, said 57 per cent of residents thought of voting on Sunday.
Of these, he stated that 70 per cent would be thrown out.
To make the referendum successful, you have to get 50 plus one vote in favor.
If there were a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious failure of politics for the West since it began in May last year.
See: Manchester City team player Sergio Aguero has passed all Brighton's defense to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling surpassed Brighton's entire defense on Saturday 2-0, Manchester City's 2-0 victory on the football field, Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored the goal entered in the 65th minute.
The Argentine Gol-maker picked up a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the play.
He ran among three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender after escaping from several others on the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he walked to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero in the first touch within the area, who used his right foot to overcome Brighton's janitor Mathew Ryan with the launch aimed at the right hand of the network.
"Aguero is overcoming a lot of problems at the foot," City coach told reporters, Pep Guardiola.
"We said he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were very happy that he scored his goal at that moment."
But Sterling gave blue shirts the initial advantage of the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in Brighton's field in the play.
He gave Leroy Sane a great walk on the left side.
San made a few touches before directing Sterling to the distant post.
The blue-stricken pushed the ball into the net before leaving the line.
City Hoffenheim will compete against the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at 12:55 p.m., Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end of Rockies
With the Nationals expelled from the competition, there was not much reason to force them to another beginning.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to make an advantage against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but Rockie still experience the effects of equality, which still have the advantage of a game to Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
Rockie has won at least 5-2 wildcards by winning the Nationals on Friday night, but they will still have to try to win their first title in the first grade.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we know that the atmosphere of Denver will be crowded, and the opposite team will play at the best level in every area we will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to announce a trigger, but it seems that they will let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th warning, made a launch show on Thursday and it seems to be what it would be like to act as a shooter on Sunday.
The Washington right hand has 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and has achieved 300 stripikeouts at 220 2/3 entries this year.
Trump's statements in West Virginia
The president examined the situation above and cited the situation around Brett Kavanaugh chosen by the Supreme Court when he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in the mid-season elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks later we have the most important elections in our lives.
He's one of the biggest -- I'm not a candidate but I am, I am, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for great candidates," he declared.
Trump added, "You can see the terrible extreme group of Democrats, you can see what's happening right now.
And they have no doubt about taking away power to use any necessary means, see greed, see the ignition.
It doesn't matter who to hurt, over whom to control and power, we won't give them that."
Democrats, he said, aim to "eaten and hinder".
He said, "As you could see in the last four days," the Democrats said, "that they are angry and prudent and disgusting and false."
He gave the name of Dianne Feinstein, Senator of the Democratic Party, of the Senate Court Committee, which received the cries of the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what.
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for one - that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labourers will not continue to have a great reach.
It's intolerant with those who say what they think.
When my local party activists voted against me, it was not a big surprise.
I am actually the last one on the list of those who were not welcome from the Labour MPs - for saying what we all thought.
John Ryan, who is a member of Parliament, also received similar treatment because he spoke for anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security in Europe, Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders in similar matters.
The news about the Friday East Nottingham meeting said, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Over the eight years I have been carrying as MPs of local Labourers, that is what Friday night's GC meetings have been.
Unfortunately, today it has not been remembered the word for "like, respectful" politics, if ever existed.
It is becoming apparent that there are different views in the Labour Party and opinions are judged whether or not they are acceptable to the party leaders.
This began when Jeremy became a leader, when members who had the same political views before turned 180 degrees and began to ask for views I would never accept - both national security and the only EU market.
Every time I spoke in public - it doesn't matter what I said - a lot of opinions that denounce middle policies on social networks and demand that I be removed from it, it happens, in terms of those who say I shouldn't be on the Labour side.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I have better luck than some of my colleagues because the opinions thrown against me are political.
I depend on people who face sexism or racism every day with professionalism and sincerity, but never ashamed.
One of the unpleasant aspects of the policy of this period is that the current level of harassment is considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, the previous week, stated that the Labour Party should promote the culture of tolerance.
We really don't get a single opinion when they become closer in each motion of "unconfidence" or when the rules of the party become tighter.
Over the last two years I have received so many notes to lower my head, not to talk so much, and thus saying, "I would be good."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I abandoned the room under the indifference of Thatcher's government and entered the public services that needed me most - as a local councillor or minister of government.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in Eastern Nottingham will hesitate about my political views and my disagreements with current leaders.
I would say to those who encouraged Friday's motion when the country is turning towards Brexit that will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the loss of time and energy when discussing my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my true message is not to encourage Nottingham, but for my electors, whether you are a member of the Labour Party or not: I am very proud to work for you and I promise you from continuing to work for what is best for your interests, they will not separate me from threats or political files.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who has not yet lost a game
The last two unexpected attempts somehow changed the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved victory in the day match of the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship.
They are in first place of the board, and are the only ones who have not lost any of ten games.
At the end, they had a better defense, and they took better advantage of the opportunities, the family and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested so far, and we haven't lost one, so we have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melros added, "My honors to Ayr, because they used opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute rehearsal, carried out by Frazier Climo, had previously placed Ayr, but the yellow card taken from Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, left by Warriors for the game, allowed Melros and Jason Baggot not to carry out the attempt.
Climo interfered by penalty leader of Ayr, who had previously completed his solo rehearsal at the end of the first part and Ayr 17-5 went to the break.
But Melrose began beautifully in the second half and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, carried out by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then there has been a long break due to the serious injury of player Ruarid Knott, who was taken out on his hand bed and when Ayr returned to the game, he turned Staffford McDowall's rehearsal into Climo.
Then, Captain Blair Macpherson Ayr drew a yellow card and once again Melros benefited from being a man more, with Bruce Colvine's rehearsal that had not taken place, living at the end.
The family returned and when Struan Hutchinsoni had a yellow card to prevent Climo ball from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the tree of the Ayr group moving forward.
Climo spat, as he had done almost from the beginning, Kyle Row caught David Armstrong's kick and drove Gregor Henry's wing out during the fifth rehearsal of his family.
Still Game series star will start a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the actor Ford Kieran wants to jump into the world of hospitality, which has been known to have been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis' famous BBC show, whose writer and one of the stars has long been a member of Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next season will be the last of the show, the ninth, and it seems that Kiernan is planning the life after Craiglangen.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has not wanted to express anything about the story, although the sources of Scottish Sun magazine said he wanted to join Kiernan in a "most important restaurant brand" in Glasgow."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia in the interior expects the courts to re-open the way towards the Pacific
Seaman patrol shipbuilding apparatus covering headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
From Lake Titica to Amazon, the following motto can be read: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to restore it."
During the interior Bolivia, the 19th century Chilean coastal conflict with abundant blood emissions still survive - as they continue to like sailing in the Pacific Ocean again.
These expectations are perhaps stronger now than in recent decades, because Bolivia hopes to resolve international courts after five years of reflection on October 1.
"Bolivia lives the right time, with a sense of unity and tranquility, and of course he is optimistic about the result," says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will continue the decision of the international court through huge screens distributed throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Court will give reason to Bolivia's demands - after decades of negotiation - Chile has been forced to negotiate about giving Bolivia the sovereign road to the sea.
Evo Morales, charming indigenous presidents of Bolivia - who is involved in the conflict of re-elected the following year - has also made several contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia and will consequently not change much.
The United Nations organization located in the Netherlands has no power to provide Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the results of the negotiations that may exist.
The International Court's resolution being six months after negotiations are over, indicates that the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than encouraging the cause of Bolivia, they have gone backwards for the last four years.
"The subject of reaching the sea has been taken as captive by the current Bolivian administration," said Zarat.
President Morales has ruined all the desire to do well in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile still have to deal with a number of issues, but it will be very difficult to continue discussing after that.
Both countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who say the court's resolution is particularly rapid.
On Monday Bolivia said, "It will have a great opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "to end 139 years of disagreement, for both good."
Calzadilla stated that Morales disagrees - still one of the popular presidents of South America - with those who say he uses the problem of the sea to get political help.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have a way to reach the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is the opportunity we should have seen to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can believe in the US
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be disarmed until Washington can believe.
Ri stated this before the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States at the summit of Singapore in front of enemy leaders to fulfill what he had promised.
This was stated by the U.S. Secretary of State that Mike Pompeo Singapore's North Korean Kim Jong Un is on the border to re-block nuclear diplomacy for more than three months.
Ri says "utopia" is thought to be "utopia" and that the US objections to the end of the Korean War will place North Korea at its feet.
Washington does not want to agree to confession before Pyongyang makes movements to reject weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is a lot of skepticism about Pyongyang who is serious about the only way to ensure its safety that the country looks like.
Pompeo's intention is to go to Pyongyanger next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show on your way to High Street has shown the newest line of massive hats on your side
If you want to increase your collection of hats or block the sun completely, here is the answer.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of large-sized jewelry hats in the spring-uda collection of 2019, which left the style shown in the Paris Fashion Week trembling.
This summer no practical hats have arrived on Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the passage.
Valentino's most prominent pieces, with a beix-colored hat with a pen-like wing, covered the heads of models.
Among other large-sized supplements we have a kind of angurri full of jewels, a rather strange hat, and also a kind of pin - but they are not designs for heating their heads.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have lips full and they look like Hannibal Lecter's than high tailorings.
One looked like a diver mask with glasses and pipe, while another looked like a little ice cream cuckoo.
If you are a fashion follower, you have good news.
Experts in style say that gorillas will go out into the streets, even to your surroundings.
Large-sized hats follow ‘La Bomba', a two-foot wide wing straw hat, which we have seen from Rihanna and wear to many famous people until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the hat that has been successful on social networks has led another object to the passage - a straw bag for the beach, almost as large as the model in the bathing suit that carries it.
The iron orange bag, cut with raffic lits and finished with a white leather handle in Jacquemus' La Riviera 2019 Spring-uda collection in the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage celebrite stylist said at FEMAIL: "I hope the big hats and the big beach bags reach the main streets next summer, with the great echo the designer has had, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for giant supplements."
John Edward: Basic language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland make records of academic excellence, and have continued in 2018, with separate results from exams, which have been strengthened with excellent individual and group results in sports, art, music and other community projects.
With 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools are trying to provide the best service between students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, their chosen career and as citizens.
As we can design and implement the custom school curriculum as a educational sector, we have seen that modern languages continue to have the usual choice chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you will reach his own mind.
If you speak to him in his language, you will reach his heart."
It is a powerful way to build relationships with people from other countries and remind us that we should not only use English to gain confidence in them.
From the results of this year's final exams we can see that there are languages in the upper part of the most exceeded in independent schools.
68 per cent of students studying foreign languages have achieved the best classification A.
The data, collected at SCIS's 74 students' school, show that 72 per cent of students achieved the best classification in Chinese Mandarin; 72 per cent in German; 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an indispensable capacity that young people and children will need in the future.
Languages are currently worked as a focus of subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools curriculum as well as others.
In 2014, a EU Commission poll found that one of the main reasons found at the time of filling the job was non-knowledge language.
More and more, knowing languages is becoming essential for preparing young people for future careers.
With more job opportunities that require languages, these skills are vital in the globalized world.
Whatever your chosen career, if they have learned the second language, will have a real advantage in the future with such a life advantage.
Being able to speak directly to people from foreign countries will automatically put the multilingual person at the head of the competition.
According to YouGov's poll of 4,000 EU adults in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak foreign language in such a way as a common conversation, and it rose to a two-digit figure among those who spoke French alone, 15 per cent.
That is why it is so important to invest in teaching languages in today's children.
Talking more than one language, mostly used in economic developments, will allow your children to find better employment.
In Scotland, schools differ according to the language they teach.
A number of students prefer more classical modern languages, and others seem to be important to the EU by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a wide range of language opportunities for learning in independent school with teachers who are experts in the field.
The aim of independent schools in Scotland is to prepare children to be successful in different tasks in the future and provide tools for it.
This time we cannot deny, in an international business environment where languages are indispensable to the future of the country, so that we need to reflect on education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunities, diversity and excellence to young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will debut with Lakers on Monday in San Diego.
LeBron James is about to end waiting for fans to debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has stated that James will play on Monday's pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he has not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"More than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a journalist, Lakers' journalist, announced on Twitter that James will play for a limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked at Lakers about the six-game programming of the previous season.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare for this stage of my career," he replied.
Trumpe's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin Rally's campaignball tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trumpe will be the first of five rallys for the next week, and will visit several places with friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for the vote that would give him confirmation to fill the square of the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support or support for elections in the mid-term election as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in November elections.
What time is the current mitine of West Virginia Trumpe and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trump's tour is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. today, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's mitina online in West Virginia via stream on YouTube.
Trump seems to direct the hearings of the appointed Brett Kavanaugh of this week's Supreme Court until you have confirmation of the Senate that has held the vote during the inadequate sexual position by the FBI's investigation.
But the main goal of this mitin tour is to help Republicans win some votes in the November election.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign states that the purpose of these five next week's mits is to "recovery the volunteers and to help them hold their majority in the Republican Senate and the majority of their representatives" according to Reuters.
"The concert of Congress is of paramount importance and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," Trump's campaign spokesman said, who did not allow the Reuters agency to register.
Scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, will allow today's mitina Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and coverage to the Pittsburg media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump will visit West Virginia last month, a state that won by 40 per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of the Republic of Virginia, who is following him.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have to go there to help the election," says Simon Header, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team will try to continue on Sunday's individual competition
After three sessions on one side, it was said that Saturday afternoon fours were what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key at the moment is the concept of sport invented from top to bottom in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say the time is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think now is the moment in some way," said Jordan Spieth, when making a one-day area.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points, out of the twelve at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and need help, mostly Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points from four.
Spieth has been absolutely decisive, from draw to green, and is directing with the model.
These cries to celebrate have been getting louder and louder as the shifts progressed, and he has concluded the important putt, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two.
He celebrated it with another cry like a putta won in the 15th match, which indicates that the American team is not out of the competition.
"You must seek strength and take care of your game only," Spieth said.
It's what's left with those players.
18 holes to make a difference.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood, historical players from the Ryder Cup tournament.
The special but charming couple in Europe are four out of four if they swear to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't launch a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they also avoided bogeys and the last nine on Friday afternoon.
This turn and the energy that came to the tumultuous crowd and the energy that came from it made him a couple to overcome on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina when the sun rises to close Europe's victory at Le Golf National.
It is better if both are in different holes together.
However, it is too early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubble Watson and Webb Simpson have accelerated Sergio García's work, the best of the fours when Alex was equal to Whose.
One and two doubles have been placed before the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that was never too close to defeat the Swedish.
On Sunday, however, there was no one to help out of your hole.
The four were fascinated to see closely the interaction between couples, the advice they gave, those who did not give and how the strategy can change at one point.
Europe played better as a team, and had a significant advantage for the final, but the four-piece show that the US team has the courage to fight, though some, particularly the Stateside, doubted.
Europe has achieved a 10-6 advantage in Ryder Cup final
Europe has drawn a significant advantage in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's fours have reached 10-6 against the United States of America.
The inspired couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina won two victories strongly against Tiger Woods, and achieved four valuable points so far at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn in Europe, trying to recover the lost prize in Hazel two years ago, was dominant in the morning, and won 3-1 series.
The US offered more resistance, and won two games, but could not exceed the difference.
It took eight points from Jim Furyk to support the prize in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie who has won four consecutive points and with Molinari, who after a magnificent weekend called "Mollwood", second in the history of the Ryder Cup tournament winning four points.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs, he performed the game beautifully with 5 to 4 lights that were tired Woods and Bryson Dechambeau American rookie.
Woods, after playing two games in some way on Saturday, showed touches of excellence, but lost 19 out of 29 games in fourballs and foursos, 7 consecutive.
Justin Rose rested for morning football and returned with Henrik Stenson to defeat 2&1 in the fours Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best and third in the world.
Europe did not find its way in the pleasant, cool day of southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spiethe won three times and Justin Thomase established a reference for Americans, two points, on Saturday.
They won a 2-1 vague victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and then they also passed Poulter and Rory McIlroy after losing two initial holes in 4&3 tiles.
In the history of the Ryder Cup tournament only twice, a team has managed to exceed the four-point difference and enter the individual, although Furyken's side only needed a draw to hold the prize.
After being the second best in two days, after Sunday's opposition, they will stand before him.
North Korea has given a round negative to leave weapons without any confidence
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continue to inhibit confidence in the United States and will not cease to make nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho pointed out to the World Organization's annual plenary meeting that North Korea took "a significant measures of good intentions" last year, such as interrupting nuclear weapons and missile tests, leaving places for nuclear tests and promise to develop nuclear technologies and weapons.
"We don't see any adequate response from the US," he said.
"Without the US confidence there is no trust in our national security and, by no means, we cannot leave the first weapons alone."
Rik repeats North Korean family complaints about Washington resistance within a "stage" process for denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking steps. His statements seem significant in the past that he had not rejected the unilateral denuclearization of Pyongyang.
Rik Kim Jong Unelek and President Donald Trump and North Korean leader mentions the first summit in Singapore on June 12. Kim then promised to "decuve the Korean Peninsula", and Trump swore to guarantee North Korean security.
North Korea is looking for a way to end the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States of America has stated that Pyongyang must leave the first weapons.
Washington has not paid attention to international voices that require the penalties imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. says it will have to leave the first weapons and continue to increase the level of pressure of punishment, in order to force them to achieve their goal, and it is against the end of the war," Ri said.
"The thought that the Cygos will put us at their feet is utopia of those who don't know us.
The problem is that continuous penalties are increasing their deficits."
Rik has not mentioned the second peak between Kim et Trump announced in early weeks by US leader in the United Nations.
The minister, on the other hand, has mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the leader of South Korea and added, "If the other party were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked."
However, Ri's speech tone would be quite different last year, where he stated that North Korea was inevitably looking at missiles in the entire NB meeting, since Mr. Trump called Kim "Mr. Devil" on the suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who declared that he would "small" North Korea, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to reject weapons, but he stated that it was still necessary and that they would continue with penalties until North Korea had to be denutrified.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he was not in time to do so, "even if it's two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should award Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But, the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, stated before the NB Security Council on Thursday: "We must continue to strengthen the penalties of the Security Council without fail until we verify that its malnutrition is real."
The Security Council has unanimously encouraged North Korea as an attempt to block the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to block the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic programs.
Pompeo joined Ri outside the NB's plenary meeting and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has been in North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not work out.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, saying that something had only been achieved for North Korea, after hours he had accused him of making "the demands they make".
North Korea swore that at a meeting with Moon they would leave missile places and a nuclear complex if the United States took the corresponding measures to them."
He told Kim that "the measures that he was looking for" were Trump's agreed security guarantees in Singapore and had been directing towards the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take enough rest course
This year's Harvard University school year will be more likely to sleep more and more widespread culture of those who learn by drinking coffee for the night.
A teacher saw that at the best university in the world, students lose their prize in a basic way of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's hospitals, designed the course, which he believes is the first such thing in the EU.
He began his course when he gave a speech about the effect of sleep deficiency during his learning time.
"At the end of the day a girl came up to me and said, "Why should I do that alone now, in my last year of school?"
No one said he had told him how important it is to sleep well, which surprised me," said Telegraph.
In the course, first offered this year, students are explained the impact of proper sleep habits on studies and sporting results, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and university health services, stated that the university decided to start the course when students saw that she slept little during the week.
The long-hour course takes several interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom where students press coffee vessels, curtains, coaches and books to see the effect of caffeine and light, and to realize the importance of getting too little sleep on sports performance and the importance of sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are told that sleep too little can cause heart attack, and can increase depression or cancer risk.
On a campus map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on everyday habits.
"We know we're not going to change our students' habits all of a sudden.
But we believe they have the right to know that if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as your right to know the consequences it will have on your health," added Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride for "nighting," he says, and the increasing pressure caused by modern technologies and students increases the problem of doing little o.
Sleep well, with good quality sleep, should be "a secret weapon" to deal with stress, fatigue, and nervousness, he said - even to gain weight, because sleep makes the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California who studies chemical and physical biology has helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and had one of his first classes in Harvard's first year.
He stated that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to participate in a course that took up the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be asking for a similar study to graduates before entering the competitive organization.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm to determine when going to bed, and also to wake up, and to know the effects of the harmful effect of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga has overcome Gerrard's men
Rangers have suffered another defeat in Livingston that Dolly Menga's striped 1-0 for Steven Warrd.
They wanted to win for the first time after winning 4-1 St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holte's team caused the second defeat of the Warrior's team as a coach in his 18th match, allowing his eight points to escape the Hearts of the Landbrokes Championship leader without control.
Menga had gin seven minutes before the stripe break, and Rangers' work failed to draw.
Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has risen to the third and behind Hibernia are only due to the goal side.
The problem could have been more serious for Rangers because the Calum Spence wing had to be treated by an object that was thrown out of the outside.
Warrd made eight changes and managed to reach the finals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, Livi went with him, who took a point from Hearts last week and would be happy to see how his well adjusted clothes drowned his opponents on each turn.
Rangers dominated property, but Livingston benefited more from their moves.
The goal thrown through Scott Pittmani Allan McGregor on Menga's wing should be scored but the centre did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free shot by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammates Alan Lithgow only managed to get away from the back post.
Rangers took control, but in the last third, hope seemed to be greater than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should be a penalty on the border of the quarter when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson did not take into account the Colombian appeals.
Rangers managed to take only two shots out in the first half, but the former Ibrox janitor Liam Kelly had almost no problem with Lassana Colibalily's head and the slight blow of Oviedo Ejaria.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have hurt the development of the game, but no one can deny at least considering the great effort they deserved.
Rangers again failed to face a stop ball move in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallegher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Warrd took over the break by changing Coulily Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect when the wing passed to Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran from his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force outsiders to play their favorite game, playing long walks by Lithgow and Halkett for a long time.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase its advantage, but McGregor held him firmly before making a head from Lithgow Corner.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, asked for a penalty again at the end when Jacobs got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored him again.
Almanaka: The inventor of Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanaka: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA PRERERA ... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity: after that invention came what is called Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a milestone of science, and has also become a landmark of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who had no appearance to be a scientist:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Giger is a counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by mineral radioactivity."
Evans: "Yes, you can hear it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, missing a few days to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name remains alive.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system 'seeing' evil cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" and kill evil cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells within treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and then in the laboratory.
Then they can see a protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject it.
Test vaccine is producing very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to know evil cells, they managed to disappear more than 18 months of ovary cancer.
The method consists of "see" a protein common for many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Mary, said, "Our results show that we have a high future vaccine."
HER2 " encourages the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colon and onset cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in taking immune cells from patients and how to reach carcinogenic cells has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye entered a dam on West Trump, wearing a MAG hat, after the SNL appearance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shouted in the studio when he praised President Donald Trump in a Saturday Night Live and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a hat on Make America Great, began to speak ill of Democrats and confirmed his attitude towards Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person they say to me, "How do you like Trump, because he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have been away from America for a long time now," he said.
SNL began with a sketch with the protagonist Matt Damon. In this skitch, the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of the sexual assault allegations by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not sent, West's offensive speech was uploaded to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock West was trying to make fun of publishing.
He also complained in front of the public West that he had passed badly between his wings because of his hat.
"I've been attacked between the wings.
I was told, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a bottom-up place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place that is ruined?" saying, "I'll wear my superman cloak, which means you can't tell me what I'm going to do.
Try love."
As a result of his words the whistles came from the public at least a couple of times and the members of the SNL session seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, and a person in it said to the magazine, "The whole story was completely silent."
West was brought to replace Ariana Grande at the last minute, for her boyfriend died a few days earlier, the rapper Rac Miller.
The website surprised many people with the interpretation of the song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, head of the Conservative TPUSA group, who published this tweet: "To one of the most daring spirits: thank you for the MAFIARIA."
But as the presenter of the interview show was tweeted by Karen Hunter, West simply "was being the same as he is and that's great."
"But I don't want to reward a person who makes an ideology harmful to the community (using his music or clothes or protecting his "art").
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying "a creature named Kanye West so far."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows Diddy's footsteps, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His partner Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, and how not to mention Prince's music legend, who changed his name to a symbol and made him a Prince artist who had hitherto been a Prince.
The murder effort charge for stabing a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder effort on Friday after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident was in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in the First Court of Appeal in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has opposed toxic masculineity
Kit Harington is known for the role of swordman Jon Snow in the medieval violent fantasy series of Game of Thrones HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has opposed the stereotype of the machinist hero, stating that as a result of such papers appearing on the screen, young boys often feel that they must be hard to be respected.
In his statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said in his opinion that 'something has been done wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculineism during the time of #MeToo.
Kit also married Rose Leslie, who is a star of Game of Thrones and also a 31-year-old Rose Leslie, and admitted that she must face the problem ‘that she is convinced'.
"Personally, and with great certainty, I think at this moment - what have we done wrong with masculine?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they grow up, considering the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also have its responsibility in terms of the increase in toxic masculineity due to being highly masculine characters.
He continued, "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they must do this way of being a man?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time, how can we change that?
It's obvious that something went wrong for young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make a previous or successor of Game of Thrones when the series ends the following summer, and said he has "mothered with battlefields and horses".
From November it will appear on Kit Sam Shepard's return to True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother; his brother is a thief.
The actor recently reported that his wife Rose was the best thing that Game of Thrones has given him.
"I met my wife in this session, and so she gave me my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritete, a woman who loves Kit's Jon Snow character, won the Emmy Award in the fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in a settlement of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Hyesa: China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
There are over 80,000 people in the country affected by health authorities.
More than 40,000 new cases have been recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are transmitted through sex, which is a change to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly due to blood transfusions contaminated in some parts of China.
But the number of people who were infected with HIV was reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China year has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Due to conservative values in the country, it has been estimated that 70-90% of men having sex with men marry a woman.
Many diseases are due to using inappropriate sexual protections in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to HIV medication within the attempt to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the data of the GOP senators leaked by the worker, and has turned upside down 'the dangerous lies' and 'conspiration theories'.
U.S. ord. Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that a member of his staff published personal information for three Republican senators in the United States on the Wikipedia pages of legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrats have stated that the assertions were "ultra right-wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published contained information from three U.S. senators: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during an hearing of allegations on inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Senate Commission's Supreme Court.
The leak was questioned by the three senators and came later.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source was associated with Waters' office and published information from a Waters team member, Hill stated.
"This untired claim is completely false and complete lie," Waters continued.
"My team members - anyone who has been at risk of identity, personal information and security due to these false fraudulent allegations - has no responsibility for the leak of that information.
The groundless allegation is completely false and completely false."
Waters' statement immediately received criticism online, such as Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
"That denial is made of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"That shows that he has no character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is charged with something they haven't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to show a challenge attitude.
He must not question the reasons for the accuser.
He must appear calm and tense."
Fleischer seemed to want to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry at his hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, also Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the central legislative election, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"If the meaning is true," he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said he warned his offices as "the authorities and entities to enforce the law were concerned with these fraudulent statements.
"We assure you that those who have broken the law will know what they are," he continued, "and that they will have to respond before the law for any member of my workgroup and all actions that are harmful and dangerous to all members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - Parody of the spy Rowan Atkinson
Now it has become traditional to search for the meanings of Brexit in any new film with a British ray, and it seems that this is not applicable to Johnny English action comedy franchise. He started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Can we get a new export opportunity for our nation by making the satire of ourselves?
In any case, Johnny English, with large eyes and rubber faces, has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time: his name shows above everything that is only a broad comic creation designed for territories that are not English.
Despite his particular desire to get a flattering Glamour, he is a stupid secret agent who looks a little like Clouseu, of course, a ray of Mr Bean and a little bit of the boy who helps Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the mysterious passenger and international man that Atkinson interpreted on television ads that we have already forgotten, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two major moments in this last JE ride.
I loved how Johnny English came up to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and that the rotor's crosses beat him in his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is seen on the screen, but humor lacks strength and is too superfluous, especially when the "seconds" like 007 and Mission Impossible are now included in comedy among their components.
Humor seems more than aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English's absurd adventures are not as clever and clear as the jokes of the character Bean in Atkinson's silent films.
The constant topical premise is now that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has been leaked into the supersecret web network of spies in Britain, revealing the personalities of all British agents working, and the agent in service is upset. Unfortunately small paper for Kevin Eldon.
This is excessive for a prime minister with a ponposo and persecuted character, who is already losing political reputation completely: Emma Thompson gives the best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help too much.
His intelligence consultants inform him that, since all active spies have been compromised, he will have to recover someone in retirement.
And that means Johnny English is going the same way he can. Now he's a teacher in a fancy place, but he's giving confidential schools about acting as a secret operator: some nice jokes there, which offers the spy academy of the type 'School of Rock'.
English is again taken to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting, and meets again with his first partner Beugh. Again Ben Miller interprets that character.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, Vicki Pepperdine is lost in that role of a little rich boy.
So we have Batman and Robin again in action to make things sorry for Your Grace's Secret Service, meeting Olga Kuryleenko's beautiful femme fatale.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, who says he can solve computer misfortunes in Britain, is fascinated by the Prime Minister. Jason Volta is cunning, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their farts, disguised as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant. They create chaos by secretly entering Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers complete anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality helmets to see what Volta's house is like inside.
All stops are made to look at this last sequence, but despite being nice and noisy, it all has a lot from children's television.
So-mode.
And as it happened to me with other Johnny English films, this came to mind: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that the British film industry deserves?
The Labour Party has denied that the British work in a four-day week but is preparing a plan to collect five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that makes the British work a week of friends a day but predicts to collect five days.
It seems that the employer of companies wants the party to give to employees what has saved through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them a more holiday.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but they would still take the same salary home.
Sources have stated that the idea is 'well' on the party's economic agenda and wants to put the country for workers.
Spending the week of four working days has been supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way that workers profit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour Party has stated to The Sunday Times: "A policy resolution is anticipated before the end of the year.
"It won't happen from day to day, but the week of four working days matches the party's view of re-establishing the economy for the working economy, and the party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the party that protects such an idea, as the Green Party defended the four-day working week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not yet been supported by the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party's voter has stated: 'Four-day work week is not party policy, and the party does not take this into account.'
Minister John McDonnell, who is in the shadow, used the Congress of the Labour Party last week to determine his view of a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that no doubt the power of ‘faced directors' and 'speculators' should be deprived of the power of public services in companies that offered public services.
In addition to the shadow minister's planet, the current shareholders in the water companies may not receive their full share, for a Labour government can make subtractions if you see there has been an wrong behavior.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to include workers in business directors and create inclusive Property Funds to provide 10% of the capital of private sector companies, which could collect annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy call "60 Minutes" whether or not FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their opinion
The investigation by the FBI with regard to charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his appointment for the Supreme Court at least a week, and has doubted whether the effects of the investigation could lead to the removal of his protection by a republican senator.
In an interview sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent at 60 Minutes, asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open than his partner in South Carolina.
"Of course I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said as I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the allegation has been revealed, I said, "Did you do that?"
He answered irritably, clearly, without a doubt."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be written on stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh and would also suffer the accusation that would cause an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it with all firmness," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who speaks of him has been able to verify that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday will be the Global Citizen Festival in New York, an annual music event that brings great artists and has a huge mission: to eradicate world poverty.
With the seventeenth edition this time, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Field of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the actual purpose of the event, i.e. the disappearance of extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citien Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. This project is an international promotional group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free entry for the event (if you are not willing to pay a DVP ticket), those who wish to attend the concert must perform a variety of tasks or "actions" such as sending an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or make a call in any other way that serves to help increase awareness of the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what success has Global Citien achieved when he has 12 years left to fulfill his goal?
Is it an original idea of encouraging people to ask them to take an action through a free concert, or just another case of what is called "clicktivism", that is, to make people feel like they are making a real change by signing an online request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citien says he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of his followers, putting pressure on various goals.
He says that these actions have led the world leaders to announce policies and commitments of more than $37 billion, and these policies and commitments will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and predictions derived from actions, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid or received.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on 649 million people around the world.
Among key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and implementers who are committed to "help children develop their full potential", which is headquartered in the United Kingdom." He has promised to give Rwanda $35 million to eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citiens.
"With the help of the UK government, donation donors, national governments and members of your kind, we will make the social injustice of malnutrition pass into history," said the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition in public, at a live concert held in London in April 2018.
Furthermore, the group has said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition project. This project will help 5 million women and children through nutritional-related interventions.
In response to this FAQ questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citien replied, "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great movements against our previous civil rights and apartheid, we too will succeed, for we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be held, among others, at this year's New York event shows. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will present the event.
US could use the Army to slow down Russian energy exports as a "block" - Internal Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could use his Army to avoid Russian energy reaching markets, including the Middle East, has reported Ryan Zinke, as Washington Examiner has mentioned.
Zinke has stated that Russia's relationship with Syria - as it is remarkable that the legitimate government is operating there - it is just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern stomach of Europe," he said, according to information.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to manage it.
"The United States, with our Army, has the ability to ensure that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants of an event organized by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, i.e. participants of an event organized by a non-profit group that presents itself as the voice of the "consumers' energy" in the United States.
Washington compared approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, explaining that they are ultimately the same.
"Our economic opportunity with regard to Iran and Russia is to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-source" economy with dependence on fossil fuels.
Trump's administration came to promote exporting its liquidated natural gas to Europe and when Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers, came to an replacement mission.
For this purpose, Trump's administrative officials, and US President Donald Trump himself, trying to convince Germany Nord Stream 2 to leave the gas station project, which makes Berlin Trump's "gatibu" in Moscow's words.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gasway of $11 million, which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion meters cube, is only an economic project.
Kremlin says that Washington's passionate opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons, and that it is an example of unfaithful competition.
"I think we agree that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers should be able to choose providers," said Aleksandr Novak, Russian energy minister Rick Perry after a meeting in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has received a negative reception from Germany and has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organization, the German Industry Federation, has asked the US not to enter the EU's energy policy and the double-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), after a meeting recently held by Russian President Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "she will examine it deep" to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "examine" the presidential candidate after the middle legislative election.
Warren confirmed that while he was in a Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, he would examine the presentation.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government, which requires there to be a woman upstairs, she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine it deeply to present myself to the president."
Warren gave an opinion on Donald Trump at the Town Hall, "indicating that the country was taking the wrong way."
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has spoken clearly in criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
In any case, a poll published on Thursday has shown that most of Warren's electors do not think they should present themselves as president in 2020.
Forty-eight per cent of the "testable" electors in Massachusetts said that the senator should not present a presidential candidate, according to the poll by the Political Research Center/Boston Globe at the University of Suffolk.
Thirty-two per cent were in favor of presenting.
According to the poll, Deval Patrick is more protective of the possibility of presenting former governor, as 38 per cent have supported a possible presentation and 48 per cent against it.
Other names appearing in terms of a possible presentation of 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Bernie Sanders Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide for January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's trauma stress disorder at Donald Trump's election event
Track Palin, aged 26, spent a year after entering Iraq in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because of what my son is suffering, because of what he is suffering when he returns, I feel identified with the effects of stress disorder after trauma and other families suffering from the vulnerability that our soldiers bring back," said Donald Trump to the public of an election event in Tullsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that the arrest was "a remarkable account" and said of his son and other war veterans, "They come back a little changed, they come back hard, the other soldiers who are members and members of the air army and all other members of the army and the other members of the army come back asking if there is any respect for what they have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday, in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence attack against a woman, with a declaration due to domestic violence and intoxicating to have a weapon, according to the police voter Dan Bennett Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. protects the impugnance of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Columbia District are being protected by a new US policy that denies asylum to victims who are fleeing domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts presented a friendly statement on Friday to support a Washington asylum requester, defying police officers, NBC News reported.
It has not been revealed against federal policy in August the full name of Grace v. Sesssigos lawsuits presented by the American Union for Civil Freedoms.
He said that his partner "and members of his violent band" had caused sexual abuse, but US officials denied his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from the state who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which creates a large number of asylum seekers in the United States because they are countries with many problems with bands and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States revoked a decision made by the Committee of Immigrants' Appelations that allowed non-documentary immigrants to demand asylum from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, the Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that "new police ignores the state, federation and international law of years."
"The federal law states that all asylum requests must be assigned based on particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar violates this principle," explained the amicus curiae statement.
Furthermore, lawyers argued that the policy that denies access to immigrants in writing harms the US economy, which is more likely to become an activist and offer "the necessary labour hand".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give more asylum to victims who were fleeing domestic violence and army violence in June.
"Asiloa is available for persecution or fear of being a member of race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion," Sessisons said when he introduced politics on June 11.
Asiloa has never been in itself to solve all the problems that everyone is experiencing every day, despite serious problems.
Attempts to make a desperate rescue in Palu, while the number of dead has doubled, in the race to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation was becoming increasingly serious.
"It feels a great deal," said his 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while he had fever in the destroyed city of Palu.
"The ambulance brings funerals every minute.
Clean water is missing."
The inhabitants have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking their things taken by water, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, broken by the 7.5 earthquake, flooded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with his back and shoulder broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital.
Tears fell from his eyes, telling him how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake when he was in the hotel bedroom with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I crushed against the sand of the wall," Haris told Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then I heard silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they'll be good."
US Ambassador accused China of "attacking" with propaganda advertisements
After a four-page advertisement that encouraged mutual benefits of trade between the US and China in an ABE newspaper, the US ambassador has attributed Beijing to use the American press to spread its propaganda.
American President Donald Trump mentioned Chinese newspaper at Des Moines Register, the second most selling newspaper in Iowa state last Wednesday, after accusing China of trying to enter elections to the United States Congress on November 6. China denies the accusation.
The fact that Beijing was trying to enter the US elections has marked what US officials said to Reuters; it was a new campaign in Washington that was rising to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a trade war that is rising, during that war, each country has put a ralls on the imports of the other.
China's represalitions, at the beginning of the trade war, supported Trump's Republican Party for the intention of attacking exports in states like Iowa, China and the US experts have stated.
Terry Branstad, Chinese ambassador and former governor of Iowa for a long time, that is, one of those who export the most agricultural goods to China, has stated that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad has stated in an article at Sunday's Des Moines Reister, "China is now strengthening the attack by putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By scattering the Propaganda, he is making use of a strong tradition for American free press and press freedom by putting paid advertisements to the Chinese government in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the press-kicoco on Beijing Street here, there is little disident voice and no true reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people can have in terms of China's conflicting economic career, since the media depends on the firm control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular Chinese newspapers avoided the offer to publish his article", but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans drive female voters out before the mid-Law elections with Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warned
As many high-class republicans are waiting and defending the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will have a decline, particularly among women, in the next half legislative elections.
The emotions about this subject have been very great, and most Republicans are registered showing that they want to continue with the boot.
You can't go back on these matters," said Grant Reeher Syracyse, an article published on Saturday at The Hill University's University.
Reeher said he has doubts about whether the pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will be sufficient to calm the angry voters who are angry.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow, and not even in November," said the chief advisor Karine Jean-Pierre and the national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "There is November!" that Republicans who control the Judicial Committee were protesting before the Senate decided to proceed with the appointment of Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford being there, stated in Mic.
"Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation will be out of place," said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news website.
"People say they've had a great impact already; that's true.
But it may still have a greater influence, especially between women and young people of suburbs who do not have a fixed vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that they often do not give votes if they do not like the president."
Even before the public testimony that Ford explained the details of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that it could be a decline if Republicans decided to continue with confirmation.
"It has become a great illusion for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The issue is not whether the committee vote, the last vote or should sit in the chair of accused Kavanaugh, it is also a matter of how Republicans have managed this matter and how they treated the woman," explained the news channel to the news channel, the director of the group who helps him select the Democrats Guy Cecil "Priorities USA".
In any case, it seems that Americans are quite divided between Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses at the time of deciding which they believe in, but more people seem to do it for the second.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of those who participated believed with certainty or probably Ford's testimony, while 35% certainly or probably Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% have said they believed that Kavanaugh has probably lied or certainly in his declaration, and 30% have said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least those made by another accuser, which was reported by Deborah Ramirez.
Last week he declared before the Judicial Senate Committee that Ford had attacked that Kavanaugh was drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez has admitted that the Supreme Court candidate showed him genitals when they were at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
Anyone who invented the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to start a startup that aims to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Inrupt, Berners-Lee's Solid is a company based on the Free Software Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and what people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "to take over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data storage" or a POD.
The contact list may contain task lists, calendar, music storage and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify: they are all available in one browser, and all together.
The distinguishing feature of the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access information of a particular type.
The company calls it "the empowerment of people by data".
According to executive director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is: to put resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to help us make Solid useful to everyone.
Currently, these are the companies that make up Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about the need to make a complete change when their business models change completely from day to day.
"We are not asking for permission from them."
In a post published on Saturday at Medium Berners-Lee wrote in Inrupt that "the mission is to put an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed the Internet World Wide Web Council at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the time of launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this next time on the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann as First World War Victoria Cross
As a warrior of the First World War, the only clergy of the Church of England, who has received the Victoria Cross as a warrior of the First World War, has been honored, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglyse and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew he had received the highest British award for military honor.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandchildren on Saturday at Rushden in Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" to give the stone to his grandfather and display it 100 later.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion by crossing the Saint-Quentin Channel "that the fog was very closed and under the constant fire of guns and machine guns."
Then he hurried to the first line of fire, and with the utmost courage he led the line forward until he found a cannon he drove the line forward alone and threw them down three of the detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72 years old, said he knew that he knew that his grandfather's actions "he could never do it himself, but that gives great humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, established a flower crown after the parade. The parade was led by the Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero proves the protection that many people will give him."
MMA's fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig was placed instead.
Suppose you spend all night awake to see Bellator 206 full of people, and then they don't let you see the main session.
The sign of San Jose had 13 fights, six in the main calendar, and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the audience of the United Kingdom was shocked when the covering moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised to fight after waking up until the small hours of the morning.
A follower described Twitter as a "bad-like joke" for children's cartoons."
"A government law says that this content was not appropriate by 6:00 a.m., and they had to change to children's programming," Dave Schwartz, the chief vice president of the marketing and communication of Bellator, said when asked about the performance.
""Pappa pig, "yes".
Bellator's president Scott Coker said they will study programming to consider viewers in the future of the United Kingdom.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can probably fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning, and we can't fix that until it's Sunday our hour, Monday at their time.
But we're working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going forward and backward, and not all were very nice.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen again next time.
We'll put five fights instead of six, as we normally do, we tried to offer people more, and we messed up.
Unfortunately, it's a situation that will happen."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'determined' sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling despised on the other side of sex, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old boy said he didn't realize that until he went to secondary school, "not everyone was like him."
When speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he had spoken to others about the rights of homosexuals.
He also said that being a parent made him less important to win Olympic games.
The regular presenter of the program for a long time, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months of illness.
After appearing completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "remembered" compared to everyone else because society didn't allow boys and girls to like them."
He said, "To this day, feelings that make you feel despised and different from others have been precisely the real reasons that have given me the power and strength of success."
He wanted to prove that there was "something" in his own words because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they heard about his sexuality.
The sportsman who has won two bronze medals in the Olympic Games has become a high-profile LGBT promoter, and used participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries should decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had given his opinion because he felt that he was very lucky without suffering any effect that he could live openly and because he wanted to give others "experience".
Three times the world champion said that he fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dupin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "he caught him with surprise."
Daley married the oscar winner 20 years older than himself last year, but said that age inequality has not been a problem with each other.
He said, "When you're so young and so many things happen to you." He went to Olympic games at the age of 14 and his father died with cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through similar incidents.
The couple became the parent of his son Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley has said that his "full vision" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, 'I have to win a gold medal' was the only thing I had in mind," he said.
"And, you know, there are things more important than gold medals in Olympic games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011, aged 40 after diagnosis of mental cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You won't be able to be on the front row, Dad,' he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't accept it until he stopped breathing and died," he said.
The next day Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic games, and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I dreamed all my life: to put it before the local public in Olympic games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first song selection - Proud, Heat Small, who made him feel identified throughout the process of preparing for Olympic games and still kicks him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was not in shape, remained in the chair on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make a record when he plays the 47th game of Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will have to improve his form to avoid pretending bad.
Mickelson was breaking the mark playing 12 times at the event every two years, however, Captain Jim Fury sent him to his chair in Saturday's fourball and foursome modalities.
Instead of being at the center of action, as it has often been for the United States, who has been five times leading champions, split the day to be animator on one side and on the other side of working the game on the field, hoping to correct what makes him suffer.
It was never the most direct driver, nor at the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best option for Le Golf National's competitive dynamics, as the toughest players take over those who are lost.
And though the field itself doesn't scare enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game, on Sunday, will have to face Francesco Molina's British Open champion, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood rookie to win this week's four games.
The Americans, at the start of 12 individual games below four points, if they have a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely decisive.
Fury showed confidence in his man, who couldn't say much more.
"He understood the paper he had today, gave me a little blow on his back, and he said he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a tipping sportsman and has given these teams tremendously in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see two games playing.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we felt like we had to act like that.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Nick Fallo's record as the player who has played the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may be the end of the professional Ryder Cup career that has never reached its individual brand again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and has stopped in between seven times. However, according to Furyken, he has brought something intangible to the group.
"It makes him laugh, and he's penetrating and intelligent, he's usually joking with people, and it's great to have his presence," he said.
"Young players enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to see him.
He does a lot more than he plays."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage they have can disappear immediately.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows with experience that despite having a major advantage in the last day's individual round, Ryder Cup tournament can easily become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, he had a five-point advantage under the command of Seve Ballesteros against the Americans, but they won the tournament closely with a score 141 -2 and 131.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a great advantage that we had a great advantage in Valderman and barely won, and that we lost in Brooklin even though we had a great advantage," Bjorn (photo), said Bjorn (photo), having won 5 and 3 2018 classes on Friday and yesterday, having gained advantage of 10 and 6 on the Le Golf National Field.
So history tells us both to me and all the team members that this is not over yet.
We'll be working with full courage tomorrow.
We'll go out into the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are on the clipboard.
We aim to win the trophy, and we will focus on that.
As I always said, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the opposite side: the best players in the world."
Happy with the achievements of his players on a difficult golf field, Bjorn also said, "I never want to advance anything.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the individual's turn, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, each golf player must prove his full ability.
That's the message you have to convey to players: get the best you got tomorrow.
Now forget your colleagues, for they must also get their best out."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team is hoping that his players will play better than they are individually as members, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Fury himself has been in the same way on both sides of these last-day directional changes as a member of Brookline's winning team, and later lost against the European team when Europeans did the "Medina miracle".
"I remember all the words said," he said, when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, encouraged the players on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the beginning, as in Brooklin and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We have decided on that list of players, and we hope to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has a job of counter-attacking, and Rory McIlroy will have a rival in the final match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans of the upper middle order.
"I chose that team in that order because they are in a position to do the whole way," Bjorn said about the individuals selected.
The construction of the new German warship is postponed again.
The new frigate of the German marina had to be requested in 2014 to replace the old battleships of the Cold War, but it will not be built until at least the following year, due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media say.
The demand for a battleship called "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the main ship of new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit, which has mentioned a military spokesman.
The ship had to be introduced in 2014, but eleven problems after delivery have prevented this ambitious project being able to complete.
Four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class required by Marina in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It appears to have a powerful cannon, a technology for carrying out anti-airships and ship missiles and hidden actions (e.g., reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have longer maintenance capabilities: the newest frigates may be out of the original ports for up to two years.
However, due to constant delays, these warships with cutting-edge technology (which aim to project Germany's power) will become obsolete by the time they enter the service, says the Die Zeit newspaper.
The F125 frigate that has ended badly made a lot of noise in your media last year, as the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the marina had returned a ship to the shipyard after he delivered it.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media mentioned serious "information and hardware errors", as a result of which the warship would have been in use in combat missions.
Software errors were particularly important, the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by 120 sailors, i.e. half of the Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship has too much weight and as a result, its performance is greatly reduced, and it is harder to add novelty to the marina in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship weighs twice the similar class vessels used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project (including reduction training) is also the problem.
It is estimated to have reached $3.100 million from €2,200 that it should cost at first.
The problems with new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that the power of the German marina is reducing.
A few months ago, Hans-Peeter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the "good ships" of the marina are running out.
The representative said that the problem has increased more and more because no substitute has been given after the old ships were withdrawn.
He regretted not even a frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class.
The secret life of bats has been observed by the National Trust.
A new study has been conducted on a land on the Scottish mountain range to find out how bats use the food search landscape.
They are hoping to get more information about the behavior of these special flying mammals so that they can better determine their protection activities in the future.
Research carried out by scientists from the Scottish National Trust (NTS) will track common dwarf bats and soprano bats, and a large ear and Daubenton bat in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in essential locations, and the activities that bats will perform throughout the season will be tracked.
Workers in the United Kingdom health system (NHS) will also perform mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts perform sound analysis of all recorders, the frequency of bat calls will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then there will be a map and report of the habitat to obtain a detailed image on the landscape scale of bat behavior.
Rob Deware, who is a natural protection consultant at NTS, will determine which areas of bat habitat are, as well as how each species uses them.
This information allows you to determine the advantages of the work to treat habitat, e.g. the creation of meadows, and how to keep forests best for bats and species related to them.
The bat population of Scotland as well as the entire United Kingdom significantly fell in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects nests and lose habitat.
Wind turbines and lightnings also pose danger, as well as flies capture papers, chemical treatments in construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, as they usually hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the moment of taking their prey.
They use a sophisticated sink technique to detect flight road bugs and obstacles.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly perform observations, habie exams, and sometimes rescues.
In fact, the organization has created the first and only bat reserves in Scotland on Dumfries and the Threave land in Galloway, where eight of ten bat species live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the land manager, says the land is perfect for them.
"We have a great field for Thraven bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, and trees for many years; habitat is very suitable.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so thanks to our work here and on other land, we will understand what they need to be healthy."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check if there are bats before maintenance is done on the estates, since if only one nest of motherhood is accidentally destroyed, 400 female and young bats may die, and perhaps the entire local population could disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, pursue them, or bother them, as well as to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representing the bat protection organization, has asked the general population for help.
He said: We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations while his lawyers rush to denounce the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the acts of rape against him are "false news," and those who have done it want only "publicity" by taking advantage of their name.
His lawyer is preparing to report the German news reporter Der Spiegel who has published the complaint.
An American woman named Kathryn Mayorga has been accused of raping in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid $375,000 for keeping the incident secret, Der Spiegel stated on Friday.
A few hours after the prosecution was released, he has made a live Instagram video for the 142 million followers Ronaldo has on the platform, where he said the allegations are "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What I said today is fake news," said footballer who won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
"They want to get publicity by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get fame by saying my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel for accusations, which are said to be "an unacceptable publication on suspicions that affect privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said that the player will demand compensation "as far as the severity of the violation is concerned, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event took place in June 2009 at a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga were supposed to go to the player's bedroom, where he was supposed to have raped her from the sun, the Clark County district documents in Nevada say.
Mayora has stated that Ronaldo had knelt down after the alleged event, and said he was "a good man on 99 percent", but that he failed "in one hundred".
The documents say that Ronaldo acknowledged that the couple had sex, but the relationship was authorized.
Mayor has also said he went to the police, and took pictures of his wounds in the hospital, but later that he reached an agreement outside the court because "repressions terribly frightened" and "publically humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman has said she wants to reverse the deal because of the alleged event continues to traumatize.
When the alleged attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he moved to the great Italian Juve team due to a €100 million deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret it forever" loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will "will regret it forever" after "Brexit", business secreter Greg Clark said.
He also said it is "excusable" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement, it will stop the production of the factory in Burnaston, Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
Japan's car manufacturer has said that delays that would be in customs due to an unprecedented "Brexit" could result in loss of jobs.
The Burnston factory (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without agreement at the end of March, our factory production will stop," said the Toyota administrator of Marvin Cook Burnston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also stated that they are afraid that if they leave the European Union without agreement, trade between borders will work.
BMW, for example, said that after "Brexit" will close its Mini factory for a month.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks surrounding the supply chain if the "Brexit" takes place without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is "the current at any time", and the pieces arrive every 37 minutes, both from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union for cars created as requested.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, interruptions may occur on borders and consequently delays and without parts.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep an inventory of more than one day at the Derbyshire factory, as a result, production should be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's plan to "Chequers" for future relations in the European Union is "specifically measured to avoid these customs exams."
"It is necessary to have an agreement, we want the best deal, not only to secure current success, but also to make use of this opportunity in the future," said BBC Radio 4 on the Today program.
"In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have shown that it is essential that the very successful supply chains continue to do so."
Toyota has not been able to indicate how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, due to additional costs, the factory's competitiveness would be reduced and consequently the jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnston for 24 years and coordinator of the Unite union factory, said that the members are becoming more and more concerned: "I say with experience that if we lose these jobs, we won't get them back.
A government spokesman has said, "We have presented a specific and convincing plan for future relations with the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, according to the White House
The important meeting between Donald Trump and the general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "rewarded another week" while the conflict around the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special advisor Robert Mueller, the influence of Russia in the US election, the link between Trump's assistants and Russia, and Mueller is investigating the alleged justice landing of the president.
Trump has been talking about whether or not Trump will be fired as a result of Muelle's independence in Washington's last few months.
Previously this month, the New York Times has announced that Rosenstein considered carrying a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from post in accordance with Article 25 of the US constitution.
Rosenstein has cancelled the information.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, while the information they said he would resign was released.
Instead, he stated that he would have a meeting with Trump on Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump has said he prefers Rosenstein not to be fired, but then the meeting has been delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate judicial power committee, in that committee, Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, was tested.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secreter appeared on Sunday at Sarah Sanders Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "No date has yet been set; it may be this week, but I would understand that it will be delayed another week, considering everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We will see, though; I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will not agree with this statement very much: for Sanders has not given a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences has not been that television reporters are "great", but he said, "I agree that they are ambitious."
He then suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes many more attempts of questions than his predecessors," he said, and added without mentioning the evidence: "We have verified these statistics."
Sanders said they will continue to make press conferences, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that's much better than asking me.
We try to do this many times, and you've seen that we've done it many times in recent weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we allow you to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, when he participates in open sessions, or at press conferences when visiting the dignatarians.
He doesn't usually make press conferences on his own.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the President of the United States in New York this week, when he made a spontaneous and sometimes strange appearance in front of journalists assembled there.
The United Kingdom's health department secretary has written a letter to European Union workers working on the NHS system in Scotland due to concerns about "Brexit".
The health department secretary has written to employees of the European Union who work in the NHS health system in Scotland to thank them from the entire country, and to ask them to stay there after "Brexit".
The letter has been written that the United Kingdom is less than six months left the European Union by the Scottish Parliament Jeane Freeman.
The Scottish government has already agreed to take the cost of requests from citizens working in public services ("settled status").
Freeman has said in his letter: "In the summer, negotiations on "Brexit" have progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and is expected to achieve some decision by autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has increased preparations for a possible untreated exit.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to confirm that I consider the contribution of each employee, whatever his nationality.
European union colleagues, as well as those outside of it, bring useful experiences and abilities, and improve the work of health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without a doubt, and we hope to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie has been operated on an emergency after suffering a wound in his head.
Christion Abercrombie Tennessee State Tigers has been operated in an emergency after losing a wound on Saturday 31 and 27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Tenness reported.
According to Rod Reed Tennessee State's chief coach, the player has suffered a headache a little before the middle rest of the game.
"He's got into the Albo band and fainted," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personals have provided oxygen in the band itself, and have taken it on a bed for a deeper medical examination.
A representative of Tennessee State has told Chris Harris of WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee, that he has left operation and is at Vanderbilt medical center.
Harris has said, "They have not yet given details about the type of wound or its gravity," and they are trying to determine when the wound occurred in the Tennessee State group.
He is in his second year with red T-shirts Abercrombie, and has his first season after being transferred to Tennessee State from Illinois.
He made five plates before leaving the game on Saturday, with a total of 18 plates throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on ink when they buy goods in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on ink when they buy goods in the United Kingdom, and this amount will be used to help those who have been homeless, following the plans of the conservative party.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
For those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, there will be an increase in the tax on the timbre.
The Public Treasure believes that they will collect more £20 million per year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on ink when they buy goods in the United Kingdom, and the amount will be used to help those who have been homeless, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters; Corbyn has promised to provide housing with reasonable prices and collect more taxes to those with the most income.
The increase in the tax on ink will be for people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional amount collected will be used for efforts to reduce people sleeping on the street.
Overload, which is an addition to the tax on current ink (including high taxes for the second houses entered two years ago and purchased for the estates purchased for rent), can reach up to three per cent.
The Public Treasure believes that they will collect more than €120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the onibars built in London are purchased by those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as a result, prices rise and it is harder for those who want to buy it for the first time to enter the housing market.
The rich areas of the country, especially of the capital, have become "mamu villages", since foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the city.
This new policy comes after Boris Johnson's request to reduce the tax on the timbre to help young people buy their first home.
He has attributed large construction companies to keep the prices of the estates high, and asked May to put aside a reasonable price housing fee to solve Britain's "homelife crisis".
Corbyn has, in turn, presented some attractive reforms about housing, including rental control and "reasonless" homelessness.
In addition, the municipality wants to provide more power to build more housing.
May has said: "I said last year that I would devote my president to restore the British dream, which is to improve the life of each new generation.
That means repairing the rotten housing market.
The gates of Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize life.
However, it is not fair to buy housing as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies.
For too many people, the dream of possessing a home has gone too far, and we still have the dignity of those who have to sleep on the street."
Jack Ross: "Being a Scottish team coach is my greatest wish"
Jack Ross Sunderland's leader says that he was once his "greatest parent" coach of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, third place in League One, three points from first place.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer, after St Mir's team returned to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to act as a player for my country.
I won a B League trophy, and that was all," Ross said on the BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
"But I saw Scottish games from childhood with my father in Hampden, and I have always wanted to come back.
However, only if I had the ability to handle the club I would have had the opportunity."
Among those of Sunderland's former coaches before Ross are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss said he felt no nervousness for coming after such great names, since Barnsley and Ipswich Town had previously refused to offer training.
"To measure success, I'll have to ask myself, "Can I translate the club to the Premier League?"
Given the club's structure and facilities, it should certainly be in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as a success if I don't succeed in doing it."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, as a assistant to Dumbarton's boss at one time and one of Hearts' training workers after 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover after going down to the third level, and even thanks to him, he turned from being about to descend by St Mir's level to become champions the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Miren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a real crossroads for me, perhaps," he said about taking responsibility for Allo.
"I really thought being a coach was the best function for me than being a player.
That's funny to say, because I was a good player, I made a good living, and I lived some important moments of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot of things every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of the work, but I am happy as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever."
The full interview will be held on September 30 (Sunday) on Radio Scotland Radio Scotland at Sportsound between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST)
Five-thirty on Saturday is the best time to have a drink, according to a poll.
Thanks to the summer heatball, the income of British pubs has risen greatly, but pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
Pub- and bar chain sales have risen by 2.7 per cent, but the restaurant has dropped by 4.8% per cent, data says.
Peter Martin, who works in the CGA business advice that has collected data, says: "As the sun has been constantly struck, and England's team has lasted more than expected in the World Football Championships, the July data is similar to June, where pub income has risen by 2.8 per cent, but the restaurants have dropped even more.
Although the sales of restaurant June have dropped 1.8, they have been even worse in July.
pubs and bars specializing in drinks have had much better performance, and their rise has been greater than the drop in restaurant sales.
Pubs that specialize in food have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
People just want to have a drink.
The sales of Pub and bars have risen by 6.6% per cent in the past month, while the food has dropped by 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and social events and sports influence are the most important factors in relation to sales of trade outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains have economic embarrassments, and having a drop of 4.8 per cent of sales from year to year will cause important damage, in addition to continuing pressures around the cost.
The long and hot summer comes in an unsatisfied time for establishments specializing in food, and it is to be seen whether the moderate temperatures in August will give them relief."
The rise of sales of pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened establishments, has been 2.7 per cent in July, with the spread of chains being slowed down.

One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts on social networks that hide from parents and teachers, according to a poll.
In a poll by 20,000 students of secondary school, "false Instagram accounts" has been seen to have risen.
Because of this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account that parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
In a poll by 20,000 students in secondary school, it has been possible to see that many "false Instagram accounts" have risen (an Instagram is a photo sharing website).
Because of this news, the fear of whether sexual content is being published has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clear "main" account that parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website unintentionally, where one teenager called others "born me."
This study by Digital Awareness UK in the United Kingdom and the "Directors Conference" of independent schools (HMC), 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of it acknowledge that they have private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC: "It is a shame that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find."
Eilidh Doyle will be "atlet's spokesman" at Scottish athletics committee
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed ex-executive director of the Scottish athletic committee at this year's general meeting of the administrative board.
Doyle is Scotland's most awarded athlete, and director Ian Beattie has said that with this change they have a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of their extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world, and we know that it will be very useful for Scottish athletics to be on board," Beattie said.
Doyle has said, "I am very excited to be an athlete's spokesman, and I hope I will make a big contribution, and direct the sport in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 metres races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, and has four gold medals in total. He is currently a BBC broadcaster, who recently lost his ability to walk because of a passing ischemic heart attack that lost his ability to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was to see if I would recover or not, or to what level.
It was hard, but I've been totally restored, I had to learn to walk again, and I've been doing skill exercises today!
Thank you for the messages you sent me!"
An advertisement for a milk-offing that my mother compares to cows has created opposite opinions on the Internet.
A company of milk-related people has created opposing opinions on the Internet compared to cows that the brar has milked.
To present what is said to be "the world's first silent milk-making laptop", Elvie has released a joke advertisement inspired by consumer technology to show the freedom that the new device gives to mothers who extract milk.
Four women who are really mothers dance in a stable full of straw, with these words and a song with similar words: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't stick it up," and "Maybe you haven't noticed, but these are not rallies, but my tits."
The motto is, "Get out milk, take out milk, give them milk, take out milk, take out milk, I'm milking my girls."
However, this advertisement, which the company has posted on Facebook's page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a variety of reactions to the audience, many have said that it does not take seriously the "horrity" of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they too must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their young are stolen a few days after birth," said one user.
Elvie can be accessed discreetly in one of the breasts of breastfeeding (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else said, "Very traumatic, of course, for Mom and baby.
But, well, why not use children to advertise a milk-to-house for mothers they don't take away?"
Someone else added, "This advertisement has no kindness at all."
Others, however, have defended the announcement, that a woman has confessed that she thought it "like to burst into laughter."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still breastfeed, I'd buy one.
When I took out milk I felt like I was a cow.
The advertisement is a little crazy, but that's his goal.
It's a great product," a user wrote.
Another has commented, "It's funny, aimed at mothers who draw milk (they often have to do it in workplaces or in the bathroom), because they feel like they were "bies."
He has no intention of praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they have been dancing to milk in their breast.
Many women who draw milk are considered to feel like cows in the campaign.
Elvie's milking, however, is completely silent, and has no cable or spat. It can be taken discreetly on one of the breasts to be taken discreetly, so that women can move as they wish, be babys in their arms or get out of the street.
Ana Balarin Mother's partner and executive director has commented: "Elvie milking is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and challenging presentation.
With this similarity between women and milk cows that draw milk, we wanted to highlight the process of milk extraction and all its challenges, and likewise express the freedom of milking in an entertaining and near way.
This is not the first time Elvie has attracted attention.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the pass for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of children have been taken silently to a camp shop camp on the Texas border.
The number of emigrant children in the back has increased greatly lately, although it has been about the same monthly care on the border, one of the reasons why it has been harder to bring children to sponsors because of Trump's administration's rhetoric and harsh guidelines.
So far, paperless immigrants have been most of the sponsors themselves, but now they are afraid to name the children to protect them, as they could lose their power to stop in the US.
The risk increased in June, for federal authorities said that those who wanted to be protectors and other adults living in their home should send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenc, one of the official immigration and customs security officers in the United States, confessed to Congress that dozens of people who had requested to protect the minors who arrived without adults had been arrested.
This agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of them had no criminal precedent.
"There are nearly 80 percent of sponsors or those who live with them illegally in our country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still grasping them," said Albenc.
In order to process the situation of children faster, officers have created new rules, according to which, they must appear in court within one month after the child has been seized, and not as before in 60 days, according to the workers of shelters.
Many of them will appear in a video conference call to demand legal status from an immigration judge.
If it is decided that they are not suitable for receiving assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The more time children spend in care centers, the more opportunities there is to increase their anxiety and depression, which could result in violence anger or attempts to escape, according to the workers of shelters and reports that have been made in the system over the past few months.
Children's defenders say that these concerns increase in large facilities such as Tornillo, because it is so large that there is more probability that children's problems are ignored.
They also said that if children are taken to camp camp camp to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends without time, the trauma they already have can increase.
Syria calls for "occupant forces" in the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately
In the United Nations General Assembly, foreign affairs minister Walid al-Moualem has also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, also substitute for Prime Minister, has said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated as they are.
"They must be removed from the land immediately and unconditionally," he said on the committee.
Moualem has said that the war against terrorism in Syria has almost ended; 3600,000 people have died in that war since 2011, and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus has said that "until we clean up all the Syrian territories" and "until we clean all the lands of Syria" from terrorist groups, as well as "unlawly foreign presence".
The US has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advise Kurdish forces against President Bashar al-Assad and Syrian Arabs.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the land of the country that has been destroyed by the war.
As for the subject of refugees, Moualem has said there are appropriate conditions to return them, and has attributed some "west countries" to spread the "Irrational fear" that encourages refugees to stay outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian institutions to enable these returns," he said.
"They're politicized what's only humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until the arrival of a political agreement to end the war.
Russia and Turkey have recently made an agreement to create a shelter area in the last fortress of rebels in Idlib, which is believed by diplomats of the United Nations, it is possible to promote political dialogue thanks to it.
The Syrian forces supported by Russia avoided a large-scale attack in that province with three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem has said that the agreement has clear "limits" and has stated that military action will aim for jihadists, including Nusra front fighters related to Al-Qaeda, which will be "deusted".
The United Nations courier Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will be held soon among the members of the government and opposition to begin forming a constitution following the war, as well as to begin opening the way to elections.
Moualem has established certain conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this assembly, saying that the assembly's work must be limited to "revising articles of the current constitution", and warning that no one else should interfere.
Why Trump wins for the second time
Following this logic, Trump will gain re-election in 2020 if (a lot of democratic party audience probably expected) do not end their presidentialization process or scandals before their presidency is required.
That would be "the most dramatic ending of a presidence!"
For now, the audience doesn't seem tired.
Since 2014, the audience of the CNN network of the majority of viewers hours has nearly doubled until it reaches 1.05 million viewers, and tripled the MSNBC chain, up to 1.6 million.
Fox News, in turn, has 2.4 million viewers on that schedule, which has risen by 1.7 million since four years ago, according to Nielsen's company data. The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has the largest cable television viewer, and has achieved up to 3.5 million viewers on nights where important news occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what's going on," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC network's "designed survivor" session. After an attack has been destroyed by the Capitol, Baer's session is about a cabinet chief who becomes president.

Before the 2016 election, while he was in a taxi in Boston,
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
Scovell asked the reason.
"Because it made him laugh," said Scovell.
There is also time for entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories from Washington decide the future of abortion law, immigrants' families can regroup, and the health of the world economy.
Only high privileged spectators have the option to disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching a debate of experts on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward has used "depth savings" to write the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar oyster jacket ("skined with waste" in The Washington Post), and Stormy Daniels's funny way of describing Trump's "anatomy".
I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.

When I met with Fleis this week, he was 26 degrees and was sunny at his house on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was stuck inside the house while recording CNN.
He could not rest from television, particularly now that Brett Kavanaugh must appear before the judicial power committee of Senate, and that the future of the Supreme Court hangs.
"When I did those funny TV shows a long time ago, people used to say it was the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but apparently they were right."

External money is entering the bar in the most equal elections in the United States Congress's half-way legislatures
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, money is being barred, since the congressary distances have been reorganized, and as a result, two headlines are competing to get the same chair.
In this distance around Pittsburg, which has recently been reorganized, they represent the Democratic Party's Conor Lamb, who obtained their chair in special elections in another district.
Another headline has an opponent Lamb, which is Keith Rothfus of the Republican Party, who represents the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which is significantly overlapd with the 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated against what the constitution says in favor of Republicans. As a result of this verdict, the map boundaries were properly delined.
This new district competition has caused a close competition for campaign financing in the main funding sources of parties: the congress committee of the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the national committee of the Republican campaign (NCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania for little because he won the 18th Congress District special elections in Pennsylvania in March.
The chair was owned by a Republican in the last decade, and President Donald Trump also won the distance with a 20-point advantage.
In the words of political experts, Democrats have a little advantage.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador for being on China's side, but then backs down the decision
Diplomacyrs have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, that Washington has hardly asked them to retreat.
Trump had a polite meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners decided to drop Trump's organisation management team.
The state department's officers decided to take the American heads of diplomatic missions out of El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, following the "new decisions to leave Taiwan recognition", Heather Nauert, the department spokesman, said in an early month statement.
However, it was considered to only oppose El Salvador, which received $140 million as aid from the United States in 2017, among others, to control drug trafficking, promote development and support the economy.
Among the proposed penalties include reduction and specific visa restrictions that would be very harmful to the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officers delayed a high-level conference on safety and economic prosperity, which aimed to succeed a similar meeting in the previous year, and was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from going to the United States.
But in mid September, the senior administrators made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference, and thus announced that the consideration for punishment imposed on El Salvador had been cancelled.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to participate in the conference that has changed in mid October, a sign of the importance of administration to the meeting, in terms of diplomats.
Three American envoys have returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, with no hard messages or penalties from Washinton.
A White House spokesman in Bolton has denied making statements about the details given by three American officers about the discussion. There were two diplomats among the officers who have agreed to report internal discussions in exchange for keeping anonymity.
An analyst who is closely related to the administration and has also spoken anonymously confirmed what they said.

The report of Attorney General Robert Mueller will soon be released, which will indicate whether Trump interfered with justice, for there is much evidence of this in public point of view.
In addition, Mueller is also investigating whether Russia had been accompanied by Trump's campaign in the US election.
If most of Congress changes to parties, Trump will have to give him instructions as he prepares again to appear before voters (and, if necessary, a jury under his equals).
There are many conditions for this, however, and I do not mean Trump's inevitable decline del, nor that of Trump's European equivalents.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and according to them it will determine how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a coup against Hitler, if Western countries had held it and helped the Czechs of Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid the massacre of years following it.
We have history full of such turning points that cause the accidental progress of democracy to accelerate or delay.
Americans are currently facing a number of such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump releases the general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, Roseinsten, who controls what will happen with Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been in danger since this newspaper announced last year that he suggested recording the president secretly, and stated that the president was inappropriate for his office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times has stated is incorrect.
"How can we respond if it is not the full or fair investigation that has just been asked of the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh, or if he receives confirmation of being a judge of the Supreme Court, even if credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony have been made against him?
And above all, will we vote in a position to form a Congress that will ask Trump for responsibility in the mid-right elections?
If we don't pass these tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers feels optimistic about the competition against Rapid Vienna
Rapid will be the host of Vienna on Thursday. They know that if the Austrians defeats, they know that after an exciting draw with the Spanish Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will stay in the perfect position for qualified for the G team in the Europa League.
The centre of Graham Dorrans was unable to make his first appearance of the season by an injury suffered on his knee until the 2 and 2nd draw with Villarreals, but believes that Rangers can use this as a trap for better things.
"It was a good result, because it's a good opponent Villarreal," said the 31-year-old player.
"We played to get something, and we ended up getting a point.
Maybe we could have had the opportunity to win at the end, but it's a draw result, if necessary.
In the first half they prevailed, and the second time we were the boss.
Thursday night will be very important for the European Championship.
We hope to get three points, but it's going to be difficult, because they had a good result in the last game, yet the audience is on our side, and I hope we'll get a positive result.
Last year was difficult; I had injuries and changes were made at the club itself, but at the moment there is a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it a lot; training is also good.
I hope we will move forward, forget about the previous season and succeed."
Women are extremely concerned about a problem related to their retirement savings.
The participants in the poll knew what care they want to have, but very few have reported to their family members.
Half of those who participated in the study of Nationwide said he has spoken to his partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent have spoken about this with his children.
"We want some family member to wait for us, but we dare not ask," explained Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide insurance company.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: the family won't be willing to take care of you unless you ask him to do so first.
Aritu collaborates with a consultant and agree to where and how you want to receive care with your family, because these options will depend on the cost of care.
Ask a consultant for help: an advisor can help you find a way to pay those expenses.
You have more than one option to fund long-term care, including: regular long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay the expenses of care in cash and who can pay for insurance at the moment with their own money if you have that money.
Clear legal documents: forget legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health; also make sure that you will be cared for as you wish if professionals are unable to request it.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a reliable person on your behalf to make financial choices and, when you are unable to do so, to make sure you pay your bills.
Don't forget the details: suppose parents are old and one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died on Friday due to the strong earthquake and tsunami that the city of Palu in Indonesia suffered, and agents say the number of dead will rise.
Since communication systems are cut off, aid agents have not been able to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the closest area to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Palu.
Palun, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here is an important information about the Palu city on the island of Sulawesi and the Donggala government:
Palu is the capital of the province of South Sulawesi, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that occupies an area of more than 300 km (180 miles) that make up the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi Province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickela mining is also important in the province, but Morowalin is mostly concentrated on the coast across Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian table for managing disasters (Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management), Paluk and Dongga have suffered a large number of tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died and hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Donggalan.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred in the west of Donggala, and nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismic area called "The Pacific Fire belt", which is why it frequently suffers earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake occurred on the west coast of Aceh Province in Indonesia, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami. This tsunami shook 14 countries, and 226,000 deaths throughout the Indian Ocean coast, more than half in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred in southern Java (the island with the largest inhabitants in Indonesia), and caused a tsunami. This tsunami severely shook the southern coast, and nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the southern Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake occurred in one of the Mentawai islands near the Sumtra, and caused a tsunami at a maximum of 10 meters. As a result, dozens of villages were destroyed, and about 300 people died.
2016: A small earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya government of Aceh, and it led to disaster and fear, as people remembered the destruction caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami then, but more than 100 people died crushed by buildings.
2018: Some major earthquakes occurred among tourists on the island of Lombok in Indonesia, and more than 500 people died, particularly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested with domestic violence charges
Track Palin, son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, has been arrested with assault charges.
Palin, born 29 years old and Wasillan (Alaska) was arrested for suspecting a domestic violence case, obstructing the accusation of a domestic violence case and oppose authority, according to a report published by the Alaska State Troopers Division on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a well-known woman began to call the police to denounce the alleged crime, Palin took the phone from him.
According to KTUU, Palin is at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility center in preventative imprisonment and a $500 bailout.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he made an allegate, he said he was "untimeless, innocent," as the net reported.
Palin has been charged with three light A-level crimes, and could receive a maximum of one year's imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a light B-level crime, a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was accused of attacking.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Supreme Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, domestic attacks were accused of obstructing the accusation of a domestic violence crime and having a weapon when drunk.
His girlfriend stated that he gave him a muzzle.
When her son's aggressive attitude was associated with the disorder of post-traumatic stress caused by the experience of Iraq, Sarah Palin received strong criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have died on Friday after an earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake created a tsunami, and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are suspended, and the number of dead in the coming days is expected to rise.
The earthquake shook the centre of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeast of Jakatra, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos that show the moment of impact on social networks.
In fact, due to a beach festival in Palu, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami shook the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants special death sentence for suspect New York terrorist attack
New York federal prosecution wants death to eight people who died for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attack in New York City; the last time such a sentence was imposed for a federal crime in the state in 1953.
He believed that Saippov used a 30-year-old rental truck at Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway Avenue in Southern Manhattan; in this October attack, he had previously carried all pedestrians and bicycles.
To reason for the death sentence, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed these eight people "wantly" and that several people were seriously injured by "willing" in New York, according to the intent notice of the death penalty presented in the South District in New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible in both cases to impose a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury attributed 22 cases to Saipov, including eight charges for organized crime, which the federal prosecution usually uses in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction by motor vehicle.
The prosecutor said that the attack was supposed to be "precited and planned", as Saipov did "crudelity"; he described it.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saippov's actions caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of these people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the intent notice.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York sued a case of death.
He was then charged with the murder of two drug providers, but eventually, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York in 1953. It was then imposed on Julius and Ethhel Rosenberg, to whom a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbekistan Saipov showed no changes in the days and months after the attack.
Police said that he did not feel bad about what he had done.
According to the complaint, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to attack by watching videos of ISIS organization on his mobile.
Also, in the words of the police, he asked that they should put the flag of ISIS in the hospital room.
As for the charges of 22 crimes, he has declared himself innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for replacing Saipov, said they have "great disappointment" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that instead of accepting the guilt of guilt for the prison sentence without possibility of release will only prolong trauma to people who have experienced the impact of these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor not to ask the tax for the death penalty.
A Conservative Party parliamentary member says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of negotiations on Brexit
Nigel Farage has ordered "mobilizing the people's army" today at the Conservative Party conference protest.
UKIP party leader has said that politicians need to feel the "hot" of Eurosceptics, and Theresa May's parliamentarians have proposed this to take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative parliamentarian Peter Bone has explained to participants of the Birmingham march, the United Kingdom would have been "outside" if Mr. Farage was already the secretary of Brexit.
But conservatives in favour of staying have organized a protest against Brexit in the city, and noted the challenge Mrs. May faces: to reconcile the completely distributed rows again.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue the Chequers commitment plan, but in between Brexit supporters, supporters of staying and EU attacks.
The Allies believe it will continue and try to reach an agreement with Brussels apart from such reactions, and force Europeans and husband to decide between his offer or "caos".
As Mr. Bone explained to the participants in the march of Leave Means Leave, which took place in Solihull, he wants to "fire the Chequers".
He also stated that he had to collaborate with Mr. Farage and that he should be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was careful, we'd be out already," he said.
Wellingborough party parliamentarian added, "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to fire Chequers."
Indicating opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The British have changed their ideas and want to stay is a lie."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and supporters of Brexit, also went to the march, and explained to the correspondents, "I have only: Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not known among the people, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not known among our party members, nor among our activists who shake the streets and make it possible to win elections.
Get rid of Chequers and start listening."
Turning to Mrs. May, he added: "The Prime Ministers, to continue to have a job, must keep their word.
Mr. Farage told those who participated in the demonstration, politicians must be forced to feel "hot" if they are going to betray their decision in the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between our (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today so they know we won't let them out with theirs."
Turning to the public full of enthusiasm, he added: "I want you to make our political class feel heat about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of citizens who gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud."
Meanwhile, supporters of staying walked through Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A few activists raised posters against Brexit after this weekend's group lunch.
Adonis, a working member, laughed at the conservatives for their security problems with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can get to function properly, and in Ireland the whole of Canada plus plus chain technology, of unlimited free trade," he added.
"It's a big lie.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren will examine the possibility of "with great care" as a presidential candidate
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "with great care" examine the possibility of becoming a presidential candidate after the November elections.
The Boston Globe has reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke of his future at the plenary meeting that formed at the western Massachusetts City Hall on Saturday.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will be nominated for re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican Party's state representative; Diehl Trump was Vice President of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is said that Trump's place may be taken in 2020.
The incident at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting with his colleagues as a full meeting in the City Hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked him if he intended to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and for that, a woman must be in power."
A suspect was arrested for shooting that caused Sims' death at Louisiana State University
Police at Baton Rouge, Luisiana, announced on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect for his shooting that caused the death of basketball player Wayde Sims at Louisiana State University.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported in the news conference that took place at 11:00 (East Time) at 11 a.m., the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson.
Before that, he opened a video of Friday shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in it.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed on Friday morning near the southern university camp.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound in his head, and as a result he eventually died," explained Police Chief Murphy J. Paul to Saturday through the 247sports network.
Wayde got involved in a conflict trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and admitted that he had been there, having a gun in his hand and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested and taken to prison without incident to the State Police Department of Baton Rouge in eastern Baton Rouge.
He grew up in almost two-foot Sims Baton Rouge, played 32 10-star games in the last season, and 17.4 minutes of play, on average of 5.6 points and 2.9 bounces per match.
Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton won the world title after winning Sebastian Vettel
It became clear that since Valtteri was ranked before Bottas Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes team's orders would be dead or alive in the race.
From the beginning, Bottas was fine, and almost fired Hamilton into the first two to defend his place, and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first entered the boxes, and Hamilton had to get into traffic at the end of the trumpet, which should have had a direct effect on the race.
Mercedes entered the boxes a round later, and followed Vettel from it, but after a competition Hamilton advanced him, for in the competition, he let the interior free after a double movement to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, began the race in the last row of the exit grill, and finished his first tour in seventh place.
Next, he remained in first place in large part of the race, and by the end he held the tires to finish the race quickly and to advance Kimi Raikkon and get fourth place.
Eventually, he entered the boxes on tour 44, but was unable to live the pace at eight remaining two, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day; Valtteri has done a great job all weekend, and it was really honest.
The team did a great job in the competition," Hamilton said.
They were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein during a demonstration held on Saturday for highlighting that he had not leaked the letter of Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
When Virginia spoke in a demonstration held in the West, the president did not make a direct reference to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "bad, false and lying".
"The only thing that could happen, and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last few days, that you see anger, that you see people who are angry, you see people who are evil, false, and lying," he said.
"You see the lighting and leaks and say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Remember his answer? Have you leaked the letter? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Have we leaked the letter? No, we didn't leak it," he added, imitating the senator's reaction.
The letter explaining the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh went by Ford to Feinstein in July, and leaked last September, but Feinstein has denied that the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations; I haven't leaked his story," Feinstein explained to the Committee, The Hill has reported.
"He asked me to keep him quiet, and I kept him secret, as he had asked for."
But the fact that he denied it was not welcome on the President's side, who stated in the demonstration that was held on Saturday night, "I'll tell you: they were inappropriate gestures.
Maybe it wasn't him, but they were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen."
Following the defense of the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of inappropriate sexual attitudes by three women, the president stated that Democrats are using their allegations for their own purposes.
"They are willing to do anything to restore power.
They are evil, it doesn't matter who they hurt, who is to step on to get power and control," said the president, as the Mediaite site has reported.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars recovered on Saturday the Elite league match he lost against Belfast Giants, having won 5-3 for the second chance match played in Dundee.
Giants began to win, with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a draw, but Giants soon recovered his leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought a draw back to Dundee, and eventually both goals of Luke Lundvald Nielsen supported him for victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite league of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who lost 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the two teams season, and Giants won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's openinger arrived in the fourth minute, in 3:35 minutes, thanks to Kendall McFaull's support, and four minutes later David Rutherford helped Beauvillier, who doubled the marker.
It was a lively beginning, for Sullivan led to a draw in 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie and he scored in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer wanted to make sure Giants came to the first break with the marker on his side, and at the end of the first part he scored his second goal of the night.
But the family reorganized and Bouchard brought a draw again by putting the goal in 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second part, Cownie and Charles Corcora worked together to help Nielsen and give Dundee a leader for the first time in the match, and at the end of the end, they brought the fifth goal and, with it, they brought victory to the team.
The players of the Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, will play their game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air controller killed hundreds of passengers on a plane to escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after making sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers could properly air and die.
More than 800 people have died and many others are missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday and causing a tsunami.
Many strong replicas have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunwan Agung refused to leave his position and leave the control tower of Mutia Sis Al Jufri Airport.
On the other hand, he stayed there to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air was properly aired, which was on the track at that moment.
Next, he jumped off the control tower when he saw that he was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for air navigation in Indonesia, said that thanks to this decision, hundreds of lives were saved, as the ABC News site in Australia has reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palura.
"Our hearts break when they hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the death rate will rise to thousands of people, and the Indonesian table for disaster management says that access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are limited.
"It is believed that the tasa will still grow, because many bodies are still under ruins, and we have not been able to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the table.
The waves at most six feet have completely destroyed Palu; on Sunday there will be massive burials there.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing support and supplies.
35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma explained to Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance full of corpses arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food in small markets."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is working as quickly as possible to help those who survived, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The Indonesian President Game Widodo arrived at Palura on Sunday, and explained to the military members of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" told CNN.
Another earthquake has also shaken Indonesia this year, which occurred in Lombok, and more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crash that occurred in a lake
The airline that operated the flight that fell on a Mediterranean Pacific lake now says a man is missing after 47 passengers and crews had been successfully evacuated.
Air Niugini said in a publication, it was not until Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said he is working with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to journalists who asked for further details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to local boats, they were able to rescue the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while landing at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agents said on Friday, seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and all in a stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the US army have said that the plane fell on the lake near the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane got very low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers easily arrived in the water that reached the emergency radios of the sinking plane to their waists.
He said the cabbages were scared and that they were rioting, and that he suffered a small wound in his head.
The U.S. Army said that the support of fishermen who were working around the pier was also very helpful in rescue work, for which a pizzible vessel was used to bring passengers to the ground before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG for the last two decades, but none have been due to Air Niugini.
An analyst completes the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analytic Paul Rowlett, an analyst in the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
As he presented to the jury, he used mobile phone records to connect the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and Jessica Chambers the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers died in the night the woman died.
Rowlett said that she received location data from several mobile phones showing that she was with Tellis Chambers in the evening she died, so she contradicted Tellis' previous assertion, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis's mobile phone was with Chambers just as Tellis said his friend was with Michael Sanford, then the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday, and testified that he was not in the village that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "in lies" by Sanford, "because the truck was in Nashville."
There was another inconherence: Tellis said he had known him two weeks ago when Chambers died.
According to mobile phone records, however, they only met a week ago.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers text messages, calls and contact information from the phone.
"He erased it from life," said Hale.
The defense will start on Sunday with the latest alleges.
The judge said that the trial will pass from the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-hop conscious?
A trio of hip-hop music wants to challenge people who have a negative opinion about the kind of music, and for that they will fill their music with positive messages.
Bristol's High Breed group says hip-hop music has abandoned political messages and social problems struggle.
They want to return to its roots, and make the conscious hip-hop known again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently seen the revival of such hip-hop in the United Kingdom, through artists Acala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York nurse accuses a couple of people to release him after a "ractist" message.
A New York nurse has accused a couple of people after receiving a message from her mother who said it wasn't because of a mistake to discriminate and release it was "another black".
The couple denied that he is racist, stating that the accusation is "too much".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, was surprised to take care of the children when he found out that Giselle Maurice was black, when Maurice arrived home on her first working day in 2016.
"EEEEEEEEEEZ, Another BELTZ," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice.
According to the New York Post, when he noticed his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "diserful" and fired Miss Maurice, the previous nurse, who was African-American, said that she was not a good worker and instead expected a Filipino nurse.
He paid Miss Maurice for that single working day, and asked for an Uber to take her home.
Maurice has now accused the couple, and has asked him for compensation for damages caused by dismissal, including $350 for six months a day, for although he was initially hired to live at home and take care of it for six months.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," he explained to the Post newspaper on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied that he is racist, and said that his dismissal Maurice was reasonable and necessary because he was afraid they could not trust him after they had insulted him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to tell him.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco explained to the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have insulted, even if you were due to a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Don't even think about it."
In explaining that the accusation was "no" for that reason, Plasco said that his wife had had less than two months ago and that she was "in a difficult situation".
"Will you be looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investment bank.
The legal case is still in progress, and the public opinion court has quickly denounced the couple on social networks, punishing him for his attitude and logic.
They feared Paddington's publisher would not like a bear speaking to readers, a new letter has shown
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put it in the place of someone who read it for the first time before the book was published.
It's so funny to know what we know about Paddington's great success now."
His father was a BBC cameraman thanks to a small toy bear before he was inspired to write the children's book; his daughter said his father had an optimistic attitude because people rejected his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "good taste" because he died last year.
As for Paddington, he says he was "an important member of the family," and his father was finally proud.
"He was a silent man, and he was not vain," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he almost felt like he was a child who gets something: you feel proud of it, even though it was not your achievement in itself.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington more or less.
Although it was the creation of him and his imagination, he always acknowledged merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
As soon as he landed, his daughter was quickly taken to Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, but doctors could do nothing to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was very serious, that he did not think he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell him that he would die in the next two minutes and say I had to say hello to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors had given him to keep beating their hearts and were gradually leaving his system.
He died a little earlier than he thought, and ready, it was over.
I could just sit down and wait, knowing that everything would start there.
I couldn't cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had since been disappointed by the death of her daughter, went up on the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting the grief she felt.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"My head was bent, and tears came down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Some upset women put posters on a bridge to prevent people from killing themselves.
Two women who have lost people who loved it as a result of suicide want to avoid taking their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put posters on a Welsh bridge, which have positive messages and phone numbers so that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to have depression, and killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney; he said, his son had a special gift for cooking, and had an infectious smile.
"They all knew him for the smile.
They always said his smile brightened anywhere."
However, he quit his job before his death, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother discovered his brother after he took his life away from himself.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created some posters, "to let people know there are people who can tell you what happens to you and can help you, even if they are a friend.
Don't be quiet; you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, who also lost his partner for 15 years after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his attitude.
He was devastated on Christmas Day; when the children opened their gifts, he did not even look at them."
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to move on: "He leaves a grave in the family.
It makes us down.
But we all have to keep going and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in turmoil after FBI investigation begins
"I thought, if we could achieve something like what he asked for, such as a study of limited time or limited district, we might perhaps get a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and added that he feared that the Committee was "disting" in the face of the obstacles caused by passionate parties.
Why didn't the FBI want Mr. Kavanaugh to investigate the case and his republican followers?
The opposite opinion is because of time.
It is only five weeks before the middle term elections: they will be on November 6.In them, Republicans are expected to achieve bad results, and if so, they will begin a race to leave the chosen man for the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has made numerous telephone calls to senators, and has put pressure on Mr. Kavanaugh to support Mr. Kavanaugh, for Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit at this point.
It is not yet clear that Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, Vice President Mike Pence could break the draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has been "down" since Kim is in power.
The number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Joint Department, said there had been 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 refugees who had been in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and putting greater fines on person dealers has had a major impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Nearly all North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest limit to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the demilitarized area between the two Koreans with severe protective measures (DMZ).
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants, not as refugees, and often repatriated by force.
North Korea and South Korea are still in war by themselves, two of them have improved significantly in recent months.
In early a month, the leaders of both countries met Pyongyangen to discuss negotiations on the suspended denuclearization.
Before June, a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to a Korean peninsula without nuclear.
But on Saturday, Ri Yong-ho, the Minister of External Affairs of North Korea, accused the fines placed by the US that he had not made any progress since.
"If we have no confidence in the U.S., we will not trust our national security, and that way we will not leave our weapons first," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly held in New York.
Nancy Pelos has told Brett Kavanaugh that he is "hiserical" and is not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelos, the leader of the minority in the Chamber, has told the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, and that he is not ready to be in the Supreme Court as far as genius is concerned.
Pelosi made his comments in an interview on Saturday, which was held at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had ever acted like that, you would have said it was "histeric," Pelosos said; that was his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Judicial Senate Committee.
Kavanaugh denied having sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
In his initial speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he would almost shout and stammer when he talked about his family and youth.
He also explicitly denounced the board Democrats, and said that the allegations against him are "organized and offensive" organized by liberals who are angry at Hillary Clinton's losing their 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he cannot be in the Supreme Court because he has shown that he has an impartial opinion against Democrats.
"With these agreements and his attitude against the Clintons and Democrats, he has been excluded from the league," he said.
Pelos objected if Kavanaugh was chosen and the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives when asked if he would oppose him.
"I will say, 'If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court, not to be in the court right now," Pelos said.
He is currently a judge of the Court of Appeals of the Kavanaugh D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, Kavanaugh is concerned about the judgments that Kavanaugh will oppose the law of available health care or Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the confirmation court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would turn back some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"A hysterical and impartial person cannot go to court and expect us to take it well," Pelosos said.
And women must order it.
It's a fair speech; a terrible rage for months and years, and he can't let go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do I?"
He continued, "A woman who was an executive from somewhere helped me terribly, and she told me she too cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique: when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person who was talking to her, "As I speak of tears, you may think I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Tears are not poorly seen to express rage because they are partly poorly interpreted.
I remember something that happened to me in one of my first jobs, most of them were in an office where I was once crying in rage, and a more mature woman grabbed me by the neck. She was a cold boss I had a little fear from the beginning, she took me to the top of the stairs.
"Never let you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understood you."
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democrat assembly member of Kolorado, and worked with Gary Hart in his presidential race.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a ship called Monkey Business and found out that he had a love affair with another woman who was not his wife and refused to race, Miss Schroeder decided to be the same presidential candidate.
"It wasn't a well thought decision," he said laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "White Edurne and the Seven gnomes".
As the campaign began a long time ago, he was still collecting money, so he decided he would not enter the race until $2 million was collected.
The fight was lost.
He learned that some followers who gave men $1,000 only gave them $250.
"Do they think I'm disappointed?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and reported that he would not campaign official, he was very moved: he was very moved: his gratitude for the people who protected him, instead of money and representatives, had made it so difficult to collect the frustration of the system, and the anger of sexist attitudes.
"You must have thought I was very nervous," Miss Schroeder explained about the reaction of the press seeing her attitude.
"You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
"Did he cry?"
Commercial wars between the US and China could benefit Beijing
The salvations that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the US and China were buzzing, and although there is a lively conflict, the cracks between countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning early in the year, then imposed a tax on major products that China exported, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant increase has arrived this week, as new rates that will affect products worth $200 billion (150 billion francs) will apply to half of the goods that will be transported from China to the US.
Beijing has applied represalis every time, and the last rate has been to raise between five and ten percent per cent to Americans who are worth 60 billion dollars.
China has said it will equalize each U.S. rise, and the second strongest economy in the world will not change the blink so easily in mind.
Asking Washington to turn back would lead to a lawsuit, but publicly yielding to the US would be more shameful for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing did well, pressures for commercial war in the United States could benefit China in the long run, which would decrease dependence between the two economies.
"The quickly decision-making by politicians in Washington or Beijing would create conditions for economic latchin in some two countries. This is more dangerous than observers thought before," said researcher Abigail Grace, along with several other experts studying Asia in the New United States Security Centre.
Syria is "presed" for refugees to return, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said
Syria says it is ready to return voluntarily for refugees who wish to return, and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of External Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the state of the country is improving.
"Today the situation in it is more stable and safer thanks to the advances in the anti-terrorism process," he said.
The government continues to re-establish areas destroyed by terrorists to return to normal as soon as possible.
Now it is a good situation for refugees who wish to return voluntarily to return to the country where they had to leave terrorism and their daily lives and maintenance difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government will be greatly grateful for the help of reconstructing the destroyed country.
But he noted that he will not accept the support of countries that supported the conditional or rebels.
Europe receives the Ryder Cup victory held in Paris
After defeating the US team with 0.5 points in the last marker, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at the outside Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The US has lost six times in European soil in a row, and has not won the Ryder Cup cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
The star Phil Mickelson of the United States had passed almost badly throughout the tournament, and threw the exit stroke into the water in the 16th hole in part 3, so he passed the witness to Francesco Molina.
The Italian golf player Milinari was greatly noted at all shifts, and since the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979 he became one of the four players who had ever achieved 5, 0 and 0 results.
Jordan Spieth achieved 5 and 4 results and stayed outside against the worst player in the European team: Danish singer Thorbjorn Oles.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, achieved 2 and 1 results against the Kingdom Ian Poulter, and reached the Ryder Cup final.
Sergio García, who participated in eight Ryder Cup cups, became the leading European winner of the tournament with 25.5 race points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
So he thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy, very happy, in fact, to get the cup back.
This is teamwork, and I am happy that I have been able to help," said García, moved, after the victory of Europe.
He has passed the witness to the Spanish John Ram, who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods (2 and 1) in Sunday's individual game.
"I am very proud to have defeated Tiger Woods; I grew up seeing this man," said Rahm, 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost the four games he played in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and has a record of 3 results in Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics, for one of the best players ever, who won 14 major titles, only over Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend looking for a solution to this situation except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Fury, the U.S. captain, said because of the band's bad game, "I'm proud of my boys; they've tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a moment.
It didn't work out.
Bejondeiola to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We'll meet again, I'll collaborate with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm very proud to be their captain.
We must accept failure.
We're out."
