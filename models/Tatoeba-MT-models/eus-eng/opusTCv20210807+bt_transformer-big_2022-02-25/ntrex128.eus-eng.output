Members of the Welsh assembly have expressed their concerns that they will be "considered a puppet"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed displeasure after hearing a suggestion to change the name of their office as MWP (Member of the Welsh Legislative Assembly).
This idea has arisen after plans have been developed to change the name to the Welsh Legislative Assembly.
Members of the political assembly are worried that this plan is a good way to mock them.
A Labour Party member in the Assembly has said, "That new name rhymes with English, Twp and Pwp."
If you're from outside Wales: in Wales, twp means "fool" and pwp means "fuck".
For his part, a member of the Scottish assembly has said that the whole team "is not very happy" and suggested that they look for alternate names.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales has also said that the name "is open" to new ideas, but also expressed his concerns about the rhymes that could lead to MWP changes.
In order to better understand this conflict, it must be considered that both the Welsh letter w and the English letter u have a similar accent.
On the other hand, the committee, which is creating a legal draft for name changes, has said, "As far as the members are concerned, they will be responsible for choosing the descriptives they wish to use."
According to the Welsh government's 2017 Act, the Welsh assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the selection of suggested proposals and, in general, the name Law in Wales received numerous declarations of solidarity.
With regard to the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Members of the Welsh Legislative Assembly or WMP (in English letters), but the MWP name was chosen most often in a public consultation.
Assembly members, on the other hand, suggest alternative options, but it can be extremely difficult to choose a unanimous option; particularly for Assembly presidents, Elin Jones, who has been forced to submit a draft in a few weeks with the changes.
However, the legislation of the changes that will be made affects the functioning of the assembly; among other things, rules will be created to prevent activities that would result in the loss of a good name to the members of the Assembly and the design of the system of the assembly will be handled with the assistance of that law.
When discussing the change in legislation, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to make a sweeping decision with respect to their names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether or not to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
This popular vote has been organized to resolve the long-standing issue of the last decades with Greece (which has a province called Macedonia).
The government of Athens has long stressed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and repeatedly prevented its request to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is an opponent of the plebiscite to change his name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev), say it is only a price to pay to enter the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's church bells lose their voice due to problems with Harlem churches
"I've talked to a lot of older people and they say you could find a bar and a church in every corner long ago," Mr. Adams points out.
Today, there is nothing."
He says it's normal for Tabernacles to disappear.
"People use other methods of socializing," he explains.
"Tabernacles are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people used to meet."
As for churches, he is worried that the money he gets for the sale of his assets will not be enough and that "We'll be back at the starting point sooner or later."
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and neighboring sanctuaries will be built full of people who don't care.
"People who will buy property houses will be white people," he says, "and that is why these churches will shut down fast because these new people are not members of the churches' congregations."
The two churches were built by white people's congregations before a black Harlem metropolis; they were the Metropolitan community of 1870 and were built by St. Martin's a decade later.
In 1930, the original Methodist congregation left the neighborhood.
After that, a black people's congregation took over the relay.
Reverendo John Howard Johnson's black congregation took over St. Martin's Church; Howard organized a boycott against 125 commercial street shops in Harlem that did not hire or raise black people.
As a result of a fire in 1939, the church was badly damaged, but Father Johnson's parishioners designed a number of plans to rebuild the church and commissioned the carillon to be assembled.
Reverendo David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir of St. Martin, called the carillon "the bells of the needy people".
The expert who struck the carillon in July gave it another name: "Culture's Treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, has also stated that she was the first carillon hit by a black musician worldwide; the musician, Dionisio A. Lind, went to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather explains that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In recent months, St. Martin has seen the troublesome departures of a number of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by lay leaders or by the diocese of a bishop.
The parish council (a council of brokerage consisting of laity leaders), on the other hand, in July sent a letter to the diocese to verify that the hirings of these persons "will pass on the costs incurred" to the parish because the parish has nothing to do with the hirings of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some churches have filed their own complaints about the lack of transparency that the diocese has had.
A shark injures a 13-year-old when he was looking for oysters in the Californian sea.
According to police, on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while searching for oysters on the coast of Californa on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack came just before 7 a.m. on Beacon beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel's statement to the San Diego channel KSWB-TV, he was swimming with friends on Saturday morning for half an hour, but his friend heard him scream and ask for help; he then swam with a group of people to help his friend out of the water.
Hammel first thought that he was screaming for joy at the discovery of his friend's oyster, but then realized that the friend was shouting "I've been bitten!"
They bit me!
'I could see his whole clavicle,' said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there's a shark!" Hammel explained.
The boy has been taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is serious.
It was not possible to detect the species of shark that attacked it.
Captain Larry Giles of the Lifeguard fellowship has filed a report in front of the media and said that a shark has been sighted a few weeks earlier, but the species was determined not to be dangerous.
Giles has also stated that the victim's injuries are at the top of his body.
Police have closed access from Pontus beach in Casablad to Swami beach in Encinitas so they can conduct a 48-hour investigation and ensure people's safety.
Giles explained that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans to enter the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken over Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams stores and now offers beauty departments in the style of large stores with a variety of skilled and specialized staff.
While sales of fashion and home products are falling, £2.8 billion has been invested in the beauty sector in the United Kingdom, which is growing indefinitely; larger beauty departments will be built and tested in 11 stores in the country.If the results are good, they will be opened in more stores the following year.
Thanks to investments in beauty, supermarkets can take advantage of televisions, microwaves, and department stores selling household products.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, their beauty products offering will double and offer more than 3000 products; it will also place Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands under the jurisdiction of customers.
As for the L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees brands, they will have more room in marked areas, like areas that can be found in Boot stores.
Furthermore, the supermarket once again introduces its "Boutique" brand makeup, which is a completely vegan product; younger buyers are increasingly demanding such products.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will try the tenders offered by the perfumer at two Sainsbury's supermarket stores; the first opened last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, will open at the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and the tendency to buy food every day in small local stores, supermarkets have to work head-to-head and ears to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, has said that the selling points will take the style of large retailers and that the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of Aldi and Lidl competitors offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores and opened several Habitats after both chains were purchased two years ago, which is why food sales have been solidified and the chains purchased are more profitable than ever.
The supermarket tried to re-open the beauty and medicine departments, but the strategy failed.
He then joined Sainsbury's Boots in early 2000, but that partnership ended because the process of splitting profits in supermarket drug departments became a piece of paper.
A new strategy was set up when Sainsbury's supermarket sold its 281-density medical business to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The Lloyds chain will have a function in the organized plan: it will add a large range of luxury skin care brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's supermarkets said, "We have improved the look of beauty departments so that our customers can find perfect environments.
We have also hired experienced staffers to give specific advice in relation to products.
We have designed our own range of brands to meet all requirements and, thanks to comfortable environments and locations, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy choice in front of shops that use outdated methods."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits bid for £11 million
Dragons Den program star Peter Jones went "frightened" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby turned down an offer of £11 million related to the Forever brand business because she wants to focus full attention on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV companies.
Willoughby has no time for the Truly brand that sells home products and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The presenters of This Morning, 37, used Instagram to present his resignation.
As a result of Holly Willoughby's resignation to accept the contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, Dragons" Den's program star Peter Jones was furious at the last minute for leaving the high profit business that had been created between them.
According to our sources, there was a tense meeting on Tuesday at the Marlowe main sede and, as a result, Jones was "extremely upset" when he heard the explanation of our most famous woman on television that she would accept new £1.5 million contracts and therefore no longer be able to spend more time on the Truly brand's domestic products and components.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and has doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, after he stated on Instagram that he was leaving the Truly brand business, Jones left the United Kingdom to go to a holiday home.
One source said, "That choice has always been among Holly's priorities.
Thanks to this decision, the future of the next two decades will be guaranteed.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us a full mouth.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday; just when the brand's offer was about to close.
Moreover, the warehouse of the Marlowe residence is full of products to be sold."
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of pounds by the departure of the presenter of This Morning programme (which is the most profitable broadcaster in the United Kingdom); the company has invested a lot of money in a variety of products (including cushions, candles, clothing and household products) and will now have to deal with the delays that can arise.
This can be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have three children and have been best friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp founded the brand Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The two couples always arrange their holidays together and Jones has 40 per cent of Baldwin's TV production.
Willoughby will be an ambassador for the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV channel program I'm A Celebrity.
A source from Jones' team last night stated that he "wouldn't say anything about his business activities."
A tough conversation, yes, but then "we fell in love"
He joked about the bad things he had to suffer because of the media, all for making a "deeply inappropriate" comment about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
Trump has used his own "teacher-presenter" voice to respond in chats:
"I didn't give anything."
After the first meeting in Singapore in June, President Trump said that Kim wants to arrange a second meeting and, by doing so, a hugely important step has been taken in the path of nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has been halted.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's chief diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the UN world leaders: At the general meeting on Saturday, North Korea has not seen "a satisfactory response" from the United States in relation to the country's steps in the path of nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the sanctions imposed by the United States have been tightened in order to keep the country in pressure.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more positive outlook and has expressed such in his recent speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever," he said.
"Besides, we were about to declare war with North Korea."
Millions of people could be killed by this war.
But now, we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
In addition, he said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in good results; among other things, tests with the missiles are over, processes for releasing the hostages have been improved, and the postponement of the rest of the US military is underway.
He also explains his unusual point of view in regards to his conversations with Kim.
"It's a terrible job for the president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to enter the country by force, we have 200 people here," he said while pointing to the personal gathered in it.
Indonesia tsunami and earthquake destroys an island and leaves hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, support from non-profit international organizations was not necessary.
Although 10 per cent of the population of Lombok was displaced, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (which is a precondition for nation support).
"In a number of cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said it did not need international assistance, so this is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung says.
The Save the Children organization is forming a group that will go to Palura, but it does not yet know if volunteers can work in the country.
According to what Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the agency for national disasters, said, Indonesian officers are working in Palu to be able to accept the support of international agencies.
Despite several earthquakes in Indonesia, the country has underdeveloped measures to combat the fury of nature.
Anti tsunami fortifications have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few fortifications on the coast.
Palu doesn't have a siren to warn people and, although the warning is on, maybe that's why so many died.
When the weather is good, traveling between islands in Indonesia can be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters complicate efforts to implement logistics.
A hospital ship to provide treatment for the earthquake victims was anchored in Lombok and now goes to Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo's campaign was based on projects to improve infrastructure in Indonesia and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, the funds have been reduced and President Joko's administration is in dire straits as it prepares for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko also has trouble controlling the pull of the Indonesia sects; for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken a more conservative view of the religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have lost their homes because Christian and Islamic flags have taken their battles to the streets, including using machetes, bows, arrows, and similar weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge draw-goal vs. Chelsea
On Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, thanks to Daniel Sturridge's goal in the 89th minute, Liverpool's survival was declared a loss in the Premier League match against Chelsea.
Thanks to Xherdan Shaqiri's pass from 30 yards to Chealsea, Sturridge had a chance to change the scoreboard 1-0.
Before the ball kicked into the doorpost, he turned it to his left.
Thanks to this kick, the ball flew to the area and started to the top right of the net.
In the end, the ball overcame the backing of Kepa Arrizabalaga and went into the net.
"As players like Shaq are always playing at the top, I wanted to get that position so I could get the ball, so I tried to get enough time," Sturridge said at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and, with one touch, I had the ball at my feet; after that I didn't have too much time to think: I just took the chance."
Belgian star Eden Hazard, after scoring a goal in the 25th minute, Chelsea were winning 1-0 in the middle of the game.
During this play, the blue team's frontman returned a heel pass to Matthew Kovacic, who spun in midfield and ran into the centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic had been lecturing in the middle of the field.
Then he gave the ball a huge blow to Hazard's foot in the area.
Hazard passed the other team's defense and slammed the ball into the gate's post net with a blow to the left foot that destroyed Liverpool's defence of Alisson Becker.
Liverpool's next fight will be with Napoles, during the Champions League's group stage at 15:00 p.m., Wednesday, at the San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
On the other hand, Chelsea will face the Videoton club in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00, Tuesday, in London.
Indonesia death toll rises to 832 due to tsunami
The disaster agency said on Sunday that Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have raised the number of dead to 832.
According to press conference representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, after suffering waves of magnitude 7.5 earthquake and height of 20 feet on Friday, several people have been trapped among the ruins of buildings.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, was filled with the remains of buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing and killing a woman.
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found with stab wounds at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street; for now, a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the prime suspect of the murder.
The police have asked the people in the neighborhood to call the police if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Brian O'Hagan has said, "The investigation is just beginning, but if anyone has seen or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we would love to get in touch with you.
We also want to ask for help from drivers in cars that can make recordings, including taxi drivers, as there may be vital information recorded for the investigation."
On the other hand, a police representative has confirmed that the woman found was living in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside a house.
That afternoon, several people who know the woman have arrived at the site of the incident to find out where the body found in the morning was located.
As the investigation continues, the police will be contacted by the victim's family.
A taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tries to enter his apartment, but the police tell him that no one can enter the building or get out of it.
After hearing about what happened, he was stunned.
Neighbors will have to wait a few hours before they can enter their homes.
A fellow police officer was talking to a neighbor and was stating that the entire area would be taken as the place of the murder.
Later, a woman appeared crying.
He kept saying, "This is scary."
At 2 p.m., the two police patrol cars entered the police line and another patrol was out.
Several police officers searched the building's apartments.
Anyone with information can send a message to the DM @MerPolCC account, call 101 or call anonymously to the Crimestoppers' phone number (0800 555 111); it simply has to cite the registry 247 of 30 September.
State of Parliament Cromwell becomes final target of trend to rewrite history
If it disappears, there will be poetic justice: as the Taliban destroyed so many religious objects, so did the Puritan fanatics in England with the many historical and cultural objects of the country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "brave nonsense" and that he is "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, representative of the Cromwell Society, said: "The controversy arising from the removal of Oliver Cromwell's statues outside Westminster Palace is inevitable; Cromwell has become an objective.
Cromwell himself has never demanded or organized the iconoclasms of civil wars in England.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
The stunning depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is part of the opinions of the 19th century and our historiography; several people still believe that this person's actions should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph newspaper: "No fewer people than in the 19th century believe this, yes, but there are still many people who believe that Cromwell was a defender of parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about monarchy.
The substance of historical debates will remain whether or not that person's representation is accurate.
However, we can safely say that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has been the starting point for the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties involved in that starting point.
That he had the title of "Lord Protector" may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all his achievements."
A pig kills a Chinese farmer.
A pig has attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man with the last name "Yuan" has been found dead; his body had a cut artery and was soaked in blood in a pigsty of the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the hog breeder prepares to insert pigs into Xining in China's Qinghai province.
Usually, on Wednesdays he travels from Yunnan province with his cousin to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body of the dead man and saw that the next door to the pigsty was open.
He also stated that there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
The court analysis report confirms that it was the 550 pound pig that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and crushed" explained his cousin in the Guiyang Evening News, whose last name is "Wu".
According to security camera footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. (Thursday) to feed the pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
According to a market boss told the Evening News, the pig is locked down to prevent further attacks and allow the police to gather evidence of the site.
Yuan's family and the market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, attacks on some pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in the Massachusetts bastion, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of £650 had surrounded a Welsh peasant in his tractor until the man's wife was driven away by the animal.
In 2012, a farmer's pig in Oregon ate his body, and then a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, that can function as an "activator".
"They love to play.
They're like children and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's minor storms will leave rainfall in the southwest United States
Depending on the weather, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flows into the cold waters of the northern Mexican coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa will produce winds of 85 miles per hour, and become a Category 1 hurricane. according to Eastern Time, on Sunday, she was found 385 miles from Punta Eugenia in southwestern Mexico.
They are expected to march north to Rosa on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure point is rising in the Pacific Ocean and moving east to the west coasts of the United States.On Monday, Rosa Baja will move to California's mainland in a tropical storm and bring tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Additionally, on Monday Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to some parts of Mexico.
After that, tropical moisture will be combined with low-pressure point and heavy rainfall will result in the coming days in the southwest.
In local places, 1-4 inch water can be dangerous because sudden floods, debris streams, and landslides can arise in the desert.
Rainfall generated by high tropical humidity can leave 2-3 inches of water per hour and in particular places; particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to collect 2-4 inch of water in the southwest, particularly in Arizona.
Because tropical rainfall is erratic, it can cause sudden flooding and disturbed conditions.
It is not recommended to go for a walk in the desert if a tropical storm warning has been issued.
Rain showers can turn rocks into violent streams and storms can bring gusty winds and dust.
Also, as pressure will lower, there will be local rainfall along the southern coasts of California.
Because of the rain it is possible to collect half an inch of water and possibly create small streams of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the region's rainy season.
Also, on Sunday and Monday, some scattered tropical rain may occur in Arizona, but there will be more rainfall on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, rain showers will go to the Four Corners and expire until Wednesday.
October can have severe temperature changes in the United States as Arctic lands cool, but the tropics' warm temperatures will remain.
Sometimes these temperatures change over short distances.
As an example, on Sunday there will be major temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a nearly 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the warmth of summer will arrive and spread everywhere.
The central and eastern United States will have temperate October; temperatures will be 80 degrees from the southern fields to the north-northwest.
Also, on Tuesday there may be 80 degrees in New York; approximately 10 degrees above average temperature.
According to long-term weather forecast, the eastern United States will experience higher temperatures than average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's declaration
More than 20 million people watched Tuesday's sixth channel news of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh's and Christine Blasey Ford's shocking declarations; the latter accused Kavanaugh of sexual abuse experienced in 1980.
Meanwhile, political conflict continued and the channel's broadcasters suspended Friday's broadcast programming to give a last-minute news story: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake agreed to conduct a one-week investigation with the FBI.
According to Ford's statement to the Senate magistrate's board, he is quite certain that Kavanaugh repeatedly touched him while he was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
In part to Kavanaugh, he said in an impassioned statement that he is quite certain this did not happen.
According to Nielsen's data, approximately 20.4 million people saw the declaration on Friday.
The company estimated the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels that issued a declaration, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen typically has trouble counting people who watch television in offices.
To be an example, we can say that the number of spectators can be compared to a football final or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is widely accepted by the channel's presenters and averaged 5.69 million viewers while he was making the statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the declaration, people's interest remained.
Flake was the subject of Friday's drama.
After it was reported that the office of the moderate Republican Party would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS channel cameras recorded Kavanaugh on Friday surrounded by protesters as he attempted to take an elevator to declare at the Magistrate's rally.
It was seen live on the CNN channel with a lowered look as the protesters quarreled.
"Here I am, in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have an awful power, but so many women have nothing."
At that point and before the elevator doors closed, Flake said that his office had issued a notification and will provide further details during the meeting.
Cable and television networks were broadcasting the show live every hour, while the Chief Magistrate-at-large Kavanaugh was voting for the nomination to be Senator.
However, Flake said he would vote after the FBI had examined the arguments against the candidate for a week; remember that he was asking the minority Democrat to do so.
After talking to his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons, Flake had almost complete confidence in the investigation.
After talks with Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful because the Republican party does not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing with politics" on Brexit grounds
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her plans to leave the European Union, play with the future of the United Kingdom, and weaken the country's interests.
29 September 2018, Britain, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrive at the Conservative Party's speech in Birmingham.
In another interview that appeared on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, criticised the plan called a "damage game" for Brexit and noted that Britain and the European Union's payroll taxes were "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson for LSU player murder
Police have arrested a suspected person for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU University.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed for a secondary murder offense, Baton Rouge police department said.
Police have shared a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson and, according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS partner WAFB, police have recovered those glasses from the site of the murder and said Simpson's DNA was in them.
After interrogating Simpson, he confessed to having given Wayde a shot.
His attorney said his bail has been set at $350,000 USD.
The East Baton Rouge District Court office published a preliminary report on Friday, in which it is alleged that the cause of death is a gunshot from the head to the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police department for finding fugitives, the state police criminology lab, the Southern University police, and the surrounding citizens for assisting in the investigation to find the suspect.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva has thanked the police for the "protection and protection of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-foot player grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's division.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shattered" and "surprised" by Wayden's death.
"It's these things that always worry you," Wade said.
A volcano is burning ashes in Mexico City.
The ashes dumped by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached as far as the southern districts of the Mexican city.
The national center prior to the disasters warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended that they be removed from the volcano after a series of perceived activities in the crater; 183 gas and ash leaks were recorded for 24 hours.
Half of the volcano also had several tremors.
According to social media images, thin layers of ash can be seen in the car fan of some Mexican city neighborhoods (e.g., Xochimilcon).
Geophysicists have noted increased activity of the volcano about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
The battle between the police and Catalan separatists for independence before the fiftieth anniversary of the vote
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona this Saturday for their struggle with riot police while thousands of people joined the attending parties to remember the first anniversary of the Catalan elections to vote for independence.
He stopped a group of independents disguised as riot police, but eggs and paint powder were thrown at them, resulting in dust clouds in the streets full of tourists.
More fights were fought later because the police were using their tassels to stop the quarrel.
There were also several hours of independence groups singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in front of the Unionists who were singing "Long life to Spain".
According to local reporters, fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the clashes.
There is much unrest in this territory trying to find independence after the elections on 1 October, which were illegal according to the government of Madrid, but got a day to celebrate the independence of Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but citizen participation was very small because of the number of citizens who wanted to boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, 1000 were injured after the police attack, because they went to places where there were voting booths for elections to stop the voters, which led to violent clashes.
Independent groups have camped on Friday to avoid a national police demonstration.
There was a demonstration, but he was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician and went with his wife to the independence march, and said that Catalonia no longer has any hope of independence.
"We had a wonderful time last year.
My parents cried for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After a Pyrrhic but important victory in last December's local elections, Catalan parties for independence have had many problems this year in maintaining the interest of the public; some party leaders are exiled or arrested and are now awaiting trial for organising a referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is filming the demonstration for the police on her phone and states that politicians from both parties are to blame for this situation.
"There's more and more tension," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who is awaiting trial from last year in prison, declared that he would take part in the European Parliament elections scheduled for the following year.
"If I participate as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the restriction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Three men are arrested for hitting a house with a car.
33, 34, and 39-year-old men have been arrested for repeatedly hitting a Londonderry home with their car.
The event was held at Ballynagard Crescent at 19:30 local time (BST) on Tuesday evening.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building and its doors were damaged.
They also seem to have used a bullet in the car.
Menga kicks Livingston to 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal confirmed Livingston's tally
Livingston's promotion has impressed Rangers players and Steven Gerrard achieves his second defeat in 18 games as Ibrox club leader.
Dolly Menga's throw was crucial as Gary Holten's Hibernian team stepped up in the second half.
Gerrard's team is unbeaten this season in the Premiership and will have to play against Hearts leaders (who have eight extra points) next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will have to play Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team is unbeaten and has six games left this season; coach Holt doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses multiple opportunities in the face of strong visitors
Holten's team had to get ahead before he could score; he has tremendous integrity and caused several problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the door and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's headbutt.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew the visitors could annoy them at any time.
And with that mood came the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opener; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to mark the Menga, but the latter touched the ball in the middle of the gate.
At that stage of the game, possession was dominated by the Rangers, but home defense was invulnerable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without difficulty.
This pattern was followed up to the middle of the second half, but the launch of Alfredo Morelos required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman could not mark the goal for Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingston's other move.
Passes were repeatedly entered in the Livingston area and repeatedly taken out by the home players; two penalties were applied, for Halkett to challenge Representative Glenn Middleton and the other to touch the ball with his hand, but both were dismissed.
Livingston's "wonderful" game - analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston's match was exceptional and a perfect result.
They've made extraordinary moves for me and they've got tremendous opportunities to step up.
The style of the games and the team has hardly changed since they reached the top level, but Holt has been an exceptional coach: he has put the team on the right track since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been tremendous; he has organized and managed an exceptional defense and, Menga has been responsible for making Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers didn't have a lot of inspiration, though.
They work very well when ordered by the Warriors, but have forgotten the standards set by the coach.
The last move has been too weak and they have only beaten their home defences once; the Rangers must hurry if they want to get out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds counter welcome in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany; the visit was arranged to resolve relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed some of the issues, including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey's access to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to the colony to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turkish residents outside Turkey.
Due to security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people who wanted to meet in front of the mosque were blocked, but a number of supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters (most of them were Kurds) joined their voices to protest against Erdogan's policy measures and the German government's decision to welcome the president.
Protesters on both sides reflected the ongoing disagreements by the president; some Turks in Germany say that he is a hero and the others say that he is only an autocrat.
Deptford road crash: A cyclist is killed by a collision with a car.
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m.; that road in Deptford, southeast of town, is usually crowded with cars.
The driver stopped and the ambulance arrived immediately, but the man died right where he was.
On Childers Street, one mile from the accident on Saturday, another rider died a month ago and the driver fled.
The Metropolitan Police are working to identify the man and warn his family.
Some roads have been closed and the usual route of bus lines has been changed; it is also recommended to motorcyclists to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in a brawl
The six prison officers have been injured in a brawl at the men's high security prison, the prison's office said.
The dispute arose in Worcestershire's HMP Long Lartin Prison at 9:30 a.m. Sunday morning (BST) and the riot has not yet ended.
"Tornado" expert officers have arrived at the prison to end the confrontation that began with eight arrests; for now, it has been confined to a wing of the building.
Officers had minor injuries to their faces and healed them there.
A representative of the prison service has said: "We have sent the prison's expert staff to end the HMP Long Lartin riots.
We've cured six staff members of the injuries they've sustained.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who have begun the fight will be handed over to the police and will probably spend more time inside the prison."
HMP Long Lartin Prison has more than 500 arrests and, among them, the most violent criminals in the country.
In June the alcalde of the prison had to go to the hospital for the assault of an arrestee.
In addition, in October last year anti-bullying officers were required to go to prison to stop a serious brawl, because the detainees were attacking workers with billiard sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat with sudden flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (possibly the driest areas to benefit from)
It is rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but this is exactly what will happen next week as hurricane Rosa exhausts its strength; it will visit the southwest desert and risk sudden flooding.
The national weather service has already issued a warning on Monday and Friday about possible sudden flooding; the hurricane will enter Arizona's west side and go to Nevada's south and east sides. It will also pass through California and southern Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa will be heading straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains that will be on Monday will signal her arrival.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has written in a tweet: "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones originating 200 miles from Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border. "
According to the latest predictions of the hurricane's national center, 2-4 inches of water will be collected, and a maximum of 6 inches of water will be collected on the edge of Mogollon in Arizona.
With respect to other areas in the southwest of the desert (including the Midwest Rocky Mountains and the Great Rock), 1-2 inches of water will be collected; in isolated places a maximum of 4 inches will be collected.
As for those who expect sudden flooding, Rosa's rain may be a blessing because of the drought experienced by the land.
The floods should not be underestimated, but these rainfalls can be beneficial because of the drought that is afflicting the southwest.
According to the United States drought control service, 40 per cent of Arizona is experiencing severe droughts, which is the second highest category, the weather.com site stated.
First, the path of hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja Californa Peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa will remain strong on Sunday morning and produce maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour; it will then be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and will have a top speed of 12 miles/hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, and as a result, its power is weakening.
Those will arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
Since there may be severe storms in some parts of Mexico, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "rain showers will leave 3 to 6 inch of water southwest of Baja California to Sonora, and some places may pick up 10 inch."
After that, Rosa will pass through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's border during Tuesday morning hours as a tropical depression; then, she will cross Arizona and head south to Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threats to Rosa or her storms are severe storms that will occur in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the United States in the southwest desert," the national hurricane center said.
These rains will result in sudden floods of the gate and dangerous runoff in the deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for trying to kill someone
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 on Saturday morning (BST).
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area (Avon and Somerset), police have said.
If someone has a tape or traces of what happened to their phone, police officers have asked for their help.
Trump says Kavanaugh must stand up to the Democrats' "unreasonable rage".
"The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh refute the Democrats' ruthless and angry tactics," Trump said at his rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said that Kavanaugh must suffer the Democrats' "senselessness and rage" during his naming process.
On Tuesday Kavanaugh testified before Congress and completely denied the allyship of Christine Blasey Ford; according to the woman, she was raped decades ago by Kavanaugh when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing his allele.
The President said on Saturday, "The citizens of the United States saw the courage, intelligence and quality of Kavanaugh that day."
"The votes to elect Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal understanding of our time; this jurist has spent his entire life protecting public services," the president said to supporters in West Virginia.
Not only did he discuss Kavanaugh's nomination, but he also talked about the importance of the Republican party in these elections.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not going to participate, but I'm going to campaign," he said.
"That's why I'm here to fight on the side of the perfect candidates."
Trump also said that the Democratic party is using strategies to "climb and complicate" the campaign.
According to CNN, a top Republican party official, the procedural act of naming Kavanaugh will be held in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami; the number of dead is increasing.
According to authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of a series of earthquakes and tsunamis affecting the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia; most of them died while huge waves were destroying beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but in the evening the six-foot (18 foot) waves battered the coast; several people were dragged to death and everything on the road was destroyed.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami threat warning was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing various activities and did not flee immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the Indonesian disaster avoidance agency's (BNPB) representative in an interview given in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything in the land," Nugroho says; furthermore, the tsunami has traveled from the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before reaching the coast.
"A number of people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived," the representative said.
Approximately 16,700 people have attended the 24 centers in Palau.
With several buildings and shops destroyed, a mosque surrounded by shattered bridges and water can be seen in aerial photographs taken by the agency against disasters.
Replicas of the earthquake continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in a territory of 2.4 million people.
According to the report published by the Indonesian Agency for Validation and Application of Technology (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is in a long narrow bay, may have had something to do with the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
According to Nugroho, the disaster has been extremely "extreme"; thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Several bodies of victims have been found among the wreckage of destroyed buildings, resulting in an additional 540 injured and 29 people missing.
Nugroho also said that the number and disaster of the victims can be increased along the 300-mile (190 mile) coast of Palu; in particular, a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
The media in Donggala "doesn't work and we don't have any information," Nugroho stated.
According to Red Cross data, there are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area; at the moment, they are moving to places affected by the organization's staff and volunteers to offer assistance.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency received sharp criticism for failing to provide information about the tsunami that destroyed Palu, but according to the official reports, waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a recording shared on social networks, a man in a building can be seen, and he is shouting "tsunami coming" to warn the people on the street.
A few minutes later the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
Since the tsunami that was the earthquake has generated general electricity cuts, all the media in Palu has been suspended; therefore, it has been difficult for the competent authorities to organize rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has sent aid from Jakarta and other cities on cargo flights, but the evacuated people still need food and priority goods.
The city's airport has been reopened to facilitate relief efforts and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia tsunami leaves more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy.
Workers from the World Vision organization in Donggala have arrived in the city of Palu without difficulty (the workers there have built octopus shelters in the yard of the organization's office), but they have seen directly the terrible situation left by the disaster, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses ruined," he said.
That's really bad.
Although relief teams engaged in sad work-arounds in disaster cases, some complained about the fact that experienced personnel and assistants advised Palura not to attend.
Following Indonesian legislation, international financing, supply and personnel supply can only begin after the zone is classified as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster," says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"The Government, having said 'OK, it's a national disaster', may be able to open the doors to international aid, but it has not yet been classified as such."
On the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palun, the friends and families of those who were still missing had not yet lost hope of a miracle of small probability appearing to their loved ones.
On Saturday, a small child was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers took out a woman who had been stuck under the wreckage for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team trained two of the paralympians who had been part of the missing Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi Jn., were students.
"As an expert on the paraplegic world, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Gendon Jn. explained that in the paraglider community the next few hours after the announcement about the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel, he had been sending WhatsApp messages to his competitors, who were at the beach party.
His messages, however, only got one gray arrow, no two blue marks.
"I think that means those messages were not sent," he added.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they were filling up the automatic safes at Newport on the Leveen
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee who was filling out an automatic cashier at Newport on the Brink, according to news reports from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying the automatic cashier into the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the announcement.
While working, another man "attacked the Brink employee from behind" and stole a bag of money he was about to hand over.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to what was stated in the announcement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the surprise.
If you have any information about their identity, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper has changed his name, it's Ye now
The rapper Kanye West has changed his name - Ye is now.
On Saturday he announced the change on Twitter: "The creature was known as Kanye West."
West, aged 41, has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time, and used the pseudonym as a title to his eighth album, which he published in June.
He made the change before appearing on Saturday Night Live, because no one was expected to present his latest album Yandhi.
He took Ariana Grande's place on the show because, in the words of the show's creator, he was unable to participate due to "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West has stated that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the (English) Bible and 'you' means 'you' in the Bible," West recently stated, talking to Big Boy, the radio host, about the album.
"So I'm you, I'm us, we're us.
It comes from Kanye, who only means one, to become Ye -- making it a reflection of our good, bad, confusion and everything.
This work better reflects who we are."
He is one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but stated that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love this year.
JAY-Z, who formerly collaborated with West, has also changed the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico AMLO promises not to use army against citizens
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged not to use armed force or army against citizens when the country will live the 50th anniversary of a repression that spilled blood against students.
Lopez Obrador, who vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he will never "use the army to repatriate Mexican citizens."
On October 2, 1968, the army fired on a peaceful scene in the square, and 300 people were killed, to interrupt the uprising of leftist students who were gaining strength throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn, with monthly subsidies and open up more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people to criminal groups.
U.S. should double AA funding
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it uses to research in that area, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments arose when several U.S. government parties made a number of notifications about AI, although the U.S. in general does not have an official AA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double-checking AA research would be a good start, because other countries are far from the US and are looking for the next discovery in AA," Lee said.
Duplicating funding can double the chances of making big AA discoveries in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is General Manager of Sinovation Ventures, which he has researched at one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the American high-end Othello player and later served as an executive at Microsoft Research and was Google's president in the Chinese field.
Lee praised the previous technology competitions of the US government, including the Defense Projects Advanced Research Agency Robotic Competition, and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next dreamers.
U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get government funding, says Lee.
"It doesn't mean that China leads academic leaders, it's companies," Lee added.
Facebook, Google, and many other technology companies have taken the smartest of the universities to act in AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policies would also help the U.S. to encourage AA activities.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to AA doctors," he stated.
The China State Council issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The China Nation's Natural Science Foundation finances the people of academic institutions the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is less, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense created an Artificial Intelligence Center where industry and educational partners gathered, and the White House announced it had formed the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI NEXT.
As for NSF, it invests more than $100 million a day in AI research.
Meanwhile, EU legislation aiming to form a National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in the last few months.
Macedonians held referendum to decide whether or not to change country's name
The country of Macedonia voted by referendum on Sunday not to change its name to "the ancient republic of Macedonia".This change would end the conflict of several decades, the possibility of membership of the European Union and NATO since it was blocked by Greece.
Greece, which formerly had a province called Macedonia, still claims that the name of its northern neighbors includes its territory, and blocks its access to NATO and the EU.
The governments of both countries reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say that this change is to the detriment of the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not vote in the referendum and his boycott of the campaign caused doubts about whether 50 per cent will have to be achieved in the referendum to be valid.
This is the question that could be read on the referendum paper: "Are you in favour of NATO and the EU being members with Greek consent?"
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is worth getting the chance to join EU and NATO institutions for Macedonia, being one of the countries created when Yugoslavia was dissolved.
"I come to vote about the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, because under the umbrella of the European Union, in order to live freely, that will make us a safer life," stated Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have stated that they will follow the outcome of the vote to be decisive.
Three-thirds of parliament will be required to change its name.
The state selection committee stated that no surprises were reported until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, only 16 per cent have voted, compared to 34 per cent in the last election for parliament in 2016, in which 66 per cent of those who had the right to vote voted.
"I went to vote for my children, it's our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a Skopje voter from the capital.
Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in favour of having their country's name changed in the Macedonian referendum to NATO and the possibility of joining the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing for a small stage and stairs in front of the shops that wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to meet our conditions and not get through the doors of servers," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia unification."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership could bring so much needed investment to Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 per cent.
"I think most of it will be in favor because more than 80 per cent of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev stated after the vote.
In his words, saying "yes" would confirm our future.
According to the poll published by the Organization for Political Research of Macedonia last Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the vote - less than necessary.
Another poll, by Macedonian Telma TV, said that 57 per cent of residents thought about voting on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent stated that they would kick him out.
For a referendum to be successful, 50 percent plus one vote must be cast in favor.
If there was a mistake in the referendum, it would be the first serious mistake in the policy towards the West since it began in May of last year.
See: Manchester City team player Sergio Aguero overcomes all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's entire defence in Manchester City's 2-0 Saturday victory over Etihad Stadium on the football field in Manchester, England.
Aguero easily scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper picked up a pass in midfield at the start of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed a defender after escaping several others at the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he walked to the left, and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguero on the first touch inside the area, who used his right foot with the shot directed to the right of the net to overcome Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is going through so many problems at the foot," stated City's coach, Pep Guardiola.
"We said he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
And it was.
We were very glad that he scored in that moment."
But Sterling gave the Blueshirts their starting advantage in the Premier League competition.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero picked up the ball in Brighton area on the play.
He gave a great pass to Leroy Sane on the left side.
San made a few touches to the far post before running Sterling.
The blue jersey pushed the ball into the net before it went off the line.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 noon at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena football field in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end for the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the competition, there wasn't much reason to force it to a different start.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, wants to take advantage of Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but the Rockies still experience the effects of equality, which still holds the Los Angeles Dodgers' one-game advantage in the NL West tournament.
The Rockies have managed to get a wildcard to win at least 5-2 to the Nationals on Friday night, but will still have to try to win their first first first-class title.
"Even if we play for nothing, at least we know that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded, and that the opposing team will play at the best level in all areas we will have to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete on that?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a trigger, but it looks like they'll let Scherzer throw it under those circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a launch attempt on Thursday and it seems likely that he would be acting as a hurler on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and scored 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this year.
Trump's statement in West Virginia
The president looked over the situation and spoke about the situation of Brett Kavanaugh, chosen by himself in the Supreme Court, when he was talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We have five weeks of the most important elections of our lives.
It's one of the big ones -- I'm not a candidate but, in fact, I am, that's why I'm everywhere to compete for big candidates," he declared.
Trump added, "You can see the overwhelming group of Democrats extreme, right now you can see what's happening.
And they do not hesitate to use whatever means are necessary to deprive them of their power, see avarice, see ignobleness.
They don't care who you hurt, who you get over them for control and power, because we're not going to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, aim to "rise and hinder."
He said that "you've seen it for the last four days." He added that Democrats "are angry and cautious and are disgusting and false."
He signed on to Democratic Party Senator Dianne Feinstein, of the Senate District Court Committee, who received shouts from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what.
No, ah, no, I'm waiting for someone - that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour people will not continue to have a great reach.
They are intolerant of what they think.
When activists from my local party Momentum voted against me, it was not a big surprise.
In fact, I'm the last one on the list of those who didn't welcome us from the Labour MPs - all for saying what we thought.
Joan Ryan, a member of Parliament, also received similar treatment because she spoke out in favor of antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, in Europe, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on similar issues.
News about the East Nottingham meeting on Friday said "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been that.
Unfortunately, the word for "friendly, respectful" policy has not been remembered today, if ever there was one.
It is becoming apparent that there are different views in the Labour party and opinions are judged on whether they are acceptable to the party's leaders.
This began when Jeremy became the leader, when members of the same political parties had previously turned 180 degrees and started demanding that I accept the views that I would never accept - both as regards national security and the single EU market.
Every time I spoke in public - no matter what I said - on social networks a bunch of opinions that accuse me of middle politics and require me to be removed from it, harassment takes place, on the part of those who say I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the opinions thrown against me are political.
Every day I depend on friends who have to deal with the pursuits of sexism or race with professionalism and honesty, but never with shame.
One of the unpleasant aspects of politics in this period is that the current level of persecution appears to be normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week stated that the Labour party should promote a culture of tolerance.
We don't really get a single opinion at every motion of "unconference" or when party rules become tighter.
Over the past two years I've received so many warnings to keep my head down that I wouldn't talk so much and thus say, "I'd be fine."
But I'm not into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I resigned my room under the indifference of the Thatcher government and joined the public services that most needed me - as a local councillor or a minister of the government.
I never hid my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will have any doubt about my political views and my disagreements with current leaders.
I would tell those who encouraged Friday's move when the country is turning to Brexit that will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, that I don't understand how to waste time and energy in discussing my loyalty to the leaders of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour party or not: I am very proud to work for you and I promise to continue working for what is best for your interests, I will not be moved away with threats or political files.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is still in the lead who hasn't lost a game
The final two surprise tries somehow changed the final result, but without a doubt, Ayr deserved the win in the match of the day of the wonderful and fun Tennent Championship.
They are in first place on the board, and are the only ones to have lost none of their ten matches.
By the end of the day, they had a better defense, and they took better advantage of their chances, and the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be happy.
"So far we have been put to the test, and we have lost none, so we must be content," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose added, "My honors to Ayr, the chances that they made better use of it than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, played by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but the yellow card taken from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melros to add points and Jason Baggot failed to perform the try.
Climo interfered with the Ayr lead by penalty, before, at the end of the first part, he had a solitary rehearsal and Ayr went 17-5 to the break.
But Melrose started off great in the second half and Patrick Anderson's try, carried out by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
There has subsequently been a long break due to the serious injury of player Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out on his handstand and on his return to the game Ayr went further when Stafford McDowall's try was converted by Climo.
Then the captain of Blair Macpherson Ayr was given a yellow card and again Melrose benefited from being more of a man, with Bruce Colvine's try that didn't take place, living to the end.
The homers came back and, when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to check that he had no Climo ball, off the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the forward Ayr's team's maul.
Climo did a lot, almost as he did from the start, when Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and knocked out Gregor Henry's wing in the fifth rehearsal of the homers.
The star of the Still Game series will embark on a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the actor Ford Kieran wants to jump into the world of hospitality, as he has been known to have been appointed director of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actress plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, of which he is a writer and one of the stars along with long-time member Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the show will be the next season's last, the ninth, and Kieran appears to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor has refused to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun magazine's sources said that he wanted to incorporate Kiernan into a "mark of important restaurants" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Inside Bolivia hopes court re-opens road to Pacific
Seamen patrol the ship's apparatus covering headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
At the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon you can read the following: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to restore it."
Across the interior Bolivia, 19th-century Chilean coastal conflicts of great blood flow still survive - as they continue to yearn to sail the Pacific.
These expectations are perhaps stronger now than in recent decades, because Bolivia expects to resolve international courts after five years of deliberation on October 1.
"Bolivia is experiencing a moment of solidarity and a sense of calm, and of course she is optimistic about the outcome," says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the international court's decision through huge screens distributed across the country, in the hopes that the Hague Court will give reason to Bolivia's demands - after decades of negotiation - as Chile has been forced to negotiate on Bolivia's sovereign seaway.
Evo Morales, the charming Bolivian native president - who is heavily involved in the conflict to be re-elected next year - has also made a number of contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said last August.
On the other hand, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia and, as a result, not much will change.
The United Nations organization located in the Netherlands has no power to grant the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the results of the negotiations that may be held.
The resolution of the International Court of Justice six months after the negotiations were concluded states that the case was "not difficult," said Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than promote Bolivia's cause, they have gone backwards in the last four years.
"The subject of the arrival at sea has been taken captive by the present Bolivian administration," Zarat said.
President Morales' belligerent rhetoric has ruined all the desire to do well what remained in Chile, he says.
Bolivia and Chile have yet to tackle several issues, but it will be very difficult to continue discussing them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who say that the court's resolution is particularly swift.
On Monday Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to restore relations with Chile" and "end the 139 years of disagreement, for the good of both."
Calzadilla stated that he does not agree with what Morales - still one of South America's popular presidents - says he uses the problem of the sea to gain political support.
"Bolivia will never renounce the right to have a way to reach the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity we should have seen to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it can believe in the U.S.
North Korean minister, Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be disarmed until they can believe in Washington.
Rik stated this before the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States at the summit in Singapore, in front of enemy leaders, to keep its promise.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Singapore expressed concern at the fact that Kim Jong Un of North Korea is on the verge of re-blocking nuclear diplomacy for more than three months.
Ri says it is "utopia" to think that the continued sanctions and the US's objections to the end of the Korean War will put North Korea at his feet.
Washington does not want to agree to the confession before Pyongyang makes moves to reject the weapons.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is very much skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is in earnest as the only way to ensure the country's apparent security, about the rejection of all weapons.
Pompeo plans to move to Pyongyang next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion show on your next High Street road showcases the newest line of massive hats
If you want to increase your collection of hats or block the sun completely, here is the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a range of oversized jewelled hats in their spring-udale collection in 2019, which left the style displayed at the Paris Fashion Week quivering.
This summer, non-traditional hats have arrived on Instagram and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the pass.
Valentino's most prominent pieces, with a beix-coloured hat feather-like wing, covered the heads of the models.
Among the other large-sized accessories we have are a sort of jewel-filled anguarque, a rather rare hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designs for head heating.
Thom Brown also exhibited a collection of vintage masks - in time for Halloween.
Many masks full of color have lips sewn up and look more like Hannibal Lecter than those of high tailoring.
One looked like a diving mask with goggles and pipes, while another looked like an ice cream cuckoo.
If you are a fan of fashion, you have good news.
Style experts say that the deaf will go out on the street, even to those around you.
Big sized hats come after ‘La Bomba', a two-foot wide winged straw hat that we've seen a lot of famous people wear from Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the hat, which is not at all practical, which has been successful on social networks, has led to the passage of another object - the straw bag on the beach, almost as large as the bathing suit model that wears it.
The raffia orange bag, cut with raffia fringe and white leather handle, has been finished by Jacquemus' La Riviera 2019 spring-uda collection protagonist during the Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage of Celebrities said in FEMAIL, "I hope that big hats and big bags for the beach reach the main streets next summer, with the great echo that the designer has had it would be hard to ignore the demand for giant supplements."
John Edward: Basic language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland make academic excellence records and continue in 2018, apart from exam results, which have been solidified with both individual and team excellent results in sports, art, music and other community projects.
With 30,000 students across Scotland represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the Scottish Council of Independent Schools strives to provide the best service between the students and their parents.
The purpose of independent schools is to prepare students for higher education, the careers chosen by them, and as citizens.
Since we can design and implement a personalized school curriculum as an education sector, we have seen that modern languages continue to be the common choice chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will come to his mind.
If you talk to him in his language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful way of reminding us that we don't have to use English alone to build relationships with people from other countries and gain confidence in them.
From the results of this year's final exams, we can see that there are languages at the top of the most passed in independent schools.
68 per cent of students who study foreign languages have achieved the best A classification.
The data, collected in SCIS' 74 student school, show that 72 per cent of students achieved the best A classification in Chinese Mandarin; 72 per cent in German; 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an indispensable ability that will no doubt be needed by young people and children in the future.
Languages are now cultivated as a teaching axis (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula as well as others.
In 2014, a survey of the EU Commission found that one of the main reasons for filling the job was language ignorance.
More and more, knowledge of languages is becoming indispensable to prepare young people for future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are indispensable in a globalized world.
Whatever career they have chosen, if they have learned their second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong advantage.
Being able to speak directly to people from foreign countries will automatically put the multilingual person at the head of the competition.
According to YouGov's survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language in such a way as to have a common conversation, and it rose to a two-digit figure among those who spoke only French, 15 per cent.
That's why it's so important to invest in language teaching for children today.
Speaking more than one language, mostly used in economic developments, will give your children more opportunities to find better employment.
In Scotland, schools differ according to the language they teach.
One number of students prefer more classical modern languages, and the other look to 2020 what appear to be important to the EU, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of language opportunities for independent schooling, with teachers with expertise in the field.
The purpose of independent schools in Scotland is to prepare children for success in different tasks in the future and provide them with tools to do so.
This time we cannot deny that, in an international business environment, where languages are indispensable to the future of the country, this is a need to reflect on education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "international communication abilities."
Independent schools will continue to offer their opportunities, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Monday in San Diego.
LeBron James is about to end the wait for fans to debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has stated that James will play in Monday's pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he has not yet determined how many minutes he will play.
"More than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell stated on Twitter that James will act for a limited time.
After this week's training, James was asked about programming for the Lakers six games prior to the season.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare for this stage of my career," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin his rally campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be the first of Trump's five rally tours for the next week, and will visit several places he has friends, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a vote that would confirm him to fill the Supreme Court square, Trump wants to gain support or support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November election.
What time is the West Virginia Trumpe meeting today and how can it be viewed on the Internet?
Trump's tour in West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. today, Saturday September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's mic in West Virginia on YouTube via streaming.
It looks like Trump will conduct this week's Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh hearings until you have confirmation from the Senate that you are under inappropriate sexual behavior while the FBI investigation continues.
But the main objective of this round of mitigations is to help Republicans win some votes in the November election.
President Trump's campaign therefore states that the purpose of these five next week's mitigations is to "revitalize the voters and to help them retain their majority in the Senate of the Republicans and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Congress's congressional record is of paramount importance and the President will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign session," Trump's campaign spokesman said, which did not allow the Reuters agency to register.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, it will allow today's myth to cover Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia in the past month, a state that won by 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is running for office.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to go there to support his election," says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team will try to remain in the individual competition on Sunday
After three one-sided tries, it was said that the Saturday afternoon four had what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is the concept of sport invented from top to bottom in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So where can you say the time is now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they have four, so I think it's time, in a way," Jordan Spieth said, as he made a one-day field.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, by four points, of the twelve in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not going for them, and they need help, mostly from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been absolutely decisive, from draw to green, and he is running with the example.
Those screaming to celebrate have gotten louder as the round progresses, and he has pulled the important putt, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated with another shout like a fart won in game 15, which indicates that the American team is not out of the competition.
"You have to look for strength and care only about your game," Spieth said.
That's what's left of those players.
18 holes to make a difference.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, historic players of the Ryder Cup tournament.
The special but charming couples of Europe are four out of four whether they have failed to take an oath.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't throw a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, they also avoided bogeys on Friday afternoon and the last nine on Friday.
This shift and the energy that came to them from the booming crowd made him a couple to be overcome on Sunday and there was no more famous European player than Fleetwood and Molina to close Europe's victory when the sun rises at Le Golf National.
It's better to have both in different holes together.
However, it is too early to talk about big Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson accelerated Sergio García's work, the best of four, when he was equal with Alex Nore.
A bogey and two doubles have been placed ahead to defeat the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole that was never too close.
However, on Sunday, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The foursome was fascinated to see closely the couples' interaction, the advice they gave, the ones they didn't give, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team, and had a remarkable advantage in the final, but the four-man session showed that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, though some, Stateside in particular, doubted it.
Europe get 10-6 advantage in Ryder Cup final
Europe has taken a significant advantage in the final of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's quartet went 10-6 against the United States of America.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari scored two tries against Tiger Woods, and the four valuable points so far were awarded at the Le Golf National.
Europe's Thomas Bjorn, looking to regain the lost prize from Hazelin two years ago, was dominant in the morning and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance, and they won two games, but could not overcome the side.
It took eight points from Jim Furyk to hold the prize in 12 individual games on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to have won four consecutive points and together with Molinari, who are called "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are second in Ryder Cup championship history by winning four points in four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed at Fourball, he completed the game brilliantly with a 5 and 4 light run over the tired Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturday in some way, showed touchdowns of excellence, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and four-ball matches, seven in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning fourballs and returned with Henrik Stenson in the fours to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best in the world and third.
Europe did not find its way into the pleasant, fresh day of southwest Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomasee set the reference for the Americans, scoring two points, on Saturday.
They won a staggering 2-1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and then also over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 fours after losing two early holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup championship has a team surpassed the four-point difference and entered the singles, although Furyk's side only needed a draw to retain the prize.
After the second best in two days, after the more confrontation on Sunday, they will precede him.
North Korea has given a round of no-confidence in giving up its weapons.
North Korea's foreign minister informed the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continued to impede confidence in the United States and in such a situation will by no means cease to make nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho stated to the annual plenary meeting of the world organization that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as interrupting nuclear weapons and missile tests, leaving room for nuclear tests, and promising to stop developing technology and nuclear weapons.
"However, we don't see a satisfactory response from the US," he said.
"Without the U.S.'s confidence, there is no trust in our national security and under no circumstances can we leave the first weapons behind."
Ri repeats the family complaints about the resistance in Washington within a process of "phases" for denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for gradually taking steps.His statements appear to be significant in the fact that he did not reject the unilateral denuclearization of Pyongyang in the past.
Rik Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, referred to the first summit in Singapore on June 12, Kim then pledged to "denuclearize the Korean Peninsula", and Trump vowed to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a way to formally end the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States of America has stated that Pyongyang must lay down its first weapons.
Washington has ignored international voices calling for the relief of sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. again says it will have to lay down its first weapons and continues to increase the level of pressure on sanctions, in order to force them to achieve their goal," Ri said, "It is against the expression at the end of the war."
"It is a utopia for those who do not know how to think that they will put us at their feet.
The problem is that continued punishments are increasing depravity."
Rik has not mentioned the second summit between Kim et Trump announced by the U.S. leadership at the United Nations early this week.
The minister, on the other hand, has mentioned three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and has added that "if the other party were South Korea instead of the United States, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked."
However, the tone of Ri's speech would be quite different from that of last year, where he stated that at the NB plenary meeting, North Korea was inevitably looking at missiles to the U.S., since Trump "was called Mr. missile" by "Mr. Devil President" Kim during the suicide mission.
Earlier this year, in the presence of the United Nations, Trump, who declared that he would "minorize" North Korea, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps to reject the weapons, but stated that it still had to be done and that they would continue with sanctions until North Korea was denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump stated that he did not have the time to do so, "even if it's two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, stated before the NB Security Council on Thursday, "We must continue to strengthen the sanctions of the Security Council without failing until we can verify that its denuclearization is genuine."
The Security Council has unanimously encouraged sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to block funding of nuclear and ballistic programs in Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with Ri outside of the NBEN plenary meeting and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but the final trip did not work out.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July saying that something had been accomplished for North Korea alone, after hours of reporting that this was "ghansters making demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon that they would leave the missile sites and a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures for them."
He told Kim that the "equivalent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump had agreed to in Singapore and had been directing him towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken a course of sufficient rest.
This year's Harvard University year will give undergraduates more sleep to try to cope with the increasingly widespread culture of those who learn by drinking coffee for the night.
One teacher saw that at the best university in the world, students lose their rewards as a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the course, which he believes is the first such in the UK.
He began the course when he gave a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning time.
"A girl came up to me at the end and said, 'Why should I do this now, during my last year of school?'
He said that no one told him how important it is to sleep well, which surprised me," the Telegraph said.
In the course, offered for the first time this year, students are shown the effect of proper sleeping habits on their studies and sports results, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of health services at the university, stated that the university decided to start the course when students found that he slept little during the week.
The hour-long course takes a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom where students press coffee pots, curtains, coaches, and books to see the effect of caffeine and light, and to see the effect of sleeping too little on sports performance and to realize the importance of their sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are explained that too little sleep can lead to heart attack, and may increase their risk of depression or cancer.
On a campus map, using interactive icons, participants are invited to reflect on their daily habits.
"We know that we will not suddenly change the habits of the students.
But we think they have a right to know, if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as your right to know the effects that that will have on your health," added Czeisler.
There is still a culture of pride for "gauging," he says, and the increasing pressure on modern technologies and students increases the problem of o little.
Sleep well, with good quality sleep, should be the "secret weapon" for dealing with stress, fatigue, and nervousness - even to gain weight because sleep makes the brain hungry and we will always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, has helped Professor Czeisler design the course, and had one of his first classes in his first year at Harvard.
She stated that the course opened her eyes and encouraged her to take part in a course that complemented the campus.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask the graduates to do a peer-to-peer study before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set the alarm to determine when to go to bed, and also to rouse them, and to know the effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms, and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga overcome Gerrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another defeat by Dolly Menga's striker Steven Gerrard's in a 1-0 set at Livingston.
They wanted to first win after a 4-1 win over Ibrox at St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holte's team caused Gerrard's team's second defeat in his 18th game as coach, allowing his eight points to escape out of control by the Hearts of the Landbrokes championship leaders.
Menga had gin seven minutes before the strike break, and Rangers' work did not achieve the draw.
The Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, while Livingston have climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
The problem may have been more serious for the Rangers as Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury due to being hit by an object that had been thrown at him from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes and managed to reach the semifinals of the Ayr Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was accompanied by Livi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and would be delighted to see her well-adjusted outfit smothering her opponents at every turn.
Rangers dominated the possession, but Livingston benefited more from their moves.
Scott Pittman from Menga winger Allan McGregor should have scored the winning goal, but the midfielder failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to pull away from the back post.
Rangers took control, but in the last third their hope seemed to be greater than their belief in the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt that there must be a penalty within the quarter limit when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers only managed to score two outs in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's headbutt and Ovie Ejaria's light snap.
The first goal scored by Livi in the 34th minute may have hurt the game's progress, but no one can deny that they deserved it at least considering the great effort made.
Once again, the Rangers failed to get a stop on the Jacobs' ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly picked up Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard took over on the break with Coulibaly switching to Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect as the winger passed it to Morelos, but Extreme Kelly ran out of his line to block it.
But Livingston continued to force the outsiders to play their favorite game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their advantage, but McGregor held on steadfastly before making a headbutt from coroner Lithgow.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Middleton, again called for a penalty at the end as he got stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA PRERA ... future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity: after that invention came what is called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a milestone in science, and it has also become a landmark of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", featuring the unrevealed scientist Roy Rogers and the cowboy Dale Evans in the lead role:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "Geiger is a counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, you can hear it right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, with a few days left to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' the malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill bad cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells within the treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and then alleviating them in the laboratory.
They can then see a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject it.
The vaccine in the test is giving very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells managed to disappear from her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This is what the method consists of extracting immune cells from the patient and then transforming them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Cancer Research in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a promising vaccine."
HER2 "proves the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colon and onset cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involved in taking immune cells from patients and how the cell reaches carcinogens during "training" has worked when treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West entered a diatribe in support of Trump wearing a MAG cap after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shouted at a Saturday Night Live in the studio when he praised United States President Donald Trump and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, began to speak out against the Democrats and confirmed Trump's favored attitude.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they tell me, 'How do you like Trump, because he's a racist?'"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America by now," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon as the lead character.In that sketch, Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh joked about his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual assault.
Though not broadcast, West's offensive speech was promoted to social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock West was trying to make fun of it with publishing.
In addition, West complained in front of the public that he had passed badly between the wings on account of his hat.
"I was attacked between the wings.
I said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They attacked me!
And then they say I'm in a bottom-up place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom of the place?" saying, "I'm going to wear my superman's cape, because that means you can't tell me what I'm going to do.
Try the love."
As a result of his words at least a couple of times whistles came from the public and the members of the SNL session seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, and one person present told the magazine, "The whole studio was completely silent."
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend had died a few days earlier, rapper Rac Miller.
The Web surprised many with its interpretation of the song I love, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who published the tweet, "Thanks to one of the bravest spirits: YOU'RE AMAZING MAFIARI".
But as the talk show's host Karen Hunter tweeted, West was simply "being what he is and that's great."
"But I do NOT want to reward a person who makes an ideology harmful to the community (by buying its music or clothing or protecting its 'art').
He's free.
And we are too," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "a creature called Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also been named Snoop Lion, and how not to mention the legend of the same music Prince changed his name to a symbol and made him the artist Prince he had been before.

The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has been up against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the role of Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series Game of Thrones HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has been opposed to the stereotype of masquerading heroes, stating that due to the appearance of such roles on screen, young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
In statements to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought that ‘something has been done wrong' and asked how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem during #MeToo.
Kit was also recently married to Rose Leslie, who is a star of Game of Thrones and is also 31 years old, and admitted that he "believes" the issue needs to be addressed.
"Personally, and with great certainty, I think about this moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they grow up, considering the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also be responsible for the promotion of toxic masculinity due to the fact that they are highly masculine characters.
He continued, ‘What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and in the streets, that makes young boys feel that they have to do this way of being a man?
I think that's one of the important issues of our time, how can we change that?
It's remarkable that something went wrong for the young men."
He also admitted in the interview that he will not make any predecessors or successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he has "finished it with battlefields and horses."
From November onwards he will appear on Kit Sam Shepard's Return to the True West, the story of a film producer and his brother; his brother is a thief.
The actor recently reported that he thought meeting his wife Rose was the best thing Game of Thrones has given him.
"I met my wife on this show, and so she gave me my future family and my future life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the woman that Kit's character Jon Snow loves, in the fantasy series that won her an Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 at a family estate in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% rise in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of citizens with HIV and HIV.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Over 40,000 new cases have been recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are transmitted by sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spreading due to blood transfusions infected in some areas of China.
But in this way the number of people infected with HIV was reduced to nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBTI people is widespread.
As a result of conservative values in the country, it has been estimated in research that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry a woman.
Many transmissions of diseases are due to the use of inappropriate sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has ordered universal access to HIV medication within its efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied the GOP senators data leaked by the employee, and has turned the issue upside down in "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. ord. Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on legislators' Wikipedia pages.
Democrats in Los Angeles have stated that the assertions were prompted by "ultra-right wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies and more contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information contained information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Senate Committee Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came just after the three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
It was reported by conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState that the IP address identifying the source was linked to Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' working group, Hill stated.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and completely untrue," Waters continued.
"My team member - who has been exposed to identity, personal information and security as a result of these false allegations of fraud - has no responsibility in relation to the leaking of this information.
The unfounded allegation is completely false and completely untrue."
Waters' statement was immediately met with criticism online, for example by Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
"This denial is made from anger," Fleischer wrote.
"That shows he doesn't have the character of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not appear angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
He must appear calm and tenuous.'
Fleischer seemed to want to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, also a Republican candidate who wants to remove Waters in the central elections of the legislature, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"If the significance is true," he tweeted.
In his statements, Waters said that his office had warned "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities as far as these fraudulent statements were concerned.
"We guarantee that those who have broken the law will be known," he continued, "and that they will have to respond before the law with respect to any action which is harmful and dangerous to any and all members of my crew."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - a parody of low-powered spy Rowan Atkinson
Now it has become traditional to look for the meanings of Brexit in any new film with some sort of British ray, and that seems not to be applicable in the franchise of Johnny English's action comedy parody.It started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Are we going to get a new export option for our nation by satirizing what kind of garbage we are?
In any case, Johnny English, who has big, goofy eyes and a rubbery face, has renewed his license to fuck things up for a second time: his name shows above everything that he is nothing more than a vast comic creation designed for lands that see non-English cinema.
Despite Glamour's particular desire to get flatter, Clouseu is of course a silly secret agent who somewhat resembles Clouseu, even a ray of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the boy who helps the Chariots of Fire with a single note during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In Barclaycard's television commercials, which we have already forgotten, Atkinson interpreted is also naturally based on the mysterious traveller and international man, leaving chaos behind.
There's one or two major moments in this JE's latest tour.
I loved how Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the crossbows of the rollercoaster hitting him in the helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is seen on the screen, but the humor lacks power and is too superfluous, especially when "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy among their ingredients.
The humor seems more like directed at kids than it is aimed at adults, and for me the absurd adventures to Johnny English aren't as clever and clever as the jokes of Atkinson's silent film character Bean.
The constant topical premise now is that Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has been infiltrated into Britain's secret spy web, revealing the identities of all the British agents at work, and is upset by the agent on duty. Unfortunately the small role is played by Kevin Eldon.
That's too much for a Prime Minister with a pompous, harassed character, who is already losing his political reputation altogether: Emma Thompson delivers the best with a character almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help too much.
His intelligence advisor informs him that precisely since all the active spies have been compromised he will need to recover someone who is in retirement.
And that means Johnny English is walking around as well as he can, now he's a teacher in an elegant place, but he's giving confidential lessons about acting as a secret operator: a few nice jokes there, because English offers a spy academy of the kind of ‘School of Rock'.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting, and is reunited with Bough, who had previously been his partner.
Bough is now a married man attached to a U-boat commandant, Vicki Pepperdine is lost in that role in the style of a young millionaire.
So, in Your Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin are back in action to make things miserable, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is fascinated by the tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the informal woes of Britain, Jason Volta is malicious, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their farce adventures: disguised as servants, they set fire to a French restaurant. They create chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes complete anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality helmets to go and see what Volta's house is like from the inside.
All stops are made to look at this final sequence, but even though it's nice and noisy, it's all from children's television.
So-so.
And just as it has happened to me with other Johnny English films, this comes to mind: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that his talent deserves?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are preparing a plan to work on a four-day week but collect five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that predicts British workers to work one week a day but collect five days a week.
The party seems to want employers to give workers what they have saved through the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them one more holiday.
Workers would have a three-day weekend, but still take home the same pay.
Sources have stated that the idea ‘comes well' on the party's economic agenda and that it wants to turn the country to the workers.
The passing of four working weeks has been supported by the union Congress as a way of making a profit from the changing economy by the workers.
A high ranking in the Labour Party has stated to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is anticipated before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen from day to day, but the week of four workdays coincides with the party's vision of revitalizing the working economy and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the party supporting such an idea, as the Greens had defended the four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
Nonetheless, the aspiration has not yet received the support of the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson has stated: "The four-day working week is not party policy, and the party does not appreciate it."
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's congress last week to determine his view on a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said, no doubt, that ‘faceless directors' and ‘spectators' should be deprived of their power in companies that provided public services.
On the shadow minister's planet, too, the current shareholders of the water company may not receive their full share, because a Labour government may make removals if it finds that there has been a misconduct.
In addition, he confirmed that there were plans to include workers in the enterprise directors and create Inclusive Property Funds, to give 10% of private sector companies capital to workers, who could collect annual dividends of between £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation might or may not have changed their minds.
As for the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI investigation has delayed his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and it has put the question on the table whether or not the conclusions of the investigation could lead to the removal of his support by any republican senator.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, who is a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could make anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his partymate in South Carolina.
"I think, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the plea has been made known, I said, "You did that?"
He answered with emotion, clearly, without a doubt."
Graham's vow, however, seems to be written on stone.
"I am determined as far as Brett Kavanaugh is concerned and he would also face prosecution for causing an explosion," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it with all the firmness," added Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he talks about couldn't verify that.
He's 36.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen's Festival will take place in New York, an annual musical event that brings in tremendous artists and has a mission: eradicate world poverty.
With the seventeenth edition this time, the Global Citizen's Festival will bring thousands of people to the Grand Course in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the event's true purpose, that is to eradicate extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free entry for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those wishing to attend the concert must perform various tasks or "actions" such as sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or making an otherwise valid call to help increase awareness of the goal of erasing poverty.
But what success has Global Citizen achieved when they have 12 years left to accomplish their goal?
Is it an original idea to encourage people to ask them to do an action through a free concert, or is it just another case of what they call "clicktivism", which is to make them feel like they are making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet to people?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have logged more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, putting pressure on it to meet various goals.
It says that the world leaders have urged these actions to announce policies and commitments of more than $37 billion, and these policies and commitments will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people before the year 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and predictions derived from the actions, 10 of which have already been paid or received at least $1 billion.
The group estimates that the secured funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, an association of investors and implementers committed to "helping children develop their full potential", headquartered in the United Kingdom." He promised to give Rwanda $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of yours Global Citizenship, we will make the social injustice of malnutrition pass on to history," said Tracey Ullman, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition to the public, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
Furthermore, the group has said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken in the United Kingdom to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, through which 5 million women and children will be assisted through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to this FAQ question on their website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and apartheid movements that preceded us, we too will succeed, for we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe, among others, will be present at this year's New York show.
US could use Army to slow Russian energy exports as 'block' - Home Secretary
If "needed" Washington could use its Army to avoid Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, has been reported by U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke has stated that Russia's relationship with Syria - which is obviously operating there as required by the legitimate government - is merely an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy, the way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he stated.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to handle it.
"The United States, with our Army, has the ability to make sure that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees of an event organized by the Alliance of Energy for Consumers, which is an event organized by a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of consumer energy" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, clarifying that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic opportunity we have with regard to Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "single resource economy" with a dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements come when Trump's administration has been on a replacement mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's administration officials, and U.S. President Donald Trump, themselves, try to persuade Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project that makes Berlin Moscow a "gatekeeper" of Trump's terms.
Moscow has insisted that the $11 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is simply caused by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we can agree that energy can't be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose providers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been met with negative reception from Germany and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries, has asked the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "scan" to run for president after the midterm legislative elections.
Warren confirmed that he would be considering running for office in a city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires there to be a woman upstairs," he said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will be deeply considering running for president."
Warren voiced his opinion on Donald Trump at City Hall, stating that he was "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has spoken out openly when criticizing Trump and his candidate for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published Friday, Warren said, "Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
Nonetheless, a poll published on Thursday has shown that most of Warren's constituents do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight per cent of Massachusetts' "most likely" electors said the senator should not run for president, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent favored the introduction.
According to the poll, there is more support for the possibility of introducing former governor Deval Patrick, who has been backed by 38 per cent for a possible introduction and 48 per cent against.
Other names revealed in regards to a possible 2020 presentation include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin referred to Track Palin's post-trauma stress disorder during Donald Trump's election appearance
Track Palin, a 26-year-old, spent a year in Iraq after entering Iraq in September.
He was arrested and charged on Monday night for domestic violence.
"Because of what my son is suffering from, what he is suffering from when he returns, I feel identified with the other families who suffer from the effects of stress disorder after trauma and the vulnerabilities that our soldiers bring back," he told the public at an election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said the arrest was a "significant affair" and said of his son and other war veterans "They come back a little changed, they come back tough, they come back asking if there is any respect for what the other soldiers who are members of the army and all the other members of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a woman, including a declaration of domestic violence and possession of a weapon that he was intoxicated, according to police spokesman Dan Bennett of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. protect the impugnance of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are sponsoring legal impugnance to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who are fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts issued a friendly statement Friday supporting an asylum seeker in Washington, defying the police, NBC News reported.
It has not been revealed against federal policy the full name of the petitioner for Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Union for Civil Liberties in August.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members" had caused her sexual abuse, but US officials denied her a request for asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state's lawyers who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as creating a large number of U.S. asylum seekers who are countries with problems largely spread by gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a decision made by the Immigrants' Appeals Committee that allowed non-documented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that "the new police ignores years of state, federal, and international law."
"The federal law states that all asylum requests should be assigned based on the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar violates that principle," the amicus curiae statement reported.
In addition, lawyers argued in writing that policies denying access to migrants harm the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become activists and provide "the necessary hand of work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims who were fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"The asylum is available for those who fear persecution of their country or membership of a race, religion, nationality or social group or political opinion to leave their country," Sessions said when he introduced the policy on June 11.
Asilo in itself has never been for everyone to solve every problem that people experience every day, no matter how serious the problems.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu, while the number of dead has doubled, race to find survivors
For those who survived, the situation became more and more serious.
"It feels great," said mother Risa Kusuma, 35, who had a fever as she calmed her baby son in the destroyed city of Palu.
"The ambulance brings casualties every minute.
It lacks clean water."
The inhabitants have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, taking their belongings from the water, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, flooded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with broken backs and shoulders, were laid to rest outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to constant replication.
Tears fell from his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent movement of the earthquake when he was in the hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save our minds.
I think I crushed myself against the remains of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town because of a marriage.
"I heard his wife call for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope they will be well."
U.S. ambassador to China accused of "attacking" with propaganda advertisements
After an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China in an ABE newspaper, the U.S. ambassador has accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States The Chinese newspaper in Des Moines Register, the second-most-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, cited the extra fee last Wednesday after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 United States congressional election. China denies the accusation.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections has been marked by what U.S. officials told Reuters; he was mounting a new campaign in Washington to pressure China.
While it is natural for foreign governments to place banners to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked from a rising trade war in which each country has placed thorns to the imports of the other.
China's retaliatory vestiges, early in the trade war, supported Trump's Republican Party with the intention of attacking exports from Iowa-like states, experts from China and the US have stated.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Iowa, i.e., a state that exports the most agricultural goods to China, has stated that Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad has stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register that "China is now strengthening its attack by placing propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading propaganda, he is making use of the American free press and a strong tradition of press freedom by placing paid advertisements by the Chinese government in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the press kiosk here on Beijing Street, there is little dissident voice and no real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese people may have in regard to China's troubled economic career, because the media are subject to firm control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish his article," but did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare female voters ahead of midterm legislative election with Kavanaugh debate, analysts warn
As many high-ranking Republicans are waiting and defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a decline, particularly among women, in the next legislative midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this matter have been very great, and most Republicans are registered showing that they want to go on with the vote.
There is no turning back on these matters," Grant Reeher, Professor of the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in regards to an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts about whether the pressure on Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to support an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said senior advisor Karine Jean-Pierre and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to Washington, D.C..
On Friday morning, protesters shouting "It's coming November!" were protesting in front of the Senate that Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee had decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony there, she stated in Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be out of place," said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news website.
"People say he's had a great influence already; that's true.
But it could still have a greater impact, particularly among suburban women and young people who don't have a fixed vote, between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that they often don't vote even if they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony against the Supreme Court candidate revealed details of sexual assault, analysts suggested that there could be a decline if Republicans decided to proceed with confirmation.
"It's become a big shock for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"The question is not whether the board vote, the final vote, or Kavanaugh should sit in the chair of the defendants, it is also a question of how republicans have handled this matter and how they have treated the woman," explained the director of the group helping the news channel select Democrat Guy Cecil "Priorities USA."
At any rate, the Americans seem rather divided between Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses in deciding to whom they believe, but more people seem to favor the latter.
A recent poll by YouGov shows that 41% of those involved believed Ford's testimony with certainty or possibly, while 35% believed Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied in his statement, and 30% said the same thing in regards to Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and by at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, has reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him while drunk when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court candidate showed him geniuses while they were at a party at Yale when they were students in the 1980s.
Who invented the World Wide Web, plans to launch a new Internet to support Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the World Wide Web, wants to set up a startup with the goal of promoting Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The ultimate technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's Solid free software platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt being to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-dos lists, calendar, music storage, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify: they're all available in one browser, and all together.
The distinctive thing about online personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to access information of a certain type.
The company calls it "The Empowerment of People by Data."
According to Executive Director John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put resources, processes and the right skills in place to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not ""talking to Facebook and Google about the need to make a complete change when their business models change completely from day to day.
"We're not asking permission from them."
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to put together an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed it when he founded the Internet World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the time of Inrupt's launch, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the future of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: cleric honoured with Victoria Cross of the First World War
As a soldier of the First World War he has been honored as the only clergyman of the Church of England who has received the Victoria Cross, in his village, 100 years later.
The Reverend Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew that he had received the highest British award for military honour.
A memorial stone was displayed by his two grandchildren in a quarry at Rushden in Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "very symbolic" that the stone should be awarded his grandfather's prize and displayed 100 years later.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Channel from Saint-Quentin "that the fog was very close and under constant fire from cannons and machine guns".
Then he hurried to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage led the line forward until he found a cannon himself alone and threw three of the detachment to the ground.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew his grandfather's actions "could never have been done by him, but that gives him great humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, established a wreath of flowers after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Vann said that it was "a great honour for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support many people will give him."
MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but were replaced by Peppa Pig.
Let's say you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 full of people, and then they don't let you see the main show.
The San Jose sign had 13 fights, six in the main calendar, and was scheduled to be broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the audience in the United Kingdom was shocked when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised to find themselves awake until the small hours of the morning specifically for the fight.
One follower described the change in Twitter for children's cartoons as "a joke of bad taste".
"A government law states that this content was not appropriate by 6 a.m., and they had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, chief vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the show.
""Peppa pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will look into programming to take the audience in the United Kingdom into consideration in the future.
"I think when I think of repetition, I think we can probably fix it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't fix that until it's Sunday at our hour, Monday at their hour.
But we're working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made there were lots of messages going on and on, and not all of them were very nice.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen again next time.
We're going to put five fights instead of six, the way we normally do, so we tried to offer people more, and we screwed up.
Unfortunately, it's a situation that's going to happen."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'rejected' with regard to sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling underestimated for sex, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "they weren't all like him."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she had spoken of giving others "hope" about homosexual rights.
He also said that parenting made winning the Olympic games less important.
The program's longtime host, Kirsty Young, has been on vacation for several months for the disease.
After appearing completely lost on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "deeply disappointed" by everyone else because society didn't allow him to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, the feelings that make you feel despised and different from others have been the real reasons that have given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" because, in his words, he didn't want to disappoint people when they heard about his sexuality.
The sportsperson who won two bronze medals at the Olympic Games has become a high-profile LGBT promoter, and used his participation at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he gave his opinion because he felt he was lucky to be able to live in an open mode without suffering the consequences and because he wanted to "give hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised him."
Daley married the winner of the rainbow 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference hasn't been a problem among themselves.
He said that "when you're so young and there's so much going on in you" - he went to the Olympic games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died with cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone the same age who's had similar incidents.
The couple became parents of their son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley has said that his "full vision" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, 'I have to win a gold medal' was the only thing I had in mind," he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than the gold medals in the Olympic games.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with mental cancer.
Daley said his father didn't approve of him going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be on the front line.
"I couldn't say to him, 'You're not in a position to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing, and I stopped breathing and didn't accept until she died," he said.
The next day Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics, and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed all my life: to put myself in front of the local public at the Olympic games, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first choice of songs - Proud, Heather Small's - that made him feel identified throughout the whole process of preparing for the Olympic games and still kick ass.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not being in form, remained on the bench on Saturday in the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson will make the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to improve his form to avoid looking bad.
Mickelson was breaking the record by playing the event 12 times every two years; however, he was sent to the chair by captain Jim Fury in Saturday's four-ball and foursome fashions.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has been many times for the United States, the man who has been champion five times split the day to be a cheerleader on one side and to play the game on the field on the other, hoping to correct what makes him suffer.
He was never the straightest of the drivers, nor at the best moment of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the best choice for the competitive dynamics of Le Golf National, because the toughest players dominate those who are lost.
And even though the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in his ninth game on Sunday, will have to face Francesco Molina, the champion of the British Open, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of this week's games.
If the Americans, starting 12 games in singles below four points, have a good start, Mickelson's game could be decisive altogether.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, who could not say much more.
"He understood the role he had today very well, he tapped me on the back, and he said he'd be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a top-notch sportsman and he's given these teams a lot in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't watch two games.
I expected more, but that's what happened, and we felt like we had to do it.
He wants to be there like everyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record as the player who played the most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may be the end of Ryder Cup professional career that has never reached its individual mark again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and has been stopped seven times, however, according to Furyk, he has brought something untouchable to the team.
"It makes him laugh, and he's sarcastic and intelligent, and he usually makes fun of people, and it's great to have his presence," he declares.
"Young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it was fun to watch.
He does much more than play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows that the great advantage they have can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that despite the great advantage in the final day's individual round, the Ryder Cup tournament can easily become an uncomfortable situation.
In 1997, he had his Danish debut at Valderrama.There, under Seve Ballesteros, his team had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but they narrowly won the tournament with scores of 141 -2 and 131 -2.
"I constantly remind myself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama and barely won, and we lost at Brookline even though we had a great advantage," said Bjorn (pictured), after winning the 2018 class 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday, taking a 10 to 6 advantage at Le Golf National.
So history tells us both me and all the team that this is not over yet.
We're going to take full action tomorrow.
We'll go out into the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until the points are in the clipboard.
We're going to win the trophy, and we're going to focus on that.
As I've always said, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the opposite side: some of the best players in the world."
Dissatisfied with the achievements of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn has also said, "I never want to advance anything.
Tomorrow.
It's the individual's turn tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a member when things are going well, but when you're alone, every golf player has to prove his full ability.
That's the message you have to transmit to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now, forget about your comrades, for they too must come out at their best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team is hoping that his players will play better individually than as members, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have scored three out of four points.
Fury himself has been in the same position on both sides of these last day's changes of direction as a member of the winning Brookline team and later lost to the European team when the Europeans performed the so-called "Medina miracle".
"I remember every word he said," he said, when we asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, encouraged the players on the last day.
"We've got 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep the advantage from the start, like Brookline and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there is a lot of pressure in those intermediate games.
We've decided on that list of players, and we're hoping to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of counterattacking, and Rory McIlroy will be the opponent in the final match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the upper middle order.
"I chose that team in that order because they're in a position to go all the way," Bjorn said of the individuals selected.
Further delays in the construction of the new German battleship.
The new German marina frigate had to be ordered in 2014 to replace the old Cold War era battleships, but will not be built until at least next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media say.
The request for a battleship called "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship had to be entered into the marina in 2014, but eleven issues after delivery have prevented this ambitious project from being completed.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by Marina in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It appears to have a powerful cannon, technology for carrying out anti-aircraft and surface-to-air missile features and hidden actions (e.g., restricted radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have longer maintenance capabilities: the newest frigates can stay out of their original ports for up to two years.
However, due to constant delays, these warships with cutting-edge technology (which Germany intends to project its power to them) will become obsolete by the time they enter service, says the Die Zeit newspaper.
F125 frigate that ended badly made a lot of noise in your media last year, because the German army officially rejected the ship's request, and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the marina had returned a ship to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
The reasons for the return are not known, but the German media cited serious "software and hardware flaws"; as a result, the battleship would be unusable if it were to be used in combat missions.
Particularly important were software errors, the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by 120 sailors, that is, half of those aboard the Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the vessel has too much weight and as a result its performance is greatly reduced, and it is more difficult for the marina to add novelty in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice the number of similar class ships used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price of the entire project (including triage training) is also a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.100 million, from the €2,200 it should have cost at first.
The problems of the new frigates are even more important in the face of warnings that the power of the German navy is being reduced.
Just a few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "useful ships" are being exhausted.
The representative has said that the problem increases more and more because after the retirement of the old vessels no replacement has been provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate had entered the marina.
The secret life of bats has been observed by the National Trust.
A new study has been done on a plot of ground in the Scottish mountains to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food.
They are hoping to get more information about the behavior of these special flying mammals so that they can better determine their activities to protect them in the future.
Research being carried out by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) will track common and soprano dwarf bats as well as large-eared and Daubenton bats in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations, and the activities of bats will be monitored throughout the season.
UK health system (NHS) personnel will also perform mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts perform a sound analysis of all the recorders, they will know the frequency of the bat calls, as well as what each species does.
Subsequently, a map and report of the habitat will be made to obtain a detailed landscape-scale image of the behaviour of the bats.
Rob Deware, a consultant for nature protection at NTS, believes that the most important areas of bat habitat will be determined, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will determine the advantages of the job of treating habitat, e.g. the creation of lawns, and how to best maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat population in Scotland as well as throughout the United Kingdom declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects their nests and loses their habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning also carry the risk, including fly catch papers, chemical treatments in construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, as they hunt in the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes at the moment of prey acquisition.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect bugs and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres in Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
He has ten trained experts who regularly make observations, surveys of nests, and sometimes rescues.
In fact, the organisation has created Scotland's first and only bat reservation on the land of Dumfries and the Threave of Galloway, where eight of Scotland's ten bat species live.
David Thompson, the manager of the estate, says the land is perfect for them.
"We have a great field for Threaven's bats," he said.
"We have old buildings and many years of trees; the habitat is very suitable.
However, there are still many things unknown about bats, so thanks to the work we do here and on other land, we will understand what they need to be healthy."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check if there are bats before performing maintenance on the benefits, since if the single maternal nest is accidentally destroyed, 400 female bats and young bats may be killed, and perhaps thus the entire local population could disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them, as well as to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, who represents the bat protection organization, has asked the general population for help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us are."
Ronaldo dismisses rape allegations while his lawyers rush to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the rape allegations against him are "false news" and that those who have made it through his name only want to "publish."
His lawyers are preparing to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who has published the complaint.
Portuguese and Juventus frontman Kathryn Mayorga has been accused of rape in Las Vegas in 2009.
After this, he allegedly paid her $375,000 in exchange for keeping the event secret, Der Spiegel stated on Friday.
A few hours after the accusation was released, Ronaldo, who is 33, made a live video for his 142 million followers on the platform, in which he said the allegations are "false news".
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the footballer who won the Golden Ball five times in front of the camera.
"They want to get publicity by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to achieve fame by telling me my name, but that's what happens in my profession.
I am a happy man, and all is well," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel on the allegations, which they say are "an unacceptable publication on suspicions that affect privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will demand compensation "as far as the gravity of the violation is concerned, which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a Palms hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her from the ukulele, according to the district court documents in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga has stated that Ronaldo got down on his knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "a good man at 99 per cent" but that he missed "a hundred per cent."
The documents say that Ronaldo confessed that the couple had sex, but that the relationship had been allowed.
Mayorga has also said that she went to the police, and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later reached an agreement outside the courthouse because she was "deeply scared" by the reprisals, and because she was "deeply worried about being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman said she wants the deal back because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he left for Italy's big team Juve, under a £100 million deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom will 'forever regret' loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom will "forever regret" to step down as head of auto manufacturers after the "Brexit", business secretary Greg Clark said.
He has also said that it is "exclusive" that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without a deal, it will halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
Japan's auto manufacturer has said that delays that would result in a "Brexit" with no deal could result in a loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, and 90 percent of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement by the end of March, production of our factory will be halted," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed fears that they may not know how trade between borders will work if they leave the European Union without an agreement.
BMW, for example, said it will close its Mini factory for a month after the "Brexit".
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks surrounding the supply chain if the "Brexit" is carried out without an agreement.
Toyota's production line is "current", and the pieces arrive every 37 minutes, both from suppliers in the United Kingdom and the European Union, for cars produced on demand.
If the United Kingdom leaves the European Union without an agreement on 29 March, interruptions may occur at the borders and, as a result, delays and lack of paperwork.
It would not be possible for Toyota to retain more than one day's inventory at the Derbyshire factory; as a result, production should be halted.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations of the European Union "is strictly measured to avoid these customs checks."
"We want the best deal, not just to assure current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Other manufacturers besides Toyota have proven that it is vital that highly successful supply chains continue to do so."
Toyota has not been able to indicate how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, due to additional costs, the factory's competitiveness would be reduced and, as a result, it warned that jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is coordinator of the Unite union factory, has said that the members are becoming more and more concerned: "I say with confidence that if we lose these jobs, we won't take them back.
A government spokesman has said, "We have put forward a detailed and credible plan for future relations with the European Union."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House said.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "another week behind schedule" as the conflict surrounding Brett Kavanaugh's run for Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the impact of Russia on American elections, the link between Trump's supporters and Russia, and the alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will release his replacement attorney general and thereby endanger Muelle's independence has been debated in Washington over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered carrying a hidden microphone to record his talks with Trump, as well as removing the president from his post in accordance with Article 25 of the US constitution.
Rosenstein cancelled the information.
However, he went to the White House last Monday while information was released that he would resign.
Instead, he stated that he would have a meeting with Trump on Thursday at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump has said he prefers not to dismiss Rosenstein, but later postponed the meeting in order not to conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee; on that committee, Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexually assaulting him, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has further delayed Senate voting.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "The date has not yet been set; it may be this week, but I would like to understand the delay in another week, considering everything that is going on in the Supreme Court.
However, we shall see; I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists may not agree with this statement very much: in fact, Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked him the reason for that.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences has not been that TV journalists are "great," but he has said, "I agree they're great."
He has subsequently suggested that the direct relationship between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president makes far more attempts to answer questions than his predecessors," he said, and added without mentioning the evidence: "We have verified these statistics."
Sanders said they will continue to hold press conferences, but "if the press can ask the President of the United States questions directly, that's much better than asking me.
We try to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've done it many times in the last few weeks, and that will replace the press conference when we're given a chance to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House, during open sessions, or during press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
He doesn't usually do his own self-proclaimed press conferences.
The possible reason for this has been uncovered by the President of the United States this week in New York, when he made a spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the journalists gathered there.
UK health department secretariat writes a letter to European Union workers working in Scotland's NHS system over concerns about 'Brexit'
The health department's secretariat has written to European Union employees working in Scotland's NHS health system to thank them on behalf of the whole country, and to urge them to stop there after the "Brexit".
Scotland's parliamentarian Jeane Freeman has written that there are less than six months left for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.
The Scottish government has already agreed to take over the cost of requests for "settled status" of European Union citizens working in public services.
This is what Freeman has said in his letter: "During the summer, negotiations on the 'Brexit' have been going on between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and some decision is expected to be reached by the autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government has intensified its preparations for a possible non-treatment exit.
I know it's a very troubled time for you all.
That is why I want to confirm that I highly appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Members of the European Union, as well as those outside of it, bring useful experiences and capabilities, and improve the work of the health service, for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home without a doubt, and we hope to live by it."
Emergency operator Christion Abercrombie injured in head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, has been operated on emergency after suffering a head injury on Saturday after losing 31 to 27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, as reported by Mike Organ of Tennesse.
Rod Reed, the Tennessee State team's head coach, said the player suffered a head injury shortly before the game's mid-season break.
"He's gone over to the side band and fainted," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel have given Abercrombie oxygen in the band itself, and taken him to a bed for further medical examination.
A representative of the Tennessee State team told Chris Harris of the WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee, that he has gone out of operation and is in the medical center of Vanderbilt.
Harris has said that they "have not yet given any details on the type of wound or its severity", and are trying to determine when the wound occurred on the Tennessee State team.
He is in his second year with the Abercrombie Redshirts, and his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, with a total of 18 tackles all season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tincture when buying onions in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tinder when buying onibars in the United Kingdom, and this additional amount will be used to help those who have become homeless, following the Conservative Party's plans.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
For those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, there will be an increase in the tax on tinsel.
The Treasury estimates they will collect an additional £120 million per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on tinder when buying onibars in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to help those who have become homeless for an additional amount, Theresa May said today.
This strategy aims to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters; Corbyn has pledged to provide housing with reasonable prices and to collect more taxes from those with the most income.
For people and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom the increase in the tax on tinsel will be, and it will be used by the government for efforts to reduce people who sleep on the streets for the additional amount collected.
Overcharge, which is an additional tax on the current timbre (including higher taxes for second homes entered two years ago and for properties purchased for rent), can amount to up to three per cent.
The Public Treasure is estimated to collect an additional £120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the goods built in London are bought by people who do not live in the United Kingdom; as a result, prices rise and it is harder for those who want to buy for the first time to enter the housing market.
The rich areas of the country, especially those of the capital, have become "muggler villages", since foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the city.
This new policy comes just after Boris Johnson's demand to reduce the tax on tinkering to help young people buy their first home.
The purchase and use of land has been charged by large construction companies to keep the prices of the property high, and has prompted May to set aside a reasonable priced housing fee for resolving the "homestead crisis" in Britain."
Corbyn has introduced, in turn, a series of attractive reforms to housing, including rent control and "unreasonable" homelessness.
In addition, it wants to give municipalities more power to build more housing.
May has said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my presidency to restoring the British dream, to improving the lives of each new generation.
That means repairing the rotten housing market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and organize their lives there.
However, the fact that it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for British residents working hard for foreign companies to purchase housing is not fair.
For too many people, the dream of owning an apartment has become too far gone, and we still have the dignity of those who have to sleep on the streets."
Jack Ross: "Being Scotland's team coach is my greatest wish"
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, says his "greatest wish" is to someday coach the Scotland team.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the north-east club, who are in third place in League One, three points from first place.
He came to the Stadium of Light this summer, after returning St Mirren's team to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to be a player for my country.
I won a trophy in the B League, and that was it," said Ross on BBC Scotland's Sportssound programme.
"But I used to watch Scottish games in Hampden with my father, and I've always had the urge to come back.
However, I would only have a chance if I had the ability to manage the club."
Among those who had coached at Sunderland before Ross, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former boss has said that he did not feel nervous about coming up behind such big names, as he had previously refused to offer to coach Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"To measure success, I'll have to ask myself, 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
Given the structure and facilities of the club, it should definitely be in the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as successful if I don't succeed in doing it."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, at one time as an assistant to Dumbarton's boss and one of Hearts' training staff after working for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa recover after dropping down to third, and thanks to him too, he moved on from being promoted to St Mirren to become champion the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Maybe it was a real crossroad for me," he said of Alloa's taking charge.
"I really believed that being a coach was the best function for me, rather than being a player.
That's funny to say, because I was a good player, I made a good living, and I lived some important moments of fame.
But it can be hard to play.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of work, but I'm happy as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and, now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever before."
The full interview will be broadcast on 30 September (Sunday) on Radio Scotland's Sportsound between 12:00 and 13:00 (BST).
Five-and-a-half Saturday is the best time to have a drink, according to a poll.
Thanks to the summer heat wave, the income of British pubs has increased greatly, but pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
Pub- and bar-chain sales have risen 2.7 per cent, but restaurant sales have fallen 4.8 per cent, the data says.
Peter Martin, who works on CGA business advice that has collected data, says: "Since the sun has hit continuously, and England's team has held more than expected in the World Football Championships, July's data is similar to June's, where pub revenues have risen 2.8 per cent, but restaurants's have dropped even further.
Even though the June sales of restaurants have dropped by 1.8, they have been even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that specialize in drinks have had much better performance, and their rise has been greater than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs that specialize in food have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want a drink.
Pub and bar drink sales have risen 6.6 per cent in the past month, while food sales have fallen 3 per cent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hosting analyst at RSM, has said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of social events and sports are the most important factors in terms of trade sales outside of the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains have economic constraints, and a 4.8 per cent drop in sales from year to year will cause important damage, in addition to the continued pressures around the cost.
The long, hot summer is coming at a perfect time for establishments that specialize in food, and it is to be seen whether the moderate temperatures in August will give them any relief."
The increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including those of newly opened establishments, was 2.7 per cent in July, with chain expansion slowing down.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index oversees sector sales in relation to pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, collected and analysed performance data from 47 groups of operators, which together have revenues of more than £9 billion. This index is considered the industry reference point.
One in five children have accounts hidden from their parents on social networks
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a poll.
In a poll conducted on 20,000 secondary school students, they were able to see that "false Instagram accounts" have gone up.
Because of this news, there has been a growing fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "major" account that their parents can see.
But one in five children (some as young as 11) have accounts on social networks that hide them from adults.
In a poll conducted on 20,000 secondary school students, you can see that many "false Instagram accounts" have been uploaded ( Instagram is a photo sharing website).
Because of this news, there has been an increased fear that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clean "primary" account that their parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website where a teenager called the others "borrow me."
This study by Digital Awareness UK and the "Director's Conference" (HMC) of independent schools illustrates that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, of which half acknowledge that they have private accounts.
In the words of HMC head Mike Buchanan: "It's worrying that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle will be a 'speaker of athletes' at the Scottish athletics committee
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed ex-executive director of the Scottish athletics committee at this year's general assembly of the board of directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized athlete, and director Ian Beattie has said that those who lead the sport with this change have an excellent opportunity to make use of his extensive international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has tremendous respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world, and we know that it will be very useful for Scottish athletics to be on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle has said, "I have a strong desire to be an athlete's spokesperson, and I hope to make a great contribution, and guide the sport in Scotland."
The American won the 200-metre and 400-metre races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and has four gold medals in total. To date, he is a BBC announcer, who recently lost his ability to walk because of a transient ischemic heart attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said he was to see if I would restore, or to what degree.
It's been really hard, but I've completely recovered, I've had to learn how to walk again, and I've been doing some skills exercises today!
Thank you for the messages you sent me to give encouragement!"
An advertisement for a milk outlet comparing mothers to cows has elicited contrary opinions on the Internet.
A dairy outlet company has posted contrasting opinions on the Internet, compared to cows milked by breastfed people.
To present what they say is "the world's first silent milking laptop", consumer technology company Elvie has released a joke ad inspired by a music video to show the freedom of the new device to mothers who make milk.
Four women who are really mothers dance in a stable full of straw, with a song that has these and similar words: "Yeah, I milk myself, but I don't stick," and "Maybe you haven't noticed, but these aren't my udders, they're my boobs."
This is the motto: "Get out the milk, get out the milk, give the babies, get out the milk, get out the milk, I'm milking my girls."
However, this announcement that the company has posted on its Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a wide variety of reactions from viewers, many of whom have said that it doesn't take the milk industry's "horrorities" seriously.
"It has been a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they too must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their young are stolen a few days after birth," said one user.
Elvie milking can be discreetly inserted into a breastplate (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else has said, "Very traumatic, of course, for the mother and baby.
But, well, why not use it for advertising a milk outlet for mothers who don't take their children away?"
Someone else has added, "This advertisement has no kindness."
Others, however, defended the announcement, with one woman admitting that she found it "laughable to explode."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I made milk I felt like I was a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but that's the point.
It's a great product," wrote one user.
Another has commented, "It's an advertisement that's fun, aimed at mothers who make milk (often in workplaces or in the bathroom) because they feel like they're 'cows'."
He has no intention of praising or judging the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with milk in their breast.
Many women who make milk feel like they are cows are taken into account during the campaign.
Elvie's milking door, however, is perfectly silent, and she has no cable or tube, and she can wear it discreetly on one of her breastfeedings, move women as she pleases, have babies on her arms, or be able to go out into the street.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and executive creative director, has commented: "Elvie's milking is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and challenging presentation.
With this similarity between the women and the milk cows who make milk, we wanted to highlight the process of making milk and all its challenges, and also express in an entertaining and approachable way the freedom afforded by milking.
This is not the first time that Elvie's milking has attracted attention.
During the London fashion week, a mother with two children appeared in the pass to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of children are taken to a quiet emigrant camp on the Texas border.
The number of child emigrants who have been apprehended has increased greatly in recent times, although the monthly surveillance on the border is roughly the same; one reason for this is because the rhetoric and harsh guidelines of Trump's administration have made it more difficult for children to be brought to sponsors.
So far, undocumented immigrants have been the majority of sponsors themselves, but now they're afraid to register to protect their children, because they might lose the power to stay in the US.
The risk increased in June, because federal authorities said that those who wanted to be sponsors and other adults living in their homes would have to issue fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, one of America's immigration and customs security officers, testified before Congress that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied to protect minors who arrived without an adult.
That agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of them had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80 per cent of the refugees or those who live with them are illegal in our country, and many of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're still picking them up," Albence said.
To process the children's condition more quickly, the officers have created new rules that, according to them, must appear in court within a month's time after the detection of the children, and not after 60 days as before, in the words of the shelters' staff.
Many of them will appear on a video conference call asking an immigration judge for legal status.
If it is determined that they are not eligible for assistance, they will be deported immediately.
The longer the child spends in the care centers, the more likely they are to increase their anxiety and depression, which could result in violent outbursts or attempts to escape, depending on the shelter staff and the reports that have been made on the system in recent months.
Defenders of children claim that these concerns increase in large facilities like Tornillo, since it is so large that there is a greater probability that children's problems will be ignored.
They have also said that if children are taken to camp to prepare emotionally or without the time to say goodbye to their friends, the trauma they already have may increase.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to exit immediately
At the United Nations General Assembly, foreign affairs minister Walid al-Moualem has also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the prime minister's replacement, has said that foreign forces are illegal in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they will be "treated in due course".
"They have to get out of the country immediately and without any conditions," he said on the committee.
Moualem has said that Syria's "war on terrorism is almost over"; 360,000 people have been killed in that war since 2011, and millions have been forced to leave their homes.
He has said that Damascus will "continue to fight in the holy battle" "until we wipe out all Syria's territory" as well as "from foreign terrorist groups."
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the country that has been destroyed by the war.
In regards to the issue of refugees, Moualem has said that there are adequate conditions for them to return, and has attributed to some "Western countries" for spreading "an irrational fear" that urges refugees to stay outside.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable these returns," he said.
"They're politicizing everything but the humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that aid for the reconstruction of Syria will not be given until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Recently, Russia and Turkey have made an agreement to create a safe haven in the last stronghold the rebels have in Idlib; United Nations diplomats believe it is possible to foster political dialogue thanks to it.
This agreement between Russia and Turkey avoided a large-scale attack by Syrian forces in this province, which has a population of three million.
However, Moualem has said that the agreement has clear "limit-of-day" provisions, and stated that military action will target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-related Nusra front fighters, who will be "deused".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of the new assembly will be held between the government and members of the opposition, to begin forming a constitution following the war, as well as paving the way for elections.
Moualem has imposed conditions for the Syrian government to participate in this assembly, stating that the work of the assembly should be restricted to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warning that no one else should be involved.
Why Trump will win for the second time
Following this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless (as many Democratic Party viewers probably expected) a process of impeachment or scandals ends his presidency prematurely.
That would be the most dramatic end of a presidency!
At the moment, the audience doesn't seem tired.
As of 2014, the majority viewership on CNN's daytime schedule has almost doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and tripled on MSNBC's, to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers on that schedule, which is up 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen's data.The MSNBC show The Rachel Maddow Show has the largest cable television audience, and has managed up to 3.5 million viewers on nights when important news has occurred.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what's going on," says Neal Baer, director of the ABC network's "Designated Survivor." After the Capitol is destroyed by an attack, Baer's show is about a cabinet chief who becomes president.
The highly experienced comedy-guitarist and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, ("Only funny things: the hard truth about joining the Hollywood multiples club") has another theory.
Prior to the 2016 election, while he was in a taxi in Boston,
The driver said he would give the vote to Trump.
Scovell asked why.
"Because he said it made him laugh," Scovell said.
There is also time for entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington determine the future of abortion law, the families of immigrants can regroup, and the health of the world economy.
Only high-priority viewers have the option to disconnect.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching a debate of experts on a variety of topics: how Bob Woodward has used "deep anticipation" to write the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich skin jacket ("dressed in ruins" in The Washington Post), and the funny way Stormy Daniels describes Trump's "anatomy".
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Wheelhouse Entertainment's executive director and founder of "Pawn Stars" Brent Montgomery says this about the changing characters and arguments of Trump's show (a debate with the national football league, praising Kim Jong-un): "It gives the feeling of being a reality show, because it gives you something to consume every day."
You can't lose any parts, or you'll stay behind.
When I met with Fleiss this week, she was 26 degrees and it was sunny in her house on the north shore of Kauai, but she was stuck inside the house watching MSNBC while she recorded CNN.
He could not desist from television, particularly now, that Brett Kavanaugh must appear before the Senate judicial power committee, and that the future of the Supreme Court hangs.
"When I used to do those funny TV shows, people used to say it was the end of Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but apparently they were right."

The money out there is being slashed in the most equal-at-large elections in the legislature of the United States.
It is not surprising to learn that money is being slashed in Pennsylvania's 17th district; in fact, Congressional resolutions have been reorganized, resulting in two headlines competing for the same chair.
In the district surrounding Pittsburg where the boundaries have recently been reorganized, they are represented by Conor Lamb of the Democrat Party, who obtained his seat in the special election of another district.
There is another headline by opponent Lamb, who is the Republican Party's Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that the boundaries of the districts were manipulated against what the constitution says in favor of the Republicans. As a result of this ruling, the boundaries of the maps were properly delineated.
This competition in the new 17th district has resulted in a close contest for campaign funding on major party funding sources: the Democratic campaign congressional committee (DCCC) and the Republican campaign national committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania for he won the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District special election in March.
The chair was owned by a Republican for the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point advantage, in addition.
In terms of political statements, the Democrats have a bit of an advantage.
US considers punishing El Salvador for standing up for China, but then rejects decision
Diplomats have stated that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged that Beijing, Washington has hardly asked them to back down.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to dump Trump's organizational management team.
The state department's officers decided to take the American commanders of diplomatic missions out of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, following "new decisions to stop acknowledging Taiwan," said department spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement early this month.
However, sanctions were considered to only be made against El Salvador, which received $140 million as aid from the United States in 2017, including to control drug trafficking, promote development, and help the economy.
Among the penalties proposed are the reduction of economic aid and specific visa restrictions, which would be highly damaging to the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, officers in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, aimed at making the vein a successor to a similar meeting held the previous year, and it was considered an advance in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administrative officers made it clear that they wanted to hold a conference, and thus made it clear that the consideration of sanctions being imposed on El Salvador had been abandoned.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference which has moved to the middle of October, a sign of the importance of the administration to the meeting, in the words of diplomats.
Three American envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no harsh messages or punishments from Washintongo.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House has denied making any statement about the details of the dispute by three American officers, including two diplomats who have agreed to report internal disputes in exchange for preserving anonymity.
An analyst who has worked closely with the administration and has also spoken anonymously has confirmed what they have said.

The report of Attorney General Robert Mueller will soon be released, which will indicate whether Trump interfered with justice; there is much evidence of this in the public mind.
In addition, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump's campaign was a friend of Russia's in the US election.
If a majority of Congress is changed by party, Trump will have to give instructions while preparing to appear before voters (and, if necessary, a jury of his equals) again.
There are many conditions for it, however, and I don't mean Trump's inevitable decline in del nor Trump's most European equivalent.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and it will be determined by them how long the conflict will be.
In 1938, the German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, if the Western countries had supported him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years after that.
We have covered history with such points of inflection, which precipitate or delay the accidental progress of democracy.
Americans are faced with so many points of inflection right now.
What are we going to do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein? Roseinsten is the one who controls what will happen with the Mueller investigation.
Rosenstein's position has been in danger since this newspaper last year reported that he had suggested recording the president in silence, and that he had declared the president unfit for office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times said is wrong.
"How can we answer about Brett Kavanaugh if the recent FBI investigation is not complete or fair, or if he receives confirmation to be a judge of the Supreme Court, even though credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony have been made against him?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm legislative elections as to form a Congress that will claim responsibility to Trump?
If we don't pass those tests, it will be a red winter for democracy.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers Feels Positive Against Rapid Vienne
Rapid Vienne will host Rangers Thursday.They know that if they beat the Austrians, after a thrilling draw a few weeks ago with Villarreal of Spain, they will be left in a perfect position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Due to an injury to his knee by midfielder Graham Dorrans he was unable to make his first appearance of the season until the 2nd and 2nd draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use that as a trap for better things.
"It was a good result, as well as a good opponent for Villarreal," the 31-year-old said.
"We played to get something, and we ended up getting a point.
We may have had an opportunity to win at the end, but the result is a draw, if necessary.
In the first half they prevailed and in the second we were the masters.
Thursday night will be very important for the European championship.
We're hoping to get three points, but it's going to be difficult, because they had a good result in the last match, yet the audience is on our side, and I think we're going to go ahead and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult; I had injuries and changes were made at the club itself, but at the moment there is a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the guys are enjoying it; the training is good too.
I think we'll move on, forget about last season and make it a success."
Women are deeply concerned about a problem with their retirement savings.
The participants in the poll knew what kind of care they want to have, but very few have reported it to family members.
Half of those involved in the Nationwide study said they have talked to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 per cent have spoken about it with their children.
"We want some family members to expect us, but we don't dare to ask," Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide insurance company, explained.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be willing to take care of you unless you ask it first.
Interact with a counselor and family to agree on where and how you want to receive care, as these options will depend on the cost of care.
Ask a consultant for help: A consultant can help you find a way to pay those expenses.
You have more than one opportunity to fund long-term care, including: regular long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for the expenses of care in cash and the insurance that can be paid at the moment with your own money if you have that money.
Clear legal documents: forget legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health; also, make sure that you will be cared for as you wish if you are not able to be requested by the professionals.
Also, ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a reliable person to make financial choices on your behalf and, when you are unable to do so, to make sure you pay your bills.
Don't forget the details: suppose your parents are elderly and one of them has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
Write down these details to be prepared in a written plan.
"Finances are at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.

Man shot with air pistol in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with an air pistol after leaving the party while returning home.
The victim was 40-one years old, and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Police have described the shooting as "random", which occurred around 02:30 (UK summer time).
The victim did not see the attacker.
There are no serious injuries, but the police have appealed for help from witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials say the death toll will rise.
Because communications systems are cut off, aid officials have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the closest area to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, north of Palu.
Palun, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here is some important information about the city of Palu and the government of Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government run area of more than 300 miles (180 km) of the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowalin, on the other coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian table of disaster management (Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management), Paluk and Donggala have suffered numerous tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed, and hundreds of homes were destroyed in Donggala as a result of the tsunami.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred just west of Donggala, and nine people were killed.
Indonesia is located in a seismic zone called the "Pacific fire belt", which is why it is prone to frequent earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake struck off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, north of Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami that rocked 14 countries and caused 226,000 deaths along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which was in Aceh.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, several powerful earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred in southern Java (the island with the largest population in Indonesia), and triggered a tsunami.This tsunami severely affected the southern coast, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of southern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake occurred on one of the Mentawai islands near Sumtra, causing a maximum tsunami of 10 meters, resulting in the destruction of dozens of villages and the deaths of around 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya government of Aceh, and led to disaster and fear, as people remembered the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred at the time, but more than 100 people were killed by being crushed by buildings.
2018: Several major earthquakes occurred among tourists on the so-known Indonesian island of Lombok, and more than 500 people died, particularly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily left unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested over domestic violence charges
Trick Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested with assault charges.
Palin, 29, and born in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the accusation of domestic violence, and for opposing the authority, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers Division.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance started calling the police to report the alleged crime, Palin took her phone away.
According to KTUU, Palin is at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, a preventive detention facility and $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he made the allegorical statement, he said that he was "without question, innocent," the network reported.
Palin has been charged with three light A-level offenses, and could face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a mild B-level offense, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine possible.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, her father, Todd Palin, was accused of assault.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
Currently, the case is in the hands of the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, obstructing a domestic violence complaint, and having a gun when drunk.
The girlfriend stated that she had a crush on him.
When her son's aggressive behavior was associated with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by the Iraq experience, Sarah Palin received strong criticism in 2016.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami that has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are suspended, and the number of dead in the coming days is expected to rise.
The earthquake rocked the center of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are a number of videos that show the moment of impact on social networks.
In fact, because of a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami rocked the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants special death penalty for New York terrorist attack suspect
New York's federal prosecutor wants the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people; the last time such a penalty was imposed for a federal crime in the state was in 1953.
Supposedly, 30-year-old Saipov used a rental truck at Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway road in South Manhattan; in this October attack, he drove all passersby and bikers first.
In order to reason the death sentence, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov killed those eight people "whatever" and seriously injured several "whatever" people, according to the death penalty's intentional notice filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible in both cases to impose the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 cases, including eight counts of murder for organized crime, which is commonly used by the federal prosecution in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction by motor vehicles.
The prosecutor said the attack should have been "planned and planned beforehand", as Saipov had "acted cruelly"; he described it as such.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov's actions caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the intentional notice.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been over a decade since the Southern District of New York sued a death penalty case.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was then charged with the murder of two drug providers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time capital punishment was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were charged with conspiracy to commit to spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbek Saipov showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
The police said that he did not feel bad about what he had done to the investigators.
According to the prosecution, Saipov told the authorities that he had seen videos of the ISIS in his mobile inspiration for the attack.
He also requested, in the words of the police, that the flag of the ISIS be placed on the hospital room.
In regards to 22 felony charges, he has declared that he is innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders responsible for replacing Saipov, said they have taken a "great disappointment" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek capital punishment instead of accepting a guilty plea for life imprisonment without possibility of release will only extend trauma to people who have suffered the impact of these events," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to apply for a death sentence.
A member of the Conservative Party says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of negotiations around Brexit
Nigel Farage has promised to "mobilize the people's army" today in protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The UKIP party's former leader has said that politicians need to "feel warm" to eurosceptics, and Theresa May's parliamentarians have suggested that to take care of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Parliamentarian Peter Bone has explained to participants at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would have been "outside" if Mr Farage was already Brexit's secretary.
But the Conservatives to stay have organised a protest against Brexit in the city, and highlight the challenge faced by Mrs May: reconciling the completely divided queues.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Chequers commitment plan going, but in the meantime he is supporting Brexit supporters, remaining supporters and the EU attacks.
The Allies believe that it will move forward and try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of such reactions, and force Eurosceptics and labourers to decide between its offer or the "cause".
Mr. Bone explained to the participants of the Leave Means Leave that it was done in Solihull, he wants to "exhibit the Chequers".
He also stated that Mr Farage should be allowed to cooperate and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Wellingborough Party's parliamentarian added, "I will defend Brexit, but we have to fire Chequers."
In expressing opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected the public opinion change since the 2016 vote: "The fact that British people have changed their mind and want to stay is a lie."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, also attended the march, and explained to the correspondents: "I'm just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers are not popular, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not popular with our party members, nor among our activists who rock the streets and make it possible for us to win the election.
Let go of the Chequers and begin to listen."
Addressing Mrs May, he added, "The Prime Ministers must keep their word to continue their work.
Mr Farage told those involved in the march that politicians should be forced to "feel warm" if they are going to betray his decision in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that 'we won't let them get away with it'.
Addressing the enthusiastic public, he added: "I want you to feel warm to our political class about betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the army of citizens who gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud of it."
Meanwhile, supporters of their stay marched through Birmingham before a two-hour demonstration in the centre of the city.
A few activists raised anti-Brexit posters after this weekend's group lunch.
Lt. Adonis, who has a fellow laborer, ridiculed the conservatives for their security concerns with the party's application at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that ICT systems can get to work properly, and in Ireland Canada added the whole plus chain technology, of limitless friction, of free trade without limit."
"It's a big lie.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren will "carefully" consider the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully" consider the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper has reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke of his future at a plenary meeting held on Saturday at the city hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who is often criticized by President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the state representative of the Republican Party; Diehl was the vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He is said to be able to take Trump's place in 2020.
The event, which took place in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, was the 36th meeting since Trump took office with his colleagues in the form of a plenary session at City Hall.
One participant asked him if he intended to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for "women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and for that to happen, a woman must be in charge."
A suspect has been arrested for the shooting that resulted in the death of Sims at Louisiana State University.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect on Friday for the shooting that resulted in the death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported at the news conference at 11:00 a.m. (eastern time) that the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was imminent.
He had previously opened the video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in it.
Sims, a 20-year-old man, was shot and killed Friday morning near the southern university campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a bullet wound to the head, and as a result, he eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul explained to the Saturday newspaper via the 247sports network.
Wayde got involved in a conflict trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and admitted he had been present, held a gun in his hand, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to prison at the Police Department in the parish of Baton Rouge in the east.
Sims grew up in the nearly two-foot-tall Baton Rouge, played 32 10-star games last season, and averaged 17.4 plays per minute, averaging 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix race: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after beating Sebastian Vettel by team orders
It became clear on Saturday that since Valtteri Bottas had been ranked ahead of Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes team's orders would be short-lived in the race.
From the start, Bottas performed beautifully, and nearly knocked out Hamilton in the first two rounds of defending his place, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the boxes first, and Hamilton had to get into the traffic at the end of the peloton, which should have had a direct effect on the race.
The Mercedes entered the boxes one turn later, and came out behind Vettel, but after a run Hamilton got ahead; in fact, in the competition, the Ferrari's driver was free to keep his position after making a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started the race in the last row of the exit ramp and finished the first round in seventh place.
Next, he remained in first place for a large part of the race, and to the end, he held off the tires to finish the race quickly and to advance to Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually entered the box-office at the 44th round, but was unable to live up to his pace in the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day; Valtteri's been doing a great job all weekend, and it's been really honest.
The team did a great job in the competition," said Hamilton.
Those were inappropriate gestures.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein during a march held on Saturday to show that she had not leaked the letter of Christine Blasey Ford that accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When he spoke at a demonstration held in West Virginia, the president made no direct reference to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what is happening in the Senate shows people to be "evil, false, and untrue."
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate in the last few days, is that you see anger, you see people who are angry, you see people who are evil, they're fake and they're lying," he said.
"That you see the publications and the leaks and say 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked the letter?
Do you remember his reply? Have you leaked the letter? "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we didn't leak the letter," he added, mimicking the senator's reaction.
A letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford in July, and leaked last September, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in his office.
"I have not concealed any of Dr. Ford's allegations; I have not leaked his story," Feinstein told the board, The Hill newspaper reported.
"He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it secret, as he had asked."
But the fact that he refused it was not welcome in the President's side, who stated during the march held on Saturday night, "I'll tell you what: those were inappropriate gestures.
It may not have been him, but they were the most unwelcome gestures I have ever seen."
Following the defense of the Supreme Court candidate who has been accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by three women, the President stated that the Democrats are using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are willing to do anything to restore power.
They're evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control," said the president, Mediaite site reported.
Elite league: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars regained their elite league match on Friday, losing to the Belfast Giants, who won 5-3 in Dundee's second choice match.
He started the Giants win with two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were drawn, but the Giants quickly regained the lead.
Francis Bouchard brought Dundee back into the draw, and eventually Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured him the victory.
It was the third league defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who lost 2-1 in Belfast against Dundee.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for both teams, and the Giants had won their previous three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute, 3:35 into the minute, assisted by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier, who doubled the marker.
It was a lively start, for Sullivan brought the draw back at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie and he scored in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer tried to make sure the Giants reached the first break with the marker on his side, and at the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the homers reorganised and Bouchard brought the draw back with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen and give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match, and at the end of the second half, they brought the team a fifth goal and, with it, a victory.
The Giants players, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air controller is killed when hundreds of passengers on an airplane escape from an earthquake.
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after being assured that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off properly and die.
More than 800 people have been killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake rocked the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Numerous strong replications have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues left to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and leave the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
In turn, he remained there to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321 properly took off, which was on track at the time.
Next, he jumped from the control tower when he saw that he was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News site has reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take us to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear that," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll will rise to thousands, and the Indonesian table of disaster management says that access to the villages of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the rate will still grow, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and we were unable to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the board's spokesman.
A maximum of six metres of waves have completely destroyed Palu; a massive burial will be held there on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, explained to the Sky News site: "Every minute, an ambulance full of bodies arrives.
Clean water is scarce.
People are stealing all the food in the small markets."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as quickly as possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia, arrived in Palura on Sunday, and explained to the country's military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia has also been rocked by another earthquake this year, which occurred in the city of Lombok, and more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after the plane crash that took place in a lake
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a Pacific lake in Micronesia now reports one man missing after being told that 47 passengers and crew had successfully evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a release that he could not make sure a male passenger was missing until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to reporters who asked for more details about the passenger (such as age or nationality).
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and crew were able to be rescued after the plane fell into the water while on its way to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officers said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Army said the plane crashed into the lake next to the track.
Some witnesses speculated that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's a really good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could easily reach the emergency air of the sinking plane by advancing in the water that held them to their waists.
He said that the saffrons were frightened and rioting, and that he suffered a minor wound to the head.
The U.S. Army said that the assistance of fishermen working around the pier was also very helpful in rescue operations, for which a puncture vessel was used to bring passengers to the ground before the plane sank 30 feet (100 feet) in the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none have been due to Air Niugini.
Analysts complete chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor delayed the case in the recent trial of a man who is accused of having burned a woman in Mississippi alive on Saturday 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of mental analysis.
He revealed to the jury that he used mobile phone records to link the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night the woman died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that show that she was with Tellis Chambers at night when she died, thus contradicting Tellis' previous assertion, according to The Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers's just as Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "talking lies" because "the truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when he died.
According to mobile phone records, however, they had only known each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from the phone.
"He erased it from life," Hale said.
The defenses will begin on Sunday with the final allotments.
The judge said that the trial will take place later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop awareness?
A trio of hip-hop performers want to challenge people who have a negative opinion about the type of music, and by doing so, they will fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed in Bristol says hip-hop music has abandoned its early political messages and the struggle for social issues.
They want to go back to his roots, and get the conscious hip-hop to be known again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have seen the revival of such hip-hop in recent times in the United Kingdom, through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York babysitter accuses a couple of of of evicting him after a "racial" message
A New York babysitter has accused a couple of people of discriminating against him and dismissing him because of a mistake it was not for him and after receiving a message from his mother that he was "another black man".
The pair have denied that he is a racist, stating that the accusation is "too much".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was surprised to learn that the new employee who would take care of the children, Giselle Maurice, was black when Maurice arrived home on his first workday in 2016.
"THE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, ANOTHER BETTER," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice
According to the New York Post, when she noticed the mistake, she said she felt "desperate" in Plasco-Flaxman and fired Miss Maurice, the previous babysitter, who was African-American, saying that she had not been a good worker and that she was expecting a Filipino babysitter instead.
He paid Miss Maurice that single workday, and asked for an Uber to take him home.
Now Maurice has sued the couple, and has asked for compensation for the damages caused by the dismissal, including $350 for six months of the day, for although he had no contract, he was initially hired to live in the house for six months and take care of it.
"I want to show them that this sort of thing is not done," he explained to the Post newspaper on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied that he is a racist, and have said that dismissing Maurice was reasonable and necessary because he feared they could not trust him after insulting him.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He's not a racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco explained to the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person you have insulted, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
No way."
In explaining that the charge was "so far from over", Plasco said that his wife had had the child for less than two months and was "in a difficult position".
"Will you be looking for someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," the investment banker added.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the public opinion tribunal has quickly sued the couple on social networks, punishing them for their attitudes and logic.
They feared that Paddington's publisher would not like a bear that speaks to its readers, a new letter has shown.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: "It's hard to put it in the place of someone who first read it before the book's publication.
It's a lot of fun knowing what we know about Paddington's big success now."
Dad was a cameraman for the BBC network before he was inspired to write a children's book by a small toy bear; his daughter said his father had an optimistic attitude about people rejecting his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "gairy taste", as he died last year.
As for Paddington, he says he was "an important member of the family", and that his father was proud of his success in the end.
"He was a silent man, and he wasn't vain," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to her that he almost made her feel as if she were some child who gets something: you're proud of her, even though it's not really your achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success more or less.
Although it was the creation of her and her imagination, she always acknowledged the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello on the phone.
As soon as they landed, their daughter was immediately taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, but doctors were unable to do anything to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was very serious, that he did not think he would go out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling him that he was going to die in the next couple of minutes and that I had to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating were gradually exhausting and leaving his system.
He died a little sooner than I thought, and it was over.
All I could do was sit and wait, knowing it would all start there.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold him."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had since been afflicted by the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting the grief she felt.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"My head was bowed, and my tears came down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Some distressed women have posted signs on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide
Two women who have lost their lives because of suicide want more people to avoid taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have placed signs on a bridge in Wales that contain optimistic messages and phone numbers so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began having depression problems, and killed herself when she was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day," he said.
Mrs. Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son had a special gift for cooking, and had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile shone anywhere."
However, he quit his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly worried there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created posters so that people "know there are people who can tell you and help you, even though you are a friend.
Do not remain silent; you must speak."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she too was her partner for 15 years shortly after the death of her mother who lost Mark.
"He didn't say he was sad, he didn't say he was depressed," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his attitude.
He was heartbroken on Christmas Day; when the children opened their presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death was a major trauma for them, but they must move on: "It leaves a void in the family.
It knocks us down.
But we all have to keep going, and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is shaken after FBI investigation begins
"I thought: if we could get something like what he asked for, such as a limited time or a limited district investigation, maybe we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, and added that he feared the Committee was "split" in the face of the turmoil caused by enthusiastic supporters.
Why didn't the FBI want Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican followers to investigate the case?
The opposite opinion is due to time.
There are only five weeks left for the midterm elections: they will be on November 6th.In them, republicans are expected to get bad results, and if so, they will start a race to get the man they want elected to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has made numerous phone calls to senators, and put pressure on them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, for Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and it was through him that he met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI makes its report?
Voting will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if he did, Vice President Mike Pence could break the draw and present it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of fugitives has dropped since Kim is in power
The number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korean Uniting Department, said that there had been 1,127 refugees in the previous year compared to the 2,706 refugees who had been in 2011.
Mr Park said the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher fines on human traffickers has had a significant impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Almost all North Korean refugees are granted South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans with strong protection measures.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war in themselves, two of them have significantly improved relations between them in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the ongoing denuclearization negotiations.
Earlier in June, a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un took place in Singapore, where they agreed to the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Minister of External Affairs Ri Yong-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the US of making no progress since then.
"If we don't have confidence in the U.S., we won't have confidence in our national security, and as such, we won't give up our weapons first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly that was held in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has told Brett Kavanaugh that she is "hysterical" and not ready to stand down at the Supreme Court.
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi has told Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh that she is "hysterical" and that she is not ready to stand on the Supreme Court as far as genius is concerned.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever done so, they would have said it was 'hysterical'," Pelosi said; this was his reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and at times he almost screamed and mumbled when talking about his family and youth.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, and said that the allegations against him are an "organized and offensive split" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he cannot stand on the Supreme Court because it has shown that he has an impartial opinion against the Democrats.
"With these assertions and his stance against the Clintons and Democrats, he's been out of the league," he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if Kavanaugh would be elected and if the Democrats gained a majority in the Chamber of Representatives if he would contest it.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not ready to be on either the Supreme Court or the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about the judgements Kavanaugh will make against the law for accessible health care, or Roe v. Wade, which applies conservative justice.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions when he was asked if he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"A hysterical, impartial person can't go to court and expect us to take it well," Pelosi said.
And women need to be ordained.
It's a fair speech; a terrible rage for months and years, and he can't let go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's strange, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who was a local executive helped me tremendously, and told me that she also did it when she got upset, but she had developed a technique: when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person who was talking to her: 'I'm crying, you can think I'm sad.
But I'm angry."
And then, he kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Tears are not badly seen to express anger, partly because they are misrepresented.
I remember clearly something that happened to me in one of my first jobs, it was in an office where most of them were men, where I was crying in anger once, and a more mature woman grabbed me by the neck, from the beginning I was a bit afraid of the cold boss, he took me to the head of the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understand you."
Patricia Schroeder was then a Democrat member of the Colorado congress, and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a ship called Monkey Business and it was discovered that he had a love affair with a woman other than his wife and refused to race, Miss Schroeder, frustrated, decided to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he said laughing at me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last one they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "White Edward and the seven gnomes."
As the campaign began a long time ago, he was running around collecting money, so he decided he wouldn't enter the race until he collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He noted that some of the followers who gave the men $1,000 had only given them $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not be making an official campaign, he was deeply moved: his gratitude for the people he supported, his frustration with the system that made it so difficult for him to collect money and voters instead of representatives, and his anger at sexist attitudes.
"You must have thought I was very nervous," Miss Schroeder explained of her reaction to the press seeing her attitude.
"You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
The benefits that commercial war between the U.S. and China could bring to Beijing
The salvations that determined the beginning of the commercial war between the U.S. and China were humbling, and even if the conflict is short-lived, the crack between the countries may have benefited Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning early in the year, at which time China imposed a tax on the main products it exported, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase came this week, as new tariffs that will affect products valued at $200 billion (150 billion pesos) would apply to half the goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has applied reparations on the subject at every turn, and the latest was a rise in tariffs from five to ten per cent to American goods valued at $60 billion.
China has said that it will equalize every US increase, and the second strongest economy in the world will not change its mind so easily.
Asking Washington to back down would lead to impeachment, but publicly surrendering to the U.S. would be more embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing did well, the pressures for US commercial war could benefit China in the long run, as they would undermine dependence on both economies.
"Washington's or Beijing's politicians making a quick decision would create conditions for economic stagnation in any of the two countries.That's more dangerous than what observers first thought," said researcher Abigail Grace, who researches Asia at the new U.S. Security Center along with many other experts.
Syria is 'prepared' to return refugees, External Affairs Minister says
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees who wish to voluntarily return, and it is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by the prolonged war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the local situation is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the process against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that they can return to normalcy as soon as possible.
Now, the situation is suitable for refugees who wish to voluntarily return to the country they had to leave due to economic measures that made terrorism and their daily lives and maintenance difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government will be very grateful for the help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he noted that he will not accept help from the conditional or from the countries that supported the rebellions.
Europe picks up Ryder Cup cup victory held in Paris
With a final score of 16.5 points after beating the U.S. team with 10.5 points, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at the outdoor Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six times in a row on European soil, and has not won any Ryder Cups in Europe since 1993.
Europe once again carried the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The star Phil Mickelson of the United States had been through almost the entire tournament, and had thrown the exit punch into the water on the 16th hole of the 3rd half, thus passing the witness to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Milinari excelled in all rounds, and became one of four players who had ever achieved 5, 0 and 0 results since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth scored 5 and 4 and was outscored by the worst European team player, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World's best player Dustin Johnson scored 2 and 1 against the reigning Ian Poulter, and reached the Ryder Cup final.
The Spaniard Sergio García, who took part in eight Ryder Cups, became the championship's top European winner with 25.5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a tough year.
So she thanks Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to get my cup back.
This is teamwork, and I'm glad I was able to help," García said, excited after Europe's victory.
He has passed on the testimony to the Spaniard John Ram, who defeated the American myth Tiger Woods (2 and 1) in the one-on-one game on Sunday.
"I'm very proud to have beaten Tiger Woods; I grew up watching that man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France, and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 results in the Ryder Cup cup.
Strange statistics for one of the best players ever to have won 14 major titles over only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend looking for a solution to this situation, except for players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, captain of the United States, said of the team's bad play, "I'm proud of my boys; they tried.
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a while.
It didn't work out.
Happy Birthday to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have played very well.
We'll meet again, I'll work with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll move on.
I love my 12 boys, and I'm very proud to be their captain.
We have to accept failure.
We stayed out."
