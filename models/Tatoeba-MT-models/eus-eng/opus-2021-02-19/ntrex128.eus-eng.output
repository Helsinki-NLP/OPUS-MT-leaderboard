The members of the House of Wales have expressed their own concern that they will consider them "sullengers."
Some members of the meeting have been disappointed after they have heard the suggestion of changing the name of their office as MWP (the Member of the World Laws).
This idea has been created after we have developed plans to change the name of the United States of Wales.
The members of the political assembly are worried because this plan is a good way to make fun of them.
A member of the laboist party on the board said, "Helesz, Twp, and Pwp, that new name rhymes with the words "in English."
If you're out of Wales, in Wales, the twp means "nozo" and pwp means "kak."
In his turn, a member of the Scotland Council said that the whole party was not very happy, and suggested the name replacement.
Also, a member of the Conservative Part of Wales has said that the name "open" is changed to new ideas, but his anxiety has also expressed the rhymes that may cause MWP changes.
In order to make this conflict more fully understood, we must consider that the letters w of Wales and the English letters of Yorkshire have the same tone.
On the other hand, the commission of the assembly, which is making a legal draft of names, says, "As to the members of the Union, they will have the sole care to choose the descriptives they would use."
According to the 2017th act of the Wales government, the Wales assembly has the power to change its name.
In June, he published the results of a public inquiry to choose the proposed proposals, and in general the name of the Law of Wales received many expressions of peace.
As for the names of the members of the assembly, he chose the name of the Congressmen of the Law of Wales or of the WMP (in English sigletan), but the chosen name MWP was decided on a public inquiry.
The members of the meeting suggest alternate options, but it is extremely difficult to choose with one mouth, especially for Presidents of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who has been obliged to send a sketch for the changes in a few weeks.
However, the legislation of any changes to be made will affect the way the meeting works, while others will cause the members of the Assembly to lose a good name which will cause them to lose their rules and the design of the meeting will be handled with the help of this law.
When they dispute about the change of legislation, the members of the Assembly will have occasion to decide their names.
The Macedonians will participate in a Reedemendum to change the name of the country
The voters will vote on Sunday and decide whether to change the name of the country as "The Republic of North Macedonia."
The long account of the last decades of Greece (which has a province called Macedonia) has been arranged for the purpose of repairing the length of the country.
The Athenian government has long remarked that the name of the neighbor of the North is a revolt of his country, and has prevented the demand to enter the Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who is the rival of the Plebiscite to change his name, said that he would not see the voter.
However, the followers of the Refrendum say that the first Minister, including Zev in Zoran, is only a price to be paid to access EBan and NATOn.
The bells of St. Martin's church lose their voices for the affairs of the churches in Harlem
"I've spoken to so many elderly people, and they say you might find a bar and a church in every corner a long time," says Mr. Adams.
But today there is nothing."
He says the disappearance of the bars is normal.
"People use other methods to socialize," he explains.
"The barans are no longer the neighbouring drawing-rooms used to unite."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained for the sales of the assets will not be enough, and we shall be again at the beginning first or later."
The churches may also be replaced with houses, and the temples of the neighbourhood will be built by community full of people who do not care about them.
"People who are going to buy their property will be white people," says the Church, "and that's why they're going to shut up because that new people aren't members of the congregation's congregation."
The White People's congregation built these two churches before Harlem had been a black metropolis, which was the Metropolity of 1870 and built a decade later.
In 1930, he went from the neighborhood to the original Methodist congregation.
After that, a congregation of black people took the pension.
Reverendo John Howard Johnson's black congregation took St. Martin's church, Howard organized a bocot against all the stores in the 125 commercial street in Harlem, who didn't hire black people or climb them up.
By a fire in 1939, the church had suffered a great deal of damage, but Father Johnson's churches designed various plans to re-establish the church, and they made a charge of re-establishing carbon.
Reverendo David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to San Martin, named the Cardinal 'the bells of the Poor People'.
The expert who played the bell on July gave him another name, "The treasure of Culture" and "instrutable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also declared that it was the first Karilloy hit by a black musician in the whole world; the musician, Dionisio A. Lindek, went 18 years ago to play the larger Karilloi of the Church of Riverside.
Mr. Merriweather shows that San Martin has not replaced his musician.
In the past few months St. Martin has seen a number of laborious expeditions of architects and contractors, some of which have been brought by laity leaders or bishops.
On the other hand, the Council of Parrocaia (a piece of artery composed of lalicists), on the other hand, sent a letter to the dithyre in July to check that the contrasts of these persons "shall "dispensions to the parish," because the parish has nothing to do with the opposition of architects and contractors sent by the Dionysis.
Some of the churches have expressed their complaints for the unfathomable transparency of Diosesia.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while he was looking for oysters on the coast of California.
The police say that on Saturday a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and wounded him while he was looking for oysters on the coast of California on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack had been on the Encinital Sea before 7 p.m.
According to Chad Hammel's KSWB-TV channel in San Diego, he was swimming with his friends on Saturday morning for half an hour, but his friend heard him screaming and asking for help, and then swam with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel thought he was alive with joy that he had found an oyster, but then he realized that his friend was shouting, "I've been hurt!"
They bit me!
'I could see his whole chalk,' said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
'I cried out to everyone to get out of the water, 'There's a shark!' cried Hammel.
San Diego Rady was taken to the hospital and his situation is serious.
You can't make out the species of the shark that attacked it.
Captain Larry Giles, a member of Sorosle, introduced a report in front of the media and said they've seen a shark a few weeks before, but it was decided that the species wasn't dangerous.
Gilles also declared that the wounds of the victim are at the top of the body.
The police have closed access from the Sea of Casblade to the Swami beach of Encinitase to support the safety of the people for 48 hours of research.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket's plans go into the United Kingdom Cosmetic Market
The supermarket Sainsbury's has taken over all the shops of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, and now offers a series of beauty-like shops with a number of expert and specialized workers.
While the sales of fashion and domestic produce are diminishing, 2.8 billion francs have been invested in the sector of the beauty of the United Kingdom which is growing indefinitely; larger series of beauty will be built and will be tested at 11 dens of the country.
With investments in beauty, televisions, microwaves, and domestic products can be taken advantage of by supermarkets.
According to the Sainsbury's supermarkets, it will double the offer of their beauty and offer more than 3000 products, and also Revlon, Essie, Tweezer, and Dr. PawPaw and similar marks in the customer's jurisdiction.
As far as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are concerned, they'll have more room in the marked areas, like fields that can be found in the Bots dens.
Besides, the supermarket re-appears the make-up of his "Boutique" brand, which is a perfect product, and the younger buyers demand such products more and more.
Besides, Frangrance Shop will try the gifts given by the perfumer in the two shops of the Sainsbury's supermarket; the first opened at Croydon, south of London, and the second, in Selly Oak, will open at the end of the year.
It's the reason that on the ordinary purchases and the small shops of the place are apt to buy nutrients, the supermarkets have to work their heads and ears to attract customers.
Mike Coup, the head director of the Sainsbury's supermarkets, said that the salespoints will take the style of large stalls and that the supermarket will reduce the threat of the champions at the time and of the Lidl with no more product than service and food.
Sainsbury's supermarket has opened the Argos sale points in hundreds of shops, and has opened several Habitats, after having bought these two chains two years ago, for this reason the sale of food has been strengthened, and the chains bought are more useful than ever.
The supermarket tried to re-open the series of beauty and medicines, but the strategy failed.
Then he joined the Sainsbury's Boots at the beginning of 2000, but this association ended because the process of breaking profits in the supermarket's departments had become burned paper.
A new strategy was arranged when Sainsbury's supermarket sold his 281 shops of medicine to Celesium, who owns the chain of Lloyds Phamancy, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
Lloyds string will have a function set in the planned plan: it will add a large set of fancy brands to watch the cover on all fours, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The commercial director of the Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Supermercades said, "We've improved the aspect of our departments so that our clients can find perfect environments.
We also hired experienced workers to give detailed advice about the products.
We have designed our collection of brands to satisfy all demands, and, thanks to comfortable surroundings and places, our beautiful areas offer a modern and easy choice in front of all those who use obsolete methods."
Peter Jones is "surved" after Holly Willoughby has canceled the offer of 11 million francs
The star of Dragons Den went to Peter Jones 'surresed' because he wants to pay full attention to the new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV Enpres after the TV reader had abandoned the 11 million francs associated with the usual branding business.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the family product and the quarter Truly that sells the components.
The marriage business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The host of the Thys Morning program, 37, used Instagram to present his resignation.
As a result of Holly Willoughby's resignation, to accept the contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV companies, the star of Dragons' program, Peter Jones was terribly annoyed at the last moment to leave the big profit business between them.
According to our sources, on Tuesday, there was a curious meeting at the main Marlowe sedan and, by consequence, Jones was "surious" when he heard the explanation of the most famous woman on our television, that he would accept new contracts of $1.5 million francs, so he couldn't spend any more time on the products and components of the Truly brand.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Willoughby's 11 million francs property.
Willoughby, after saying 37 in Instagram that he left Truly's shop to go out of the United Kingdom to a vacation house.
A source said, "It's always been between Holly's priorities.
This decision will ensure the future of the next two decades.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us with our mouths full of teeth.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, just when he was about to close the mark offer.
In fact, Marlowe's store is full of products to sell."
According to the experts, the company is about to lose millions of francs because of the entrance to the introduction of the This Morning program (which is the most profitable introduction to the United Kingdom); the company has invested a great deal of money in many products (and the rest of it will have to face the remains of the cushions, candles, clothes, and domestic products) and the delays that can now arise.
Besides, this conflict may be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin have three children and Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, have been close friends for ten years.
Willoughby and Caputo created a Truly brand in 2016 and Jones, 52, entered March as director.
Both couples always organize their vacations together and 40 per cent of Baldwin's television set Jones.
Willoughby is an ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as an introduction to I'm A Ceelebrity of the ITV channel.
One of Jones's sources announced last night that he wouldn't say anything about his business activities.
A rough conversation, but then "we fell in love."
He was joking about the wrong words he was supposed to suffer because of the media, the fact that everything was "superable" comment about the North Korea leader.
Why did President Trump give so many things?
Trump used his voice "telecular" to reply:
"I didn't give anything."
After having made a first meeting with Singapore in June, President Trump said that Kim wants to arrange a second meeting and, thanks to this, a very important step has been made on the way to the nuclear disarming of North Korea.
However, the process of nuclear disarming has stopped.
After three months in June, the major diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said to the leaders of the world of the United States, in the general assembly of the United States, North Korea has not seen "good response" in the direction of the United States, as regards the steps of nuclear unarmation.
Instead, the punishments inflicted by the United States have been hardened to maintain the pressure of the country.
Trumpe has a more positive view, and has expressed it in his last speech.
'Our relations with Korea are better than ever,' he said.
"In addition, we were going to declare war with North Korea."
That war could kill millions of people.
But now we have this extraordinary relation between our hands."
Besides, he said that the effort to improve his relations with Kim has been successful; among others, the tests made with missiles have ended, the pawn-daughters have been improved, and the delay of the rest of the U.S. military has been completed.
It also explains its unusual point of view with regard to its conversations with Kim.
"It's extremely easy to do with the president, but instead of having 10,000 people who want to get into the country, we've got 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the personals he had collected there.
Indonesia tsunamis and earthquakes destroyed an island and killed hundreds of thousands.
After Lombo's earthquake, for example, the help of unintelligent institutions to win internationally was not necessary.
Although the 10 percent of the population of Lombok were dispersed, the earthquake was not declared as a national disaster (it is a precondition for the assistance of the nations).
"In many cases, unfortunately, the government clearly said he didn't need international support, so this is a challenge," says Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Child's organization is forming a group going to Palura, but the volunteers still don't know whether they can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, representative of the national disaster agency, according to what has been said, the Indonesian officers are working on Palun so that they can accept the support of international agents.
Despite the earthquakes of Indonesia, the country has subdivided measures to resist the rage of nature.
The forts against the tsunamis have been built at Aceh, but there are still too few forts on the coast.
Palu has no sirens to warn people, and even though the warning is on, perhaps so many deaths.
When the weather's fine, travel between the Indonesia Islands may be a challenge.
Even more, natural disasters make them difficult to question logistics.
A hospital seaship was anchored at Lomboken to give treatment to the victims of the earthquake, and now goes to Pallura, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the disaster.
President Widodo's campaign was based on Projects to improve the Indonesia substructure and invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funds have been reduced, and the administration of the President of the Game is in distress while the next year's election is prepared.
In like manner, Mr. Game is in trouble to control the tensions of the sects in Indosion; for example, most members of the Islamic party have taken a more consistent view of religion.
Thus more than 1000 people have died, and tens of thousands have lost their homes because the standards of Christians and Islamians have taken their battles into the streets, while the rest use of machetes, bows, arrows, and similar weapons.

The state of Parliament Cromwell becomes the final goal of rewrite history.
If it goes away, it will be poetic justice-as the Taliban destroyed so many religious objects, so did the Puritan fanatics of England with so many historical and cultureal objects in the country.
The Cromwell society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a "noble" and that he's trying to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, representative of the Cromwell Society, said, "It is an inevitable discussion of the removal of the States of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace; it has become an objective Cromwell.
Cromwell himself has never asked or organized the iconclecticisms of the civil wars in England.
Maybe we should sacrifice another Cromwell for his ancestors, Thomas, for the actions that he had done in the previous century.
The impressive representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's Cromwell, is part of the opinion of the century and of our historical theory, and so many people still believe that the actions of that person should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph, "There are fewer people in the 19th century who believe that Cromwell was still a defender of the parliament against external pressures, in which case, of course, we are speaking of monarchy.
The essence of historical discussions will remain whether it is the exact representation of the person.
However, we can safely say that the battle between the 17th century has been the starting point of our country's development, and the famous Cromwell was part of the parties who participated in this starting-point.
Even if he had the title "Lord Proteus" to celebrate and remember all the achievements he won.
A pig kills by a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market on the southwest of China according to local media.
The man with the name "Yuan" was found dead, his body had a cut artery, and he was bleeding in a pork shop of the Liupanshui market in the province of Guihou, according to what the South China Morning Post specified on Sunday.
On May 30th, 2005, the pig's sister-in-law is prepared to insert pigs in Xiningen of China's province of Quinghai.
Usually, on Wednesdays, he travels from the province of Yunnan with his cousin in the market where he sells 15 pigs.
The next morning his cousin found the body of the dead man and saw that the door of the pork shop was open.
He also declared that there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
The court report confirmed that it was a 550-franc pig that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were full of blood and bleeding." He explained Guiyang Evening News, whose name is "Wu."
According to the recordings of the security camera, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 in the morning to feed pigs.
They found his body in an hour later.
The animal who killed the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin's cot.
The pig is locked up to avoid further attacks and let the police collect evidence.
Yuan's family and market leaders are negotiated for his death.
Although strange, some pigs' attacks have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and the man received serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig of 650 francs surrounded a farmer from Wales in his tractor until the man's wife drove away the animal.
In 2012, the pigs of a farmer from Oregon ate his body, and after that, a peasant from Manitob in the CBC News wouldn't know that pigs are aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, it can work as a "man."
"They love Jolast.
They're like kids and they're very curious. They don't want to hurt you.
You just need to show respect," he said.
The little storms of Rosa hurricane will leave a cloud of rain on the south-west side of the United States.
According to the weather, Rosa is weakening as she goes to the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, next few days, Ross will bring rain showers to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m., Rosa will create wind 85 miles an hour, and she'll be turned into the waters of category 1. According to the Eastern hour, on Sunday, the end of the south-west of Mexico was found thirty-five miles away from Eugenia.
That's how you expect them to go north of Rosa on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-presion point is rising from the Pacific and heading east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa is going to the mainland of California, a tropical storm, and will take a tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
Besides, Monday Rose will bring 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical moisture will be combined with the point at the bottom, and there will be great drops of rain in the days of the south-west.
In local places, there may be 1-4 inches of dangerous water in the desert because sudden floods, streams of ruins, and earthquakes can be produced.
The rainy rains produced by great tropical moisture can leave 2 to 3 inches in exact places, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It's expected to collect 2-4 inches of water on the southwest, especially Arizona.
As tropical rains are wandering, they can produce sudden floods and conditions of revolt.
It's not at all recommended that we go for a walk in the desert if a tropical storm has been warned.
Rainflakes can make rocks into violent streams, and storms can bring wind and dust.
Besides, the pressure will come down, there will be rain showers of the area on the southern coasts of California.
Due to the rain, you can pick up half-inch water, and perhaps you can create small streams of ruins and slippery roads.
This could be the first rainy season of the region.
Also, on Sundays and Mondays, there may be scattered tropical rains in Arizona, but there will be more rains on Monday and Tuesday.
Tuesday, the rainy season will go to four corners, and they will fade until Wednesday.
October may have severe changes of temperature in the United States, as the arctic territory cools, but the temperatures of the Tropics will remain temperate.
Sometimes these temperatures are greatly altered in short distances.
As an example, on Sunday there will be great changes of temperature in the middle of the United States.
There's almost 20 degrees difference between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
The next few days the warmth of summer will come and spread itself everywhere.
The central parts of the United States and the eastern parts of the east will be temperate, and the temperatures of 80 degrees will be north-easted from the southern fields.
On Tuesday, there can be 80 degrees in New York, which are about 10 degrees above average temperatures.
According to the weather conditions of the long term, the Eastern part of the United States will undergo more temperatures than average during the first fortnight of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the declaration of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people saw on Tuesday's sixth channel news about the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford's impressive statements, which, because of the sexual abuses he had been through in 1980, accused Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, the political conflict went on, and the readers of the canals interrupted the permanent programming of Friday to give us a last minute-the Senator of Arizona agreed to make a week's investigation with the FBI.
As Ford said to the Senate magistrate, it is quite certain that Kavanaugh had touched him over and over while he was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
In spite of Kavanaugh, he said in a passionate declaration that he was quite sure he had not.
According to Nielsen's data, about 20,4 million people washed the statement on Friday.
The company calculated the average of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and the MSNBC viewers.
But this amount was not immediately available to other channels, including PBS, C-SPSAN and Fox Business Network.
Besides, Nielsen is usually in trouble with people who watch television in their offices.
For an example, we can say that the number of audiences can be compared to a football World World or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is highly acceptable to the operators in the canal, and, above all, as he was making the statement that he had had 5,69 million audiences, Nielsen said.
It was the second ABC with 3,26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, the NBC got 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million, and CNNN had 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the declaration, the public interest was preserved.
Flake was the core of Friday's drama.
After reporting that the office of the moderate Republican Party would vote for Kavanaugh, the cameras in CNN and CBS were recorded on the Fridays while he was trying to take an elevator surrounded by a demonstration in the hands of the local authorities.
He saw directly in the CNN channel that his eyes were down while the marchers fought.
'I am here in front of you,' said a woman.
"Do you really think he's telling the truth?"
And he added, "You have an evil power, but many women have nothing."
Before closing the elevator doors at that moment, Flake said that his office had published a report and that it would give more details at the meeting.
The wires and television chains were sending direct visits, while the great magistrate, Kavanaugh, was gesticulating the appointment of being Senator.
However, Flake said he would vote after a week's examination of the arguments against the candidate, and remember that he was asking the Democratic minority Party to do that.
After talking to his friend, Senator Chris Coons the Democrat, Flake almost believed in the investigation.
Having spoken to Coons and several senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, because the Republican party doesn't have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation to examine the arguments against Kavanaugh.

The fight between the police and the Catalonia Independents to vote for independence before the anniversary.
Six people have been arrested on this Saturday at Barcelon, while the marchers of independence joined the thousands of people to the factions of the police during the battle with the riots, to remember the first anniversary of their elections in Catalonia to vote for independence.
He stopped a group of men dressed up in disguise, but they threw eggs and paint dust at them, so that in the streets full of tourists there was a cloud of dust.
There was more fighting to stop the quarrel because the police were using their fights later.
Also, groups in favor of independence had been singing "We won't forget it, we won't forgive it" in front of the Unionists who were singing "Long Life" to Spain.
According to the local journalists, fourteen people received treatment for small injuries received in quarrels.
There's a lot of nervousness in this country that wants to find independence after election on October 1st, which was illegal in the government of Madrid, but they got a day to celebrate the Catalonia Independentists.
Most of the voters voted for independence, but the part of the community was very small because of the number of citizens who wanted to vote for the election.
According to the authorities of Catalonia, they were wounded after the attack of the police, because they had gone to the voters' places for elections to stop them, so there was a violent quarrel.
The teams in favor of independence camped Friday to avoid a demonstration for the national police.
There was a demonstration, but he was forced to take another course.
Narcis The Termes, 68, an electrician, went to the demonstration of independence with his wife, and said that Catalonia has no longer any hope of independence.
"We had a wonderful moment.
My parents wept for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After having won an important but important victory during the last local elections, Catalan parties in favor of independence have had a lot of trouble keeping public interest in this year, and some of the party leaders are either exiled or arrested and are now waiting for their resurvation and their independence.
Joan Puig, the forty-year-old mechanic is filming the march on the police side and the both parties say that they're guilty of this situation.
'There's more tension,' he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junques, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who had been waiting for the trial in prison for the next year, declared that he would take part in the elections for the Parliament of Europe organized for the next year.

Menga's launch thanks to Livingston wins 1-0 in front of the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal has confirmed Livingston's age.
Livingston has impressed the Rangers and Steven Warrd gets his second failure in 18 games as leader of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's decision was that Gary Holten's Hibernian team was climbing up the second part.
The Ward's team is out of profit at this time of Premiership and against the Hearts leader (who's got eight more points) he'll have to play the next Sunday.
Before that game, Rangers will have to play Europe with Rapid Vienne Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Livingston team isn't defeated and there's six games left at this time of time; the coach Holt doesn't know what failure is since he replaced Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston loses many options in front of strong visitors
The group of Holders had to get ahead of the goal before they got in, because it's very fair, and he's got a lot of trouble with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way, but all his efforts were lost in front of the door, and then Alan Lithgood was pushed back to the door after the head of Craig Halkett.
The guests were pleased to let the Rangers play, but they knew that the visitors were bored at any time.
And with that mood, the decisive goal came.
The Rangers gave a free launch and Livingston created an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson were combined to mark Menga, but the latter touched the ball in the middle of the door.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers took possession of it, but it was an insurmountable defense in the house, and Professor Liam Kelly passed the game without difficulty.
This model followed half the second part, but the launch of Alfredo Morelos demanded the full skill of Kelly.
Scott Pittman couldn't mark his goal for the Rangers' Allan McGregor porter and Lithgow avoided the other move in Livingston.
The walks came in over and over in Livingston's area, and the house players pulled them out again and again, and two penalts were ordered, because they defied Glent Midleton and the other for touching the ball with their hand, but they both turned aside.
Livingston's "defendable" match - analyse
BBCsk Atador Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arenn
Livingston's game was perfect and perfect.
They've made extra moves for me, and they've got plenty of good options to climb up the steps.
The style of plays and teams has hardly changed since they got to the first level, but Holt has been an extra coach-he has set the group straight since he arrived.
He had several heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been terrible, he's organized and handled an excellent defense, and he's taken care of Connor Goldson and Joe World for the rest of the game.
But the Rangers had no great inspiration.
They work very well when they're under Warrd's orders, but the coach's standard has been forgotten.
The last move has been too weak, and only once have they defeated the defence of the family, and the Rangers must hurry if they want to get them out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan finds opposite welcomes in the colony.
There were smiling and blue sky on Saturday (the 29th of September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany joined in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan in Germany, and the visit was arranged to repair the relations of the allies of NATO.
They have discussed certain questions, among others the absence of human rights and liberty of the press, and the access of Turkey in the European Union.
Then he went to the colony of Erdogan to open a new giant mosque.
The town has the largest number of Turkish inhabitants outside Turkey.
On account of the security measures established by the police, 25,000 persons were locked up in front of the mosque, but several followers gathered round to see their President.
There were hundreds of protests against the Erdogan (the majority of them were low), their voices were put together to protest against the policy measures of Erdogan and the decision of the German government to welcome the President.
The President's protesters on both sides reflected the disagreements that were raised; some German Turks say it is a hero, and others say it's only a self-contradiction.

Besides, in October last year the rival officers had to go to jail to stop a serious fight, because the prisoners were attacking the staff with the billiard sticks.
The hurricane Rosa has become a threat to the Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City cities with sudden floods (perhaps the landlands might benefit)
It's very strange to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but that's what will happen the next week while Rosa Urana runs out of her strength, and she'll visit the southwest desert, and there's a risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already sent a warning about the sudden floods that can arise on Monday and Friday, and the hurricane will enter the west of Arizona and the south and east of Nevada.
Rosa will go straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but the rains on Monday will announce her arrival.
The Phoenix National Weather Service has written in a low voice, "From 1950, ten tropical cycles created 200 miles from Phoenix have kept the status of a tropical storm or depression.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border."
According to the last predictions of the hurricane national centre, 2-4 inches of water will be gathered, and on the edge of the Mogullon at Arizona there will be at most six inches of water.
With regard to other southern-west areas of the desert (the rocky Middle Mountains and the Grand Arro, among others), there will be gathered 1-2 inches of water, and in isolated places there will be at most four inches.
As for those who expect sudden floods, Rosa's rain may be a blessing for the land's sake.
The floods shouldn't be underestimated, but these rain-flakes can be useful for the land that's taking south-west.
According to the service for controlling the mainland in the United States, the 40 critical land-water percentage of Arizona which is the highest category, the weather.com site declared.
First, the road to the hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja Californa peninduula in Mexico.
The power of the hurricane Rosa will be maintained on Sunday morning, and wind will produce at most 85 miles an hour; the Mexican Punta will be thirty-five miles from Eugenia's south, and it will be at twelve miles an hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, and consequently its power is growing weaker.
That way, he'll come to Mexico as a tropical storm Monday afternoon or night.
Since there are places in Mexico where there can be violent storms, there's a great storm in the flood.
According to the weather.com site, "Euri-zaparrads will leave Baja Caifornia 3-6 inches away from Soora to the southwest, and there may be 10 inches of water in some places."
Then Rosa will pass by the North of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona's frontier on Tuesday hours as a tropical depression, then she will cross Arizona and go south Tuesday night to Utah.
"The great threat of the Rosa or of its storms in Baja California, the north-west west of Sono, and the violent storms which will arise in the United States in the southern desert," said the national centre.
These rains will cause in the deserts a flood and a dangerous torrent of ruins, and earth-blossoms on the mountains.

Trump says Kavanaugh is going to stand up for the democrat's "no sense of anger"
"The votes given for Judge Kavanaugh deny the heartless and furious tactics of the democrat," Trumpe said in the mitin of Wheeling (West Virginia).
Also, Trumpe said that Kavanaugh had to endure the absurd and furious part of the democrat during his naming process.
On Tuesday Kavanaugh witnessed Congress, and absolutely denied Christine Blasey Ford's job, according to her years ago when the teenagers were raped by Kavanaugh.
Ford also testified after he heard his copy.
The president said on Saturday, "The American citizens saw the courage, the intelligence and the quality of Kavanaugh that day."
"The votes for choosing Judge Kavanaugh confirm that he has the best legal intelligence of our time; this judge has spent his life in protecting public services," said the president to the Western Virginia followers.
It was not only about Kavanaugh's nomination, but also about the importance of the Republican Party in these elections.
"There are five weeks left to vote in the most important elections of our lives.
I won't take any part in it, but I'll make a campaign," he said.
That's why I'm here to fight against the best candidates.
Trump also said that the democrat campaign is using strategys to ignore and to make it difficult.
According to what a Republican member of the CNN said, the vote for Kavanaugh will be made in the Senate before Friday.
Hundreds of people have died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of dead is increasing
On Saturday, according to the authorities, at least 384 people have died of an earthquake and tsunami caused by Sulaswes the island of Indonium, and most of them died while the enormous waves destroyed the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but in the evening the waves destroyed the coast of six feet (18 feet), and many people were dragged to death and all that was on the way was destroyed.
The tsunmy was founded by an earthquake in magnitude 7.5.
"The tsunami word that was sent yesterday, but the people were still on the beach and did not run away at once, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugho, in a conversation given to them by the representative of the Indonesian (BNPB) in Jakartan.
"The Tsunami drags cars, logs, and houses, and destroyed all that was in the country," Nygroho says; even furthermore, the tsunami has travelled through the open sea before reaching the sea at the speed of 800 km/h.
"So many people have gone up to the trees to escape from the tsunami and have survived," said the representative.
About 16,700 people have gone to the 24th Centres in Palu.
Some buildings and stores are destroyed, and you can see a wrecked bridge and a mosque surrounded by water in photographs of airtics built by the anti-dial agency.
The plagues of the earthquake continued to shake the coast on Saturday.
The earthquakes were discovered in a land of 2.4 million inhabitants.
According to the report published by the Indonesian technology, and to apply, the power level released by major earthquakes on Friday was 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is in a long and narrow bay, may be related to the size of the tsunami, said the agency.
According to Numgroho's account, it's been a terrible "explored" disaster, a thousand houses, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels have been destroyed.
Some victims' bodies have been found among the ruins of the wrecked buildings, so there's more 540 injured and 29 people have disappeared.
In like manner Numgroho said that the number of the victims and the damage could be increased along the coast of the coast of three hundred miles of Palu, especially a place called Donggala, which is near the epic center.
Donggala's media "they don't work and we don't have any information," Nugroho declared.
According to the Red Cross, there are more than 300,000 inhabitants in this place, and at the moment they are going to the site of the organization's workers and volunteers to offer their support.
'It is already a tragedy, but it may be worse,' he said.
On Saturday the agency received strict criticisms not to give information about the tsunami that destroyed Palu, but according to the officers, the waves came after the warning was transmitted.
You can see a man in a building that's shared in social networks, and "sunnamy coming" is shouting to warn the people in the street.
A few minutes later, the water wall reaches the coast and drags buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the truth of the recording.
As the tsunamis which were earthquakes have created general power-munciatives of electricity, all Pallu's media has been suspended, so it has been difficult for the authorities to organize the powers of rescue.
According to the authorities, the soldiers sent help from Jakar and from other cities into their burdens, but the evacutors still need food and wealth.
The city's airport has been opened again to facilitate the efforts of aid, and it will be shut up for public until October.
President Widodo's going to visit the peace centers of Palu on Sunday.
The Indonesia tsunami leaves over 800 deaths.
It's a tragedy.
The workers of the World Vision Department of Donggala have reached the city of Palu (the workers who are present have built canvas shelters in the courtyard of the organization's office), but they have directly seen the terrible state left to ruin, Mr. Doseba said.
"They said they'd seen a lot of broken houses," he said.
That's really bad.
Despite the disasters of the party, some complained of the sad repairs of the work, of the experienced workers and the advice of the assistants not to go to Palura.
Following the Indonesia law, international finances, supplies, and supplies can only be started after having been classed as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster," says Aublia Arrinik, the spokesman of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
When we say, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open the gates to help them, but it hasn't been classified yet."
The second night that had passed after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who were still missing had not yet lost the hopes of a rare chance of showing their loved ones.
On Saturday they took a little baby out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers brought out a woman stuck under the ruins for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandno, he trained two of the parapentists who had been a member of the Asia games which had disappeared from the state of the Indonesian nation, who ended in this month in Indonesia.
There were others in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi J., who were students.
"As an expert in the national world, I have my emotional cargo," he said.
Gendon Jenn showed in the parapentists' community the next few hours since they reported about the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel, that he had been sending messages to his competitors at the WillsApp, which were at the beach party.
His messages, however, had only one grey arrow, no two blue marks.
"I think that means they didn't send those messages," he added.

Mexico AMLO promised not to use an army against the citizens.
The President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obador, has promised not to use armed force or army against the people, when the country has shed blood on students during the 50th year of a represion.
Lopez Obador, on Saturday, swore that he would never use his army in Tlatelol Square to repress the Mexican population.
On October 2, 1968, the army shot against a peaceful scene in the square, and killed 300 people, to stop the rising of the left-handed students who were taking their strength through all the Latin America.
Lappez Obadore has promised to help the Mexicans learn, to open more free public colleges with their monthly pensions.

America should double AI funding
As China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount used to investigate that area, says Kai-Fu Lee investor and AIn, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple companies.
There were comments about the various aspects of the government in the United States when there were a number of reports about the AI, although the United States in general has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China proposed his plan last year: his goal in AInovation is to make it the best for 2030.
"AA would be a good beginning to double research, because the other countries are far from the United States, and we seek the next discovery in AA," said Lee.
Duplicate funding in the United States may double the chances of making great AI discoveries, Le said to CNBC in a week's interview.
Le, whose "I Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published this month, is the principal director of the Symphony Ventures, which has been investigated in one of the most important companys in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegee Mellon Universalsity, she worked on an AI system that over the American high-level Othello player, and later worked in Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the Chinese field.
Lee praised the technology contests in front of the U.S. government, among others the robotic competition of the former defense Projects, and asked when the next one will be, to help him identify the next dream.
The U.S. investigators have to work very hard to get the government's funding, says Lee.
"It doesn't mean China takes academic leaders, it's companies," Leek added.
Facebook, Google, and so many other other technology companies have taken the most intelligent college companies to play AI in the past few years.
Lee said that changing Immigration policy would also help the United States to encourage AI activities.
"I think green cards ought to be given automatically to Dr. AA," he declared.
In July 2017, the State Council of China developed a plan of development from the next Apparition of Artificial Understanding.
The National Science Foundation of China finances the people of academic institutions as it does the Science Foundation and other institutions of the Government in the United States, but in China it is less academic work, Lee says.
That year, earlier, the US Defense Department created a Artificienial intelligence center, where industry and education members were assembled, and the White House announced that it had formed the Artificiary Committee.
And this month, DRPA reported two billion dollars' investments in an enterprise called AI 86.
Like the NSF, he invests more than 100 million dollars a year in AI's research.
Meanwhile, the U.S.A.A.A.A.D.A.A.A.A.C.
To decide whether or not the Macedonians have changed the name of the country.
The land of Macedonia voted on Sunday by Reedemendum to change the name of the ancient Republic of Madedon. This change would put an end to the conflict of several decades since Greece had blocked the chance of being a member of the European Union and of NATO.
Greece, who formerly was in the province of Macedonia, still says that the name of the inhabitants of the north is taking up her own country, and blocking the opportunity of entering NATO and EBn.
The governments of both countries arrived at an agreement, founded on the new name proposed, but the national rivals say that this change is due to the etnic character of most of the Macedonian Slavians.
President Gjorge Ivanov declared that he would not vote in the referrendume, and that the bocots he made to the campaign had caused doubts about the 50 percent to be obtained in the reconnaissal reservatory.
This is the question which might be read on the role of the refrendum, "Are you on behalf of NATO and EB as a member of Greece?"
Those who are in favor of changing their name, including the Prime Minister Zev in Zoran, say it deserves a chance to enter the EB and NATO institutions for Macedonia, being one of the countries created when Yugoslavia was destroyed.
"I am going to vote about the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, because under the European Union's umbrella it will lead us to a safer life," said Oliver Georgijevsk, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Even though it's not legally bonded, enough members of the parliament have declared that they'll follow the results of the vote in order to be decisive.
To change the name, three-thirds of the parliament will be required.
The state selection committee declared that no surprise had been reported until one o'clock in the afternoon.
However, he's only voted by 16 percent, on the 34th of the last elections in 2016, in which he voted for the 6th percent of those who had the right to vote.
"It's our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevsky, 62 years old, capital voter Skopje.
The First Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zecca, and his son Dashko, changing the name of the country in Macedonia, and able to enter the Union of NATO and Europe, in Stramic, in Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, of 54 years old, was preparing a little stage and a staircase in front of the shops where they were trying to make a medicine to the reorientum.
"We are on the side of NATO and EB, but we want to meet with our conditions and not by the servants' door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to be Macedonia, we can look at China or Russia and we can be part of the Euro-Asia union."
The Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO can bring so necessary investment to Macedonia that the unemployment rate is 20 percent.
"I think most of it will be on the side, because it's more than 80 percent of the community's support to US and NATO," Zaev declared after the vote.
In his words, "Yes" would confirm our future.
Passed over on Monday, according to the industry published by the Polytical Research Organization in Macedonia, he'd take part in the voters' 30 to 43 percent of the voters during the voters' vote - less than necessary.
Another poll, Tellma TV of Macedonia, said that 57 percent of the residents thought they would vote on Sunday.
From these he declared that 70 per cent would be thrown away.
To be successful, you have to get 50 percent and a vote for it.
If there were a mistake in the Reservation, it would be the first serious mistake of the West politics since it began in May last year.
See, the Sergio Aguro player of the Manchester City team has overrun Brighton's entire defense to enter the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahem Sterling defeated the entire defense of Brighton at the 2-0 Saturday victory of Manchester City, Ethad Stadium football field, Manchester, England.
Aguero put the goal into 65 very easily.
The archgenine Gol picked up a paste in the middle of the field at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three defenders at Brighton before entering the open field.
Aguero suddenly saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed a defender away from many others at the edge of Brighton's area.
Then he walked to the left and there was Sterling.
The English preservator handed Aguro back the ball inside the area, and he used his right foot with the launch to the right of the network to cross Mathew Ryan at Brighton.
'There's more trouble at the foot of the day,' he declared to the journalists, the editor of City, Pep Guardio.
"We said he'd play 55 minutes or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were very glad he put his goal in it at that moment."
Butterling gave blue-shirts the initial advantage of Premier Legue.
In the 29th minute the goal arrived.
Aguero picked up the ball in Brighton field.
He gave Leroy San a splendid walk on the left.

City Hoffenheim will compete Tuesday at 12:55 p.m., Sinsheim's Rhein-Neckar-A's on the football field in Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end of the Rockies.
Once the Nationals were expelled from the competition, there was no great reason why they should be forced to another beginning.
However, Scherzer always wants to make an advantage of Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the Rockies still have the consequences of equality, which still have the advantage of a game for L.A. Dodgers in the NL West contest.
Rockie got at least 5-2 gains Nationals Friday night, but they still have to try to win the first degree.
"If we do anything, at least we know that the atmosphere in Denver will be crowded with people, and that the opposite team will act in the best degree in every part we're going to have to deal with this year.
Why shouldn't I compete with it?"
The Nationals still have to announce a launcher, but they seem to let Scherzer down in that situation.
Scherzer, who would be running his 34th, made a shoot-out on Thursday, and it seems like it's supposed to be acting as a shooter on Sunday.
The D.A.'s right is 18-7 to 2,53 and got 300 strikeout in 220/3 entries this year's season.
Tramp expressions in the West Virginia
The president looked over the situation and mentioned the state in which Brett Kavanaugh had been chosen when he was talking about the importance of parting in the Republicans during the mid-time elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We have five weeks of the most important elections in our lives.
He's one of the big ones -- I'm not candidates, but I am, so I'm in every place to compete with big candidates," he declared.
Trump added, "You can see the terrible group at the end of Democrats, you can see what's going on there.
And they have no doubt to take away the power to use any necessary means, the avarice of seeing and seeing.
They don't care who gets hurt, over whom we're going to get control and power, unless that's what we're gonna do."
The Democrats, he said, are intended to 'super and disturb'.
"Since you have seen him in the last four days," said he, "the Democrats are 'proper and wise,' and added, "they are foul and false."
He gave the name of Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Court of the Democratic Party, who received the shouts of the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Hey, hey, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for one -- that's the wrong language of the body - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labourists don't have much access.
He's an insectist with people who say what they think.
When the guys at the moment of my party voted against me, it wasn't a big surprise.
In fact, we were not welcome from the Laborists' MPs, I'm the last of the list, because I'm the last to say what we all thought.
Joan Ryan, who was a member of the Parliament, received a similar treatment because he spoke for anti-emmitism.
In my case, I was criticized by the censorship to disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, in the security of the nation, in Europe, the leaders before Jeremy did not agree in similar matters.
"We want to have meetings and producers about the meeting in East Nottingham on Friday."
During eight years I've been taking him as a local Laborists MP, that was the GC meeting on Friday night.
Unfortunately, today, it has never been thought of the word "loving, respectful politics" had ever been.
It is evident that there are different views in the labudo of the party, and that opinions are judged whether they are acceptable to the leaders of the party.
It started when Jeremy became the leader, when members of the same political views turned over 180 degrees, and asked for views that I would never have accepted, with respect to national security as well as the only market in America.
Every time I spoke in public -- it doesn't matter what I said -- a lot of opinions that in social networks accuse the central policies and demand to take me away from them. It happens that I should not be in the Labour Party.
That's not just my experience.
For I know that I have better luck than any of my colleagues, because opinions that have been thrown against me are political.
Every day I am subject to sexism or race chases by professionalism and honesty, but never by shame, to those who are to oppose them.
One of the unpleasant parts of the policy of this time is that it is regarded as a normal level of persecution.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week, announced that the Laborist Party should encourage the culture of tolerance.
In fact, we don't get one single opinion when in every motion of "unfiefation" or the rules of the party become narrower.
For the past two years I've had so many notes to lower my head that I don't talk so much, and so say, "I'd feel good."
But I'm not in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was a student, I left the room under the indifference of Thatcher's government, and entered public services that needed me most-as a local counselor or minister of government.
I've never concealed my political beliefs, not my last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will doubt my political views and my differences with today's leaders.
I'd say to those who encouraged the motion Friday, when our country is turning towards Brexite, where it's going to harm our houses, business, and public services, I don't understand that when I discuss my loyalty to the leaders of the laboist Party, I'm going to lose time and energy.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether it is part of the laboistic party-I am very proud of working for you, and I promise you that if I continue to work for what is best for your interests, I will not be separated from threats or from political files.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: There's Ayr who hasn't lost a game yet.
The last two unexpected attempts had somehow changed the final result, but, no doubt, Ayr deserved the victory at the game of the wonderful and fun championship.
They're in the first place of the board, and they're the only ones who haven't lost ten games.
At the end, they had a better defense, and they took better chances, and the family and the coach Peter Murchie have the right to be happy.
"We've been tested so far, and we haven't lost one, so we've got to be happy."
Robyn Christie of Melros added, "My honors to Ayr, because the chances were better used than us."
The trial of Grant Anderson 14 minutes later, which Frazier Clem had put before Ayr, but the yellow cards from Captain Rory Hughes, abandoned by Warriors, had been able to add points to Melrosi and Jason Baggnot.
Climos checked the leader of Ayr by penalty, and at the end of the first part he took up a solitary trial, and Ayr 17-5 went to rest.
But Melrose started on the second floor and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, which Baggot had done, had reduced the difference to five points.
Then there's been a long pause because of the grave lessy of Ruaridh Knot player, who was pulled out in the palm of his hand and, returning to the game, Ayr came a long way away when he turned the Stifford McDowall's rehearsal into Climok.
Then they took the yellow card from Captain Blair Macpherson Ayr, and Melros profited him to be one more man, with Bruce Colvine's essay that had not taken place, in a lively finish.
The family returned, and when Stroan Hutchinson was taken out of the yellow card to prevent Climo from having a ballon, he touched the ground behind the Maula of the Ayr, who was advancing by MacPherson.
Climo struck, as Kyle Row did almost from the beginning, caught David Armstrong's kick and threw Gregor Henry's wing in the fifth test of his family.
The star of the Still Game Series will perform a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems as if the actor Ford Keran wanted to jump into the world of the hostage, for he has been known to have been the director of a restaurant network.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show of whose writer and starman he's been a member of.
The pair announced that it would be the end of the show, the ninth season, and it seems that Kieran Craiglang is planning his life.
According to official records, he's Adifmorn Limited's director.
The actor doesn't mean anything about the story, even though the Scottish Sun sources said he wanted to put it into Kiernan Glasgow's most important homemark."
'The sea's ours: Bolivia expects courtiers to open their way back to Pacific.
Seamen's patrol equipment range headquarters in La Pazen.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
From the lake Titicaaca you can read the following motto on the bases of the Amazon ships: "The sea is ours by right.
To recover it is our duty."
During the interior Bolivia the conflict of the 20th century coast of Chile is still alive - because they still want to sail back into the Pacific.
Those hopes are perhaps stronger than in the last decades, because Bolivia expects to solve international courts after five years of reflection on October 1st.
"Bolivia has the right time, with the sense of union and tranquillity, and, of course, she's waiting for the result," says Roberto Callazadila, the diplomatly Boliviar.
Many Boliviars will follow the decision of the international court through the vast screens divided throughout the country, hoping that the Haga Court will give reason to Bolivia's demands - after the negotiation of the decades - because Chile has been forced to negotiate around the sea's supreme path.
Evo Morales, the charming native president of Bolivia - who's in conflict with re-electing next year -- has also given several contributions to the Monday resolution.
"We are very near returning to the Pacific, at the end of August," he said.
But some analists believe that the court will not decide for Bolivia, so that it won't change much.
The organization of the United Nations placed in the Low Countries has no capacity to give the land of Chile, and has declared that it will not decide about the results of the negotiations that may be present.
It means that the resolution of the International Court is over and there are six months after the negotiations, that the case was "not difficult," Paz Zaratt said, an international law expert in Chile.
And rather than encourage Bolivia's cause, it's been backwards for the past four years.
"The subject of the arrival of the sea has been taken as a captive by the American Boliviar administration," said Zaratt.
President Morales' rhetorical rhetoric in Chile has disappointed all his desire to do well, says he.
Bolivia and Chile still have to deal with a lot of subjects, but it'll be very difficult to keep on arguing after that.
Both countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Edward Rodríguez Velze, representative of Bolivia, does not agree with those who say that the court resolution is particularly intelligent.
On Monday Bolivia said, "It will be a great chance to restore to Chile" and "to put an end to the 139 years of ignorance," for both of them."
Calledilla declared that Morales did not agree - still one of the presumptive Presidents of South America - that the sea is the cause of political support.
"Bolivia will never deny the right of reaching the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is the possibility we should see over the past."
North Korea says nuclear dearme won't happen until he can believe in America.
The North Korean Minister, Ri Yong Ho says his country will not be disarmed until he can believe in Washington.
Ruk said that before the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to keep his promise before the leaders of the enemy at Singapore's top.
It was said by the fact that Mike Pompeius, Secretary of the United States, is within three months with Kim Jong Un, the North Korea of Singapore, to be able to re-lock nuclear diplomatation.
Ri says "topia" is the continuous punishments and the Korean War final expression to think that North Korea's objections to the United States will place North Korea at its feet.
Washington doesn't want to agree before Pyongyang makes his move to unarms.
Yes, Kim and the President of the United States are looking for the second summit.
But there's a great scepticism about the security of the country around which Pyongyang's serious about him is the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompey's plan is to go to Pyongyang next month to arrange the second summit between Kim and Trumpe.
In Paris's fashion show on the road to High Street next to you, he's shown the latest line of mass hats.
If you want to increase the collection of your capitals, or if you want to lock the sun completely, here's your answer.
Valentino and Thom Browne designors introduced a bunch of jewelled hats in a collection of spring Judah 2019 which made him tremble in the way he had shown him in the week of fashion in Paris.
Instagram hats that are not at all practical this summer, and these designers have taken their visible designs into the passage.
Valentinus's most remarkable pieces, with a feather-like hat, covered the heads of the models.
There is a kind of angurian, a rather strange hat, and also a kind of pineapple-but they are not designs to warm our heads.
Thom Brown also showed a collection of strange masks - in time for the Halloweet.
Many of the colored masks have their lips full, and Hannibal Lecter is like those of high tailory.
One of them looked like a diver's mask with glasses and tubes, while another one was carrying a glass of ice cream.
If you're a lover of fashion, you've got good news.
In style, experts say deaf people will go out to the streets, even to those around you.
The big-sized hats follow La Bomba, a straw hat that we saw from Rihanna, from the top of the two-legged wing, and put on what we saw to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the hat, which has succeeded in social networks, has taken another object into the passage - a straw bag on the beach, almost as large as the model in which it carries it.
The orange-colored bag, cut out with keel and white-skin handle, has been finished on the week of the Morda of the series of 2019 Spring to Jacquemus.
The stilist of Luke Armitage celerititi said in FEMAIL, "I've got big hats and large bags for the beach to get to the main streets next summer, it would be difficult to ignore the demand of the giant extras by the designer."
John Edward: Basic language capabilities for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland perform records of academic excellence, and have continued in 2018, independently of the results of studies, which have been strengthened in sports, as well as of the excellent results of the individual group, and which have been established in music and other projects of the community.
With 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, the Scottish Council of Invent Schools (SCIS) represent, the Scotch Council of the School Independents, the best service between students and their parents.
The aim of independent schools is to prepare them for high education, for their own career, and as citizens.
As we can design and implement a custom school curricum as a educational sector, we have seen modern languages follow the normal choice of students.
Nelson Mandel said, "If you talk to anyone in a language he understands, you'll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, you will arrive at his heart."
It's a strong way to remind people in other countries to build up relations and trust them that we don't only have to use English to make them trust us.
We can see from the results of recent examinations, that there are languages in the upper part of the more independent schools.
68% of the students who learn foreign languages have obtained the best classification A.
The data, assembled at school 74 by SCIS, shows that 72% of the students got the best classification A in the Chinese Mandraary, 72 per cent in German, 69 per cent in French, and 63 per cent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools of Scotland see foreign languages in the future as a necessary capacity for young men and children.
Languages, at present, are cultivated as an axis of teaching (e.g., technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the crucculums of independent schools as well as in others.
In 2014, one of the main reasons that was found at the time of fulfilling the job was that it was a language of inefficiency.
More and more, languages are becoming indispensable to prepare young men for future limes.
With more than the ranges which require language, these skills are indispensable in the globalized world.
Whatever your career is chosen, if they learn the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with the advantage of such a life.
The ability to speak directly to the people of foreign countries will automatically put the man in the head of the public contest.
According to the inquest made by YouGov in 2013, 4,000 adults, 75 per cent couldn't speak foreign languages, so that there was an ordinary conversation, and he went up to a two-digit number between those who talked only in French, 15 per cent.
That's why it's so important to make investments in the language today's children.
Speaking more than one language, especially those used in economic development, will give your children more opportunities of finding a better job.
In Scotland they differ according to the language which they teach them.
Some students prefer more modern languages, and others seem to be important to the E.G., or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child are, there will always be a great chance of learning in independent school with teachers who are expert in the country.
The object of the independent schools of Scotland is to prepare children for their future success in different tasks and to provide tools for it.
We can't deny it this time in an international business environment where languages are indispensable for the future of the country, so we need reflection in education.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "annational communication ability."
The independent schools will continue to offer their choice, multiplicity, and excellence to the young of Scotland.
Il faut's le faaire.

LeBron will do it on Monday with the Deut Lakers in San Diego
LeBron James's first-class star is about to end up waiting for the fans in Los Angeles.
Lakers' coach, Luke Walton, has declared James will play against Denver Nuggets on Monday's front season, San Diego.
But he hasn't yet specified how many minutes he'll be playing.
"More than one and less than 48," said Walton at Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudelle, who is a Lakers reporter, said that James will play on Twitter for a while.
After this week's training, James was asked by the Lakers about six previous match.
"I don't need a match in the first season to prepare for my career," he answered.
Trumpe's West Virginia Time Rally, YouTube Channel
President Donald Tramp will begin the Rallly campaign ball tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
The next week of Trumpe's, he'll be the first of the five Rallies, and he'll visit several places he has, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
They'd be waiting for the vote to confirm the execution of the Supreme Court, Trump wants to get support or protection for elections that will be in the first-term retaliation. The Republicans are in danger of losing the control of Congress in November elections.
What time is the mitina of West Virginia today, and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trumpe's tour is starting at 7 p.m. today, September 29th, 2018.
You'll be able to see the mitina of West Virginia online through the Youtub stream.
It seems that Trumpe will correct the hearings of the Supreme Court of this week of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, until the confirmation of the Senate which has held the vote for the unapproachable sexual attitude of your position.
But the principal aim of this revolution of the myths is to help the Republicans win a few votes at the elections of November.
So President Trump's campaign says that the five million next week's plan is to raise up "bolts and help the Republicans in the Senate and the maximum of their representatives" according to Reuters.
"The Congress has an extraordinary importance, and the President will travel as far as possible to the most states as possible," said Trumpe's campaign voice, which did not allow the Reuters agency to be registered.
The program for Wesbanco Aren's will allow today's mitina Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters and communal media in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
It will be Saturday the second time Trump visited West Virginia in 2016 for 40 per cent.
He's trying to help the Senator Patrick Morrisey, who's following him.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey to have the president to go there to help us in the elections, says Simon Header, a scientist policy in the University of West Virginia according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Attempting to continue a single-day U.S. team contest
After three sessions on one side, the four o'clock on Saturday afternoon had been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is the concept of sport invented from top to bottom, in which players believe, but not for other competitions.
So, where can you say the moment is now?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now they have four, so I think it's time now, somehow," said Jordan Spieth, making a day's field.
Of course, Europe has an advantage over four-pointed twelve of the stakes.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind is not on their side, and they need help, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and got three points from four.
Spike has been completely decisive, from the draw to the green, and is correcting by the pattern.
Those screams of celebration have grown louder and louder as the shifts go on, and he's put the big bet down, winning four al-squares, after Thomas lost two after two.
15. He celebrated it with another cry of the like putta won at the game, which shows that the American group is not outside the contest.
"You must look for ants and take care of your game alone," Spieth said.
It's what's left of those players.
18 holes to get out of.
The only players that have had more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molina and Tommy Fleetwood, the historical players of the Ryder Cup.
The European special but charming couples are four to four to see if they're wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who hadn't fired a bégey Saturday afternoon, but on Saturday morning, even Friday afternoon, they had bongs, and on Friday the last nine o'clock.
This turn and the energy that came from it to the noise of the crowd turned into a couple to be passed on Sunday, and there was no more famous European players than Fleetwood and Molina when the sun rises to close the victory of Europe in Le Golf National.
It's better if they're both in different holes at the same time.
Still, it's early to talk about the great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson's work was quickened by Sergio Garcea, the best for fourst, when Alex Nora was equals.
One boy and two doubles have been placed before the Spanish and the Swede was never too close to a hole.
But on Sunday, there wasn't anyone to help you get out of your hole.
The Fourtta was fascinated by the sight of the close couples, the advice they gave, the ones they didn't give, and the way they could change their strategy for a moment.
Europe had done better as a team, and had a remarkable advantage over the finalist, but the game of the flat showed that the U.S. team had the courage to fight, although some of them, in particular Stateside, hesitated.
Europe has won 10-6 advantages in the World Cup
Europe has a remarkable advantage over Ryder Cup's finance, after the Saturday fours have been won by 10-6 American States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molina's inspired couple got two victories against Tiger Woods, and now they got four valuable points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn of Europe, two years ago trying to get back the prize lost in Hazelin, became master of the morning, and won three-1 series.
The United States offered a more resistance, and they won two games, but they couldn't go beyond the difference.
It took them eight points on Jim Furyk's side to keep the prize in 12 o'clock on a Sunday.
Fleetwood is the only European rooke that won four points after four points, and with Molina, to which after a magnificent weekend they are called "Molliwood," they are the second to win four points in the history of the Ringer Cup.
After having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs, he played splendidly tired Woods and Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4 lights.
Woods, after having played two games on Saturday, he showed them a touch of excellence, but from 29 games he lost 19 in the fourballs and foursoms after seven.
Justin Rose rested for the morning fourball and came back with Henrik Stenson on fours to conquer Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the best and third of the world.
Europe did not find its way into the pleasant, cool day of the southwest of Paris.
The Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomase, gained three times, set up a reference to the Americans, two points on Saturday.
2-1 a vague victory was won against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Pulter in the fourballs and then they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy after having lost two initial holes in fours of four.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team has managed to get over four-point points and go into individual places, although Furyk's side needed only a draw to keep the prize.
After having been the second best, in two days, after the opposite method on Sunday, they will be placed in front of him.
North Korea has given a negative turn to leave weapons without any confidence in them.
The foreign minister of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the punishments continued to prevent their confidence in the United States, and that they would by no means cease to produce a nuclear weapon.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's integer Bilgura that North Korea had taken up "sacredly significant measures," to interrupt nuclear weapons and missile tests, to leave places for nuclear tests, and to speak of what will cease to develop nuclear technology and nuclear weapons.
"We don't see any proper answers from the United States," he said.
"There is no confidence in our national security without the confidence of the Americans, and we can never leave the first weapons alone."
He repeats the familiar complaints of North Korea about the resistance of Rik Washington inside a process of denucleisation where North Korea would have been slowly rewarded for taking steps. His statement seems to indicate that he hadn't rejected the unfathomable denutation of Pyongyang in the past.
Rik Kim Jong Hour and Donald Tramp mentions the first summit of Singapore on the 12th of June the President of America and North Korea.
North Korea is looking for a way to end the Korean War between 1950-1953, but the United States of America have declared that Pyongyang must leave the first weapons.
Washington has ignored the international voices that asked him to ease the penalties imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S.A. says he's going to have to leave his first weapons again, and the pressure of punishment still increases to the necessity of getting their goal, and it's against the declaration of the end of the war," said Rik.
"To think that punishment will place us at their feet is the outopia of those who do not know us.
The problem is that continuous punishments are increasing confidence."
Rik hasn't mentioned the second summit between Kim and Trump announced by the leader of the United States in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
The minister, on the other hand, mentioned three meetings during the last five months between Kim and the Moon Jae leader of South Korea and added, "If the other party were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuction of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked."
However, the tone of his speech in Ri would be quite different in the past year, when he declared that in the whole Union of the NB, North Korea had necessarily looked at the United States, since Mr. Trump, Mr. President, called Kim "sister" on the suicide mission.
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trumpe, who declared that North Korea was to be destroyed because of the courage to take the weapons off Kim's hands, but he declared that it was still necessary to do it and that they would continue with punishment until he had denucle North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for that, "even if it's two years, three years, or five months."
China and Russia believe that the Security Council of the United Nations ought to reward Pyongyang for his steps.
But the Secretary of the State of the United States, Mike Pompeius, declared before the UN Security Council on Thursday, "We must continue to strengthen the penalties of the Council of Security until we find that its denuclorization is real."
The Security Council encourages North Korea in one mouth after 2006 as an attempt to lock up nuclear programs and ballistic programs in Pyongyang.
Pompey met with Ri outside the NB's Integer Bilgera, and then he announced that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare the second summit.
Pompey's been in North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't work out.
When he returned from Pyongyang in July, saying that there was only one thing for North Korea, after he had been accused of "the demand made by gangsters" during hours."
North Korea swore that in a meeting with Moon they would leave the missile places and a nuclear complex if the United States took their proper measures."
He said to Kim that the measures he was looking for were security warrants offered by Trump to Singapore, and he was turning to normalization with Washington.
The students of Harvard have done their best to take a good rest course.
He will sleep more and more on the sub-graded years of the year of Harvard University, trying to resist the culture of those who learn to spend their evenings with coffee.
A teacher saw that in the best colleges in the world students lose their prizes in a basic way to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor of sleep at the University of Harvard, and a specialist in the hospitals of Brigham and Women, designed the course which he thinks is the first of that kind of EB.
He began his course when at the time of study he had given a speech about the lack of sleep.
"A girl came over to me and said, 'Why am I supposed to do that alone in the last year of my school?'
They said nobody told him how important it is to sleep well, and that surprised me," said the Telegraph.
In the course of the year, dedicated for the past year, the effect of the well-advised habits of sleeping and of the sporting results is explained to the students, not only in order to improve their well-being.
Paul Barrett, professor of the University Medical School, and the head of the college health services, declared that he had decided to set off his course when the students saw that he slept little during the week.
The long-hour course takes several interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom in which students can see the effect of coffee pots, curtains, coaches, and books, and the effect of the caffè and light, and of the importance of the habit of sleeping too little at sports and of going to bed.
In another section, it is explained that too little sleep can increase the danger of heart attack, depression, or cancer.
On a map of Campus, used by interactive icons, the members of the community are invited to reflect on their daily habits.
"We know that we will not suddenly change the habits of students.
But we think they have the right to know, if you choose to smoke cigarettes, as you have the right to know the consequences of your health," added Czeisler.
There's still some pride in "night" culture, he says, and it's more and more pressure the modern technology and the students are making.
To sleep well, to sleep well with good quality, should be to the stress, fatigue, and impatience "a secret charm," he said, "and to win weight, because a little sleep makes the brain hungry and we'll always be hungry.
Raymond So, chemist of 19 years of chemical and physical biology, has helped Professor Czeisler design his course, and he had one of his first classes in the first year of Harvard.
The student declared that he had opened his eyes and that he had led him to join a campus course.
The next step, he expects, would be to ask for an inquiry equal to those in the degree before entering the competition.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students should be alarming them for going to bed, and also to wake them up, and to know the effects of the injurious effect of the "blue light" which is sent by the electric screens and the light LEDs, which may alter the circulating rhythms, and cause them to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga has passed Gerrrard's men
The Rangers have suffered another failure from Dolly Menga's str-0 for Steven Warrd's 1-0 in Livingston.
On the Ibrox side of February 4-1 St. Johnston they wanted to win for the first time, but Gary Holte's team caused the second failure of the Warrede team as coaching in his 18th game, leaving his eight points without control by the Hents of the Landbokes leader of the championship.
Menga had seven minutes before the strike break, and Rangers' work did not draw.
The Rangers have now descended to the sixth place, and Livyston has gone up to the third, and after Hibernians they are only for the sake of the gulf.
The problem might have been more serious for the Rangers because they had to treat Calum Space's wing by a wound from the head because it was hit by an object that had been thrown from the outside.
Warrd made eight changes and managed to reach the center of the Ayr Befred Cup.
Here, on the other hand, Livi 11 went with him, who took a point at the Hearts last week, and would be glad to see how his well-adjusted suit drowned his opponent in every turn.
Rangers subdued property, but Livingston profited more from their plays.
Scott Pittmani of Menga's wing would have to get a goal thrown through Allan McGregor, but the halfman didn't take advantage of it.
A deep, free launch of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate was only able to get Alan Lethgow away from the post behind him.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third they seemed to hope more than belief.
Alfredo Morelos seemed to him to be a penaltic on the quarter when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson didn't notice the appeals of the Coonbian.
Rangers had only two throws in the first half, but Lim Kelly of Ibrox had hardly any trouble with Lassana Coulbaly's head and the slight blow of Ovie Ejaria.
The first goal into which Livi had entered 34 minutes might have damaged the development of the game, but no one can deny that they deserve it by considering their great effort.
The Rangers never managed to face a game of Jacobs' ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Decla Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Menga to make a simple ending.
Warrd took his hand at rest changing Coulbaly with Ryan Kent, and the change took immediate effect when the wing passed to Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran off his line to lock it up.
But the Livingstons continued to force the outside to play their game after long walks with Lithgood and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase its advantage, but McGreagor had a firm grip on him before the head of the Lithgoodner.
Rangers' substitute, Glenn Midleton, ordered a penalty again at the end when he was stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson never paid any attention to him again.
Almacka: Geiger counter inventor
And now our " Sunday Morning" almanca page, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and DENBORA... to the future physics, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting radioactivity and measuring-the invention followed by what Geiger was called the counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a bit of science, and the pop culture border has become like the "Bells of Coronado" in 1950, where no scientific appearance was made by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans cowboy.
Man, what the hell is that?
Rogers: "It's the Geiger counter, it's used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you place these listeners, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by mineral radioactivity."
Evans said, "Yes, you hear me right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, missing a few days after 63 years.
But the invention that carries his name is still alive.

The method of extracting cells from the patient and then renting them in the laboratory
Then they can see a protein that is common to many cancers and then reject it.
The glamor test is giving a very good result in patients with several kinds of cancer.
The immunity system of a woman who was treated with the jackhole that the bad cell teaches to know, was managed to get cancer out of the ovarium for more than 18 months.
This is the method of extracting cells from the patient and renting them in the laboratory, in order to "see" a proteine common to many of the cancers called HER2, and then rescheduleing cells.
Jay Berzofsky, the National Institute of the United States of Bethesda (Maryland) said, "Our results show that we have a great future chatto."
HER2, including the cancer of the breast, the obulator, the lungs, and the honestness of many kinds, explained Professor Berzofsky.
When we get the cell immune from the patients, and get to the carcinogeneous cells, it's worked out by a similar approach to "in the course of the week" in treating a kind of leukemia.
He went into a cave on Cane West Tramp, wearing an MAG hat after the SNL show.
It didn't work out.
Canye West was shouted in the studio when he said he would come and be president of the United States president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a American Grete hat, began to speak evil against Democrats and confirmed his position in Trump's favor.
"Whenever I talk to a white person, they say to me, 'How do you like Trump, because he's a racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about maleism, I must have left America long ago,' he said.
In that SNL, in Christine Blasey Ford's sexual accusations, Brett Kavanaugh played the movie witness to the Judial Committee of the Senate.
Even though he wasn't red, the performer of West brought Chris Rock to social nets.
It's not clear that Rock West was trying to make him laugh about publishing.
Besides, he complained in front of the West Public that he had been through a bad time with his hat between his wings.
"I have been attacked among the wings.
They told me, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been attacked!
And then they say I'm in a deep place," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the place where I'm going to do this?" saying, "I'm going to wear my superman cloak, which means you can't tell me what I'm going to do?
Try your love."
In consequence of his words, at least a couple of times his whistles came from the public and the members of the SNL session seemed to be ashamed, as Variety announced, and a person in it said to the magazine, "The whole studio was completely silent."
They brought him at the last moment of the West to replace Adriana Grande, whose boyfriend had died a few days before, the Raac Miller Rapera.
Web surprised many people with the interpretation of I love the song, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West had the support of Candace Turner, head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, who had published the "Pedacy" to one of the most daring spirits, "ESKERNING IN THE AFLIT"
But the interview show was being introduced by Karen Hunter, who was simply being "as he is, and that's wonderful."
"But I do not wish to reward a man who does a ideology which is injurious to the community (by buying his music or his clothes or protecting his art).
He's free.
And so are we,' he added.
Before the show, the Raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was the creature named Kane West until now.
He's not the first artist who changes his name, and he follows Diddy's footsteps, because he's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and PDdy.
His colleague, Snoop Dog, the Raper, also called Snoop Lion, and how not to mention the late Prince's musical legend that changed his name to a symbol and made him the artist who had hitherto been a Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington stands against the toxic masculinity
The role of Kit Harington Jon Snow is known to the Sword Game of Thrones HBO in the biolential series of the Middle Ages of the Middle Ages.
But the 31-year-old actor has appeared against the stereotyper of the machista hero, declaring that in consequence of the appearance of these papers on the screen, young men must often feel strong to be respected.
In the expressions of The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said, "Something has been done wrong," and in the days of #MToo he asked how to resist the toxic maculinium problem.
Kit also married Rose Lesliee, who is a star of the Game of Thrones, and who is 31, and she admitted that she is "sincted."
"Personally, and with great certainty, I think at this moment-" What have we done badly with maculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they're growing up, considering the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television can also have its responsibility as far as the ascent of the toxic macculinity, because it is a very masculinous character.
He went on, "What's natural and what's teaching?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets that makes young men feel that they have to do this way of being a man?
I think that's one of the important issues of our time.
It's obvious something went wrong for young men."
He agreed, too, that he will not do anything before the series of Game of Thrones or when the series is over the next summer, and he said, "He's done with the battlefields and the horses."
From November, Kit Sam Shepard's coming back to West, the story of a film producer and his brother, he's a thief.
The actor recently reported that Rose his wife was the best thing he ever had to do with Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife at this session, and so she gave me my future family and a future life," he said.
Rose made Ygrit's role, the woman Jon Snow loves, in the imaginary series that won Emmy's prize.
The couple got married in June 2018 in a house of Leslie's family in Scotland.
GIB/ Hiesa: China reports that 14% uploads have been in new cases
China reports that 14% of the climb has been the number of citizens with GIB and Hiesa.
There are more than 820,000 people in the country, as the medical authorities have said.
More than 40,000 new cases registered only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are transmitted by sex, which is a change to the past.
By tradition, GIB was rapidly spread over some of the Chinese areas, due to the blood-transfactions that had been infected.
But in this way the number of people who were infected with GIB was reduced to almost zero, as the Chinese medical authorities said at a conference in Yunnan.
But for years, the number of people in China with GIB and Hies has been raised by 100,000 people.
A sexual GIB transmission is a serious problem in the Chinese LGTB community.
Homosexuality was decriminating in China in 1997, but LGTB is a highly expanded distribution against people.
According to the state's curator values, it has been calculated in research that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are married to a woman.
Many transmissions from disease are related to the use of improper sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised an universal access to the GIB medicalization within the effort to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters refused the workers to leak the leaked GOP data and turned them upside down by "degs of dangerous water" and "conspiration theories."
Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that a member of her crew had published personal information on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators' media.
The L.A. Democrats have indicated that the statements were "strunk to right" experts and websites.
"More lies, lies, and lies of contempt," Waters said in an expression on Twitter.
In the published information, three American senators were found information about Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Page Huch, both of them Utah.
The information came online on Tuesday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill, at a hearing of the improper sexual report against Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of the Senate.
The leak was questioned by the three senators, Kavanaugh, and came back later.
As the curators of Gateway Purdit and RedState announced, the IP address that identifies the source was associated with Waters' office and published information from a member of Waters' team, Hill declared.
"It's quite false and absolutely false," said Waters.
"The members of my team" -- who have been compromised by their personal information and security, "have no responsibility for the leaking of that information.
The groundless Allegation is absolutely false and absolutely false."
Waters' statement was immediately received by the critic on the line by Ari Fleischer, the former press writer of the White House.
"It's made of anger," Fleischer wrote.
"That shows he has no character for a member of Congress.
When he's accused of something he hasn't done to anybody, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to show challenge.
He mustn't question the reasons for the accused.
He must be calm and brave."
Fleischer seemed to want to compare the reaction of Waters to the review of the democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who had been too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a republican candidate who wants to remove Waters during the elections of the central legislature, expressed his opinions on Twitter.
"If the meaning is true," he bit.
In his statement, Waters said that he had observed his offices as to these fraudulent expressions that were suitable to the authorities and to the execution of the law.
"We ensure that those who have broken the law will know what they are," he continued, "and that they will have to answer before the law for any member of my company, and for every action that is injurious and dangerous to all my fellow-citizens."
Johnny English Strikes Aover film
Now it's traditional to find the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British beam, and that seems not to be applicable to Johnny English's pantry of action. He started on 2003 with Johnny English and came back again with Johnny Englysh Strorn.
Can we get a new export option for our nation by pointing out what kind of rubbish we are?
In any case, the fact that big out-eyed and rubber-faced Johnny English has renewed his license to fuck things up for the second time-his name shows above everything that he's a great comic creation designed for countries where he's not an English film.
Although he is curious to find a flattering Glamour, he is a stupid secret agent with a certain resemblance to Clouseu, of course, a ray of Mr. Bean's and part of the boy's assistant in the Olympic Games of the 2012 in London with a single note.
In Barclaycard's television advertisements we've forgotten, Atkinson interpreted it, it's also based on the mysterious international man, leaving chaos behind.
There's a bad moment or two on this last trip of JE.
I loved Johnny English coming up to the helicopter in a half-year-old armor, and the bishop's cross struck him on the helmet.
On the screen you see the gift of Atkinson's comedy, but the mood lacks strength and is a superfluus, especially when a film print like 007 and Miss Illion Imovable is now included among their elements by the gravely grave.
The humor seems to be more addressed to children than to adults, and to me the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and intelligent as Bean's jokes in Atkinson's silent films.
The continuous stopup is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyberhacker has been infiltrated by the Superscretian spy website of Britain, showing the identity of all the British agents who are working, and he's upset about the service agent. Unfortunately little paper for Kevin Eldon.
That's too much for a first minister who's got pomperous and persecuted character, because he's already losing political reputation, Emma Thompson seems almost the best to do with a character like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligence counsels inform him that all active spys have been compromised by the fact that he's going to have to recover someone who's retired.
And that means that Johnny English himself can walk as well as he can, now he's a professor in a smart place, but he's giving confidential schools about doing it as a secret operator, a few fine jokes that Englysh offers 'School of Rock'.
English is sent back to Whitehall to make an emergency information meeting, and he meets up with Bough, his former partner, Ben Miller interprets him again.
He's a married Bough now, attached to a submarine host, and Vicki Pepperdine loses a little bit in the way of a rich boy.
So, in Your Highness's Secret Service, we're back in Batman and Robin's action to the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova femme fatale of Olga Kurylen.
Meanwhile, the first minister, who says that he can repair the informal misfortunes of Great Britain, is fascinated by that crafty Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
The English and Brough start their stories, disguised as servants, and set fire to a French restaurant, which is a cassa in the luxury of Volta's yacht, and English excites complete anarchy when he tries to use virtually to see what Volta's house is like when he tries to use the helmets of virtual reality.
All pauses look at this final sequence, but even though it's pleasant and noisy, it's a lot on the TV for kids.
That's just the way it is.
And as it happened to me in Johnny English with other movies, I thought, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a paper worth his talent?
The Labour Party has denied that the British are preparing a plan for four days' work in a week, but five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Laborist Party is looking at a radical plan that the British will work for a week, but expect five days to collect.
The chief of the firm seems to wish that the party should be spared by the revolution of artificial intelligence, and give them a more holiday.
The workers would be on the weekend for three days, but they would still take the same salary home.
The sources have shown that the Idea goes right into the economic book of the party and wants to turn the country to the workers.
Going to four-day week's union support has been received by Congress, as a means of profiting by the workers of changing economy.
A higher captain of the Labour Party has announced to the Sunday Times, "Before the end of the year a political announcement is expected.
"It won't happen from one day to another, but there's a week of four days' work with the view of the party to solve the economy and the general industry strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the party that protects an idea of this kind, because the Green Party defended four days' work week in the battle of general elections in 2017.
At any rate, the inspiration has not yet supported the whole Labour Party.
"Four days' work week is not the policy of the party, and the party does not consider it."
Minister John McDonnell in the shadow used the Congress of Labour Party last week to determine his view of a socialist economy revolution.
Mr. McDonnell said, no doubt, that the power of the 'unfaceed directors' and 'spucculators' should be taken away in the enterprises offered public services.
On the planet of the shadow minister, the current stocks of the water department may not receive their entire share if they are seen to have some misguided behavior.
Moreover, he confirmed that there were plans to put in workers in companies and to create property Inclusive funds, to give ten percent of the capital of private sectors to the ten workers who could collect five hundred pounds of license.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy call it "60 Minutes" the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh, whether or not they can change their opinion or not.
As for the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the FBI has delayed its nomination for at least a week to the Supreme Court, and has hesitated whether the consequences of the investigation might or may not be allowed to secure the protection of a republican senator.
In a conversation sent on Sunday, Scott Pelley, the correspondent of 60 Minuts, asked the republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could change their opinion.
Kennedy appeared more open than his companion in South Carolina.
'I think so, of course,' said Kennedy.
'I said when I went to the audience, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called after this, I said, "Did you do that?"
He replied plainly.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be written on the stone.
'I've decided about Brett Kavanaugh and he'll take an explosion too,' he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it firmly," Graham added, reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who speaks of it has been able to verify it.
She's 36.
I can't see anything new has changed."
What has Global Citiz been doing to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the Global Citiz festival will be played in New York, a yearly music program that brings enormous artists, and has an enormous mission-the poverty of the world.
With the seventeenth edition this time, the Guild Citizi party will bring thousands to the Great Course of Central Park, not just to enjoy the shows of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase the consciousness of the true end of the act, that is to say, the extreme poverty being destroyed before 2030.
The Global Citiz festival, created in 2012, is an extension of the Project of Global Poverty. This project is just an international team that expects poverty to disappear by increasing the number of people fighting actively against poverty.
To pick up a free entry for the occasion (if you're not ready to pay for a VP ticket), those who want to go to the concert need to do a lot of tasks or actions like sending an electronic message to a world leader, making a telephone call or another way to help increase the consciousness of the end of poverty.
But what success has Global Citiz succeeded when he's 12 years old to carry out his goal?
Is it a original idea to encourage people to perform an action by a free concert, or to make them feel that they are making a real change by signing an online request or sending them a gum?
Since 2011, Global Citiz says he has registered more than 19 million "actions" of his followers by pressureing so many ends.
As he says, the world leaders have urged the world leaders to announce more than 37 billion policies and commitments, and these policies and engagements will affect more than 2.25 billion people's lives before 2030 years.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 engagements and predictions derived from action, and of which at least ten billions have already been paid or received.
As the team calculates, the established funds have had direct impact on a 649 million people throughout the world.
In the United States there is the Power of Nutrition, a society of investors and operating agents who have an engagement to help them develop their whole potential, a dwelling place in the United Kingdom.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, of donations, of national governments, and of members of the Global Citiz as you are," said The Power of Nutrition publicly in a direct concert in London.
Besides, the group has said that after more than five thousand actions to improve the performance of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the government announced that the project of Power of Nutrition would be financed by the intervention of 5 million women and children in this project.
In reply to this question of FAQ on the website, "What makes you think we can destroy extreme poverty?"
Global Citiz answered, "It will be a long and difficult road, and we will fall sometimes, and we will fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and apartheid before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle will be Monáe, and Janelle will be present at the show of this year in New York, and Deborra-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Army to slow down Russian power reports as "block"
Washington could use his army to avoid reaching the Russian markets, including the Middle East, the inner writer of Ryan Zinke U.S., as Washington has mentioned.
Zineke has declared that the relationship of Russia with Syria is obviously where the legitimate government is operating -- it's just an excuse to search for new energy markets.
"I think it's the reason they want to negotiate in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern stomach of Europe," he declared, according to information.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means of handling it.
'The United States with our Army are able to assure us that the sea lines are open, and, if necessary, to lock them up, to make sure that their energy doesn't reach the market,' he said.
The members of an event organized by the Alliance of Power for Consulists were talking to them-that is to say, of a party organized by a team of gainers in the United States, who represent themselves as the voice of energy.
Washington compared the approaches to Russia and Iran, explaining that they are the same after all.
"The economic option we have in regard toran and Russia is, more or less, to use and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "one-free economy" of fossil fuel.
Trump's administration of his liquid natural gas for exporting to Europe, and Russia, that is to say, an option much cheaper for European consumers, has been introduced during a reconnaisance mission.
For that purpose, Trump's administration officials, and even Donald Trump, the President of the United States, trying to persuade Germany Nord Stream 2 to get out of the gas project, which renders Moscow "gatrib" in Berlin Trump.
Moscow has insisted that the Nod Stream 2 gas tracks of 11 million dollars, which will double the capacity of the existing gasway to the 110 billion meters cube, is just an economic project.
Kremlin says that the passionate attitude against the project is simply caused by economic reasons, and that it is an example of a faithless competition.
"I think we agree that energy can't be a pressure tool and the consumers ought to be able to choose providers," Aleksandr Novak said, after a meeting in Moscow with Rick Perry the American power writer.
The attitude of the United States has had a negative reception from Germany, and has confirmed its commitment to project.
The major organization of the German industry, the Industria National Federation, the EB energy policy, and the two-sided agreements between Berlin and Moscow, has asked the United States not to enter.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our power condition," Dieter Kempf said, after a few days ago, the head of the Industry for the German Federation (BDI), Angela Merkel German Canazille and the President of the Russian Putin.
Elizabeth Warren says, "He's going to investigate" in 2020 to run for president, Senator of Massachusetts.
The Senator of Elizabeth Warren Massachusetts said on Saturday that he was going to run for the president after the election in the middle of the legislature.
Warren confirmed that he was going to go to a town hall in Massachusetts.
"It's time for a woman to reach Washington and repair our broken government, which requires a woman upstairs," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6th Star, I shall examine deeply to introduce myself to the president."
Warren gave his opinion of Donald Tramp in the Town Hall, saying that he was taking the country the wrong way.
"I am very worried about what Donald Tramp is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has spoken clearly to Trump and the Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavanaugh, when he's criticized.
In a lighter published on Friday, Warren said, "It's clear, we need an investigation of the FBI before we vote."
In any case, a steed published on Thursday has shown that most of Warren's electors don't think he's supposed to run for president in 2020.
Forty-eight percent of the Untestable Electors of Massachusetts said that the senator should not present himself as president according to the inquest of the Policical Research Center of Suffolk University, the Boston Globe.
thirty-two per cent, however, appeared on the side of the introduction.
According to the poll, the opportunity to present the former governor Deval Patrick has been protected by 38 per cent by an imaginary presentation and appears against 48 percent.
There are other names which have been given in regard to a potential presentation in 2020, including Vice President Joe Road and Senator Bernie Sanders Vermont.
On the way he said he was officially going to decide for January, as Associaized Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentioned the confusion of the stress after the trauma in Track Palin during Donald Tramp election.
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year after entering Iraq's September.
They arrested him for domestic violence and charged him on Monday night.
"Because my son is suffering from what he's been doing when he comes back, I'm identified with the consequences of the disturbance of trauma, and the other families that we're able to bear when we get back to our soldices," he said to the audience of an election for Donald Tramp in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said that it was a remarkable matter of arrest, and he said of his son and other veterans in the war, "they come back in a sort of change, and they return hard, asking if there is such respect for their fellow soldiers and fellow-citizens in the Air Force, and for what all the rest of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday at Wasilla, Alaska, and he was accused of domestic violence against a woman, with a statement that he was in a state of domestic violence and insecurity, including the voter of Dan Bennett Wasilla's police.
18 states, D.C.
The Distric of eighteen states and Columbia are protecting the legislation against a new policy of America which refuses the ass to victims who are escaping from their standards or domestic violence.
The 18 states and distributors introduced a friendly statement on Friday to protect an asyllist from Washington, deficiencing the police, as NBC News reported.
It is not known to the Federal policy that the entire name of the accused of Grace v. Sessions, introduced by the American Union for civil freedom in August.
He said his partner "and his partner at the violent band" had caused sexual abuse, but the U.S. officials refused to ask him for the astolic request he had made on the 20th of July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the State who are protecting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which create a large number of American aspirins, because countries with trays and domestic violence are in trouble.
The new asila policy of the United States was revoked by a decision taken by the Apial Committee of the Immigators, who allowed the immigrators to demand assilas, who were escaping from domestic violence.
As Karl Racine Columbia's Chief Attorney General said on Friday, "the new policy ignores the year's state, faith, and international law."
"The Federal law says that all ascetic requests ought to be assigned from the particular facts and circumstances of the request, and such a bar breaks that principle," declared the expression of amcus curiæ.
Besides, the lawyers argued that the policy which denies the immigators in writing harms the economy of the United States, which has more probability of becoming an activator, and of offering the "necessary Hand."
The Chief Attorney General Jeff Sesions ordered the judges to stop giving more of the domestic violence and the victims who were running away from violence.
"The philosopher is available in the pursuit of their country, or in the fear of being members of a race, religion, nationality, or political opinion," said Sesions, when he introduced the politics of June.
The ass has never been used to solve every problem that people live every day, even though they're in serious trouble.
Trying to make a desperate rescue in Palu while the number of the dead is doubled, to find those who live in the race.
For those who survived, the situation became more and more serious.
"He feels a lot of anxiety," said Mother Risa Kusuma of 35, who was feverish in the ruined city of Palu.
"Death brings ambulances every minute.
There's no clear water left."
The inhabitants were seen to return to their desolate houses, to take their own things taken by the water, and try to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people are hurt, and hospitals, 7.5 earthquakes are exhausted.
Some of the wounded, Dwils Haras, with broken shoulders and shoulders, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital.
Tears fell from her eyes, telling her how she felt the violent movement of earthquake when she was in the hotel room with her wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I crushed myself against the sand of the wall," said Haris to Associad Press, and added that his family was in town for a marriage.
"I heard her asking for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador has charged China with "opportunities"
An official Chinese newspaper, after placing in an ABE paper a four-page announcement that supported each other's advantages in trade between America and China, has charged Beijing Beijing with the American press used by the ambassador of the United States.
Donald Tramp the President of China in Des Moines Register, the second paper that is most sold in Iowa, mentioned the additional paid last Wednesday, after having accused China of attempting to access the elections of the U.S. of the 6th of November.
The fact that he was trying to break into the American elections in Beijing has been marked by Trump as the U.S. officials said to Reuters, and he was raising a new campaign in Washington to press China.
Even if it's normal that foreign governments should promote commercial trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked up in a business war that's rising.
China's traversal radiators, at the beginning of the trade, had been protected by Trump's Republican Party by the thought that they were about to attack the exports of such states as Iowa, as the writers of China and U.S.'s.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador of China, and the governor of Iowa for a long time, namely, of one of those states who export most goods to China for farming, has declared that Beijing has harmed America's workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an article of Sunday's Des Moines Register, "Chinna is now strengthening the attack by putting propaganda in our free press."
"By spreading Propaganda, he's using strong traditions for the free press and the liberty of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the press line of the Rue de Beijing, there is very few disconsolate voices, and you cannot see the true reflection of the different opinions which the Chinese people can have in the conflict of China's economic career, because the media depends on the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party."
So he added, "one of the most popular newspapers in China had avoided the offer to publish his article," but he did not say what newspapers it was.
The Republicans debarred women's voters before the legislative elections with the debate of Kavanaugh, the analists have warned.
Because a lot of high Republicans are waiting, and they defend their candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanaugh in front of a number of members of the sexual profession, the analists have remarked that they will have a fall, especially among women, in the elections of the next legislative.
The emotions surrounding this subject have been very large, and most of the Republicans have been registered to show that they want to continue with their libation.
You can't go back on these things," he said to her about an article published on the Maxwell School of the University of Grant Reher Syrácyse on Saturday to The Hill.
Reher said he doubted that the pressure of the voters who are angry might be able to support Jeff Flake (R-Arietegree) an investigation of the FBI will be sufficient to calm down the pressure of the voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday," he said, "and they won't forget tomorrow, and not again in November," according to the national spokesman of Karine Jean-Pierre and the progressive team of MoveO, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, "It's November!" protested the protestors that the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee had decided to proceed on the appointment of Kavanaugh, although the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford was there, declared in Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivatement of the Demaccrats will be out of place," said Stu Rothenberg independent political analyte to the news website.
"People say it has been a great influence; that is true.
But it may still be more effective, especially between women and young men who have no fixed votes, between 18 and 29 years old, though they often don't vote for the President."
In spite of the public testimony against the Supreme Court candidate Ford described the details of sex, the analists suggested that it might be a downfall if the Republicans decided to go on with their confirmation.
"It has become a great trouble for the Republican Party," said Michael Steinl, the former President of the National Committee of the Republic, at the beginning of the week, according to the NBC News.
"It's not about the vote of the committee, whether you have to sit in the chair of the accused Kavanaugh or not, because the Republicans have managed this matter and how they treated her," he explained to the news conduit the director of the group who helps to choose Guy Cecil "Prities USA" by the democrat.
However, the Americans seem to be quite divided in time to decide which of them they believe between Ford and Kavanaugh, but it seems that a little more people do it for the second.
As one of YouGov's new poll shows that 41% of those who participated believed in Ford's testimony, and 35% certainly or probably Kavanaugh's.
Besides, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh probably lied in his statement, and 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is studying Ford's rentions at this moment, and at least what another accuser has done, which Deborah Ramirez has reported.
Last week, under oath to the Judial Committee of the Senate, Ford declared that he had been attacked by Kavanaugh when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court candidate showed him that they were at a party at Yale when they were students in the 1980s.
The guy who invented World Wellie's plan to start a new Internet against Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the one who invented World Well Web, wants to set up a startup that aims to face Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The last project on the technology legend is a company based on the Inruit, Berners-Lee's Free Software Platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which users will have access to this information.
In an exclusive conversation with Fat Company, Berners-Lee joked about the idea behind Inruit being "to take over the world."
'Now we must,' he said.
"It's an historic moment."
App uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data store or a POD.
Contacts list, to-dos list, calendar, music storage, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify-all available in a single browser, and all together.
This is an icon-specific identity of the online personal data storage that is fully bound to the user for a particular type of information that can be accessed from.
The company calls it "employment of humans by facts."
According to the executive director John Bruce, the idea behind Inruit is that the means, the processes, and the ability of making use of for all of us Solid.
Now, these are the companies that form a security platform that Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM bought for working on the project, a community of volunteers and volunteers who volunteered.
From this week forward, technology developers in the whole world would be able to create their own decorized apps using the tools available on the Inupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking about the need to make a complete change in Facebook and Google when their business patterns change completely from day to day.
"We are not asking for permission from them."
On Saturday, a post published by Berners-Lee wrote that "discriminating is the completeness and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee completely changed the Internet when he created the World Web Consortment of Massachusetts Instite of Technology.
For the last few months, Berners-Lee has been a very effective voice in arguing about neutrality on the network.
Even at the time when Irupt starts, Berners-Lee will remain the creator and director of the World Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Date Instite.
"I am a very optimist on the Internet about this next time," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: He's been sworn by the Victoria Cross of the First World War
They say that as a soldier of the first World War, he has been the only clergy of the Church of England who has received Victoria the Cross, 100 years later in his own country.
Lieutenant Bernard Vann won his prize on September 29th, 1918 at Bellenglise and Lehacourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and he never knew he had received the highest British reward of military honor.
A memory stone was displayed by his two grandchildren on a parade in Northhamptonshire on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a very symbolic one to reward his grandfather and show him 100 later.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Channel of Saint-Quentin, "that it was very locked and under the constant fire of cannons and machine-guns."
Then he hurried to the first line of fire, and with the greatest courage drove the line forward until he found a cannon alone and threw three of the detachments to the ground.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German tax collector on October 4th, 1918, a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, aged 72, said he knew that his grandfather's actions would never do them, but that was a great humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put a flower jar after the parade.
Michael Vann said, "It was a great honor for him to participate in the parade," and added, "that "the courage of a true hero proves the protection of many people."
MMA's fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but they put Peppa Pig instead.
Let's say you're up all night to see Bellator 206 full of people, and then they won't let you see the main show.
The sign of San Jose had 13 battles between six of the main calendar, and it was to be directly given in the United Kingdom at night, in the 5th chain of Channel.
At six o'clock in the morning, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the spectators of the United Kingdom were surprised when Peppa went to Pig.
Some of them were not surprised to fight deliberately after being awake until morning hours.
A follower described it as a bad joke for Twitter's children, a change for cartoons.
"A government law says that it wasn't proper for six o'clock in the morning, and they had to change their programming for the children," Dave Schwartz said, when they asked him about the performance.
"Peeppa pig, "yes."
President of the Bellator Company said Scott Coker is going to go through programming so that the audience in the United Kingdom will consider it in the future.
'I think when I think of repetition, I'm sure we can fix it,' said Hook.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning, and we can't fix that until we're Sunday, Monday at their own time.
But we're working to fix it.
Believe me, when the change was made, there were a lot of messages going on and on, and they were not all very pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government matter.
I promise the next time it won't happen again.
We're gonna put five fights instead of six, just like we usually do, and we tried to offer more to people, and we fucked up.
Unfortunately, it is a situation."
Drit Island Discs: Tom Daley for 'decision' for sex
The Olinpian Tom Daley said he was grown up by being despised by sex, but that gave him a motive to success.
The 24-year-old boy said he hadn't noticed until he went to high school, "all of them weren't like him."
When he spoke of the first Dwarf Island of the Four of Radio 4th, he said he had spoken to others about the homosexual rights.
Moreover, he said that being a parent was the cause of the Olympic game of winning less importance.
The usual program presenting, Kirsty Young, has taken several months' vacation due to illness.
After he appeared completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "dispensed" compared to all the others because society wouldn't allow him to like boys and girls.
He said, "So far, the feelings that make you feel despised and different from others have been true reasons for success and strength."
He wanted to prove that there was something in his words because he didn't want people to be disappointed when they heard about his sexuality.
The sportsman who won two medals in the Olympic games has become a great profile promoter LGTB, and he has taken part in the Commonwelth Games in Australia to ask for more countries to decelerate homosexuality.
He said he had given his opinion that he had a great deal of luck because he wanted to live in open form without being able to bear the consequences, and to give others hope.
Three times the world champion said he fell in love with a man. "Dustin Lance Black, the American filmmaker who knew him in 2013," "he got him by surprise."
Daley married the winner of a rainbow that's 20 years older than him last year, but she said the equality of years hasn't been a problem between them.
He said, "When you're so young and so much that's happened to you." "He went to Olympic games when you were 14 years old and your father died with cancer three years later," it's hard to find someone of the same age who's been through similar circumstances.
The couple became the parent of Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said his whole vision has changed.
"If you'd asked me about it, 'I'm going to win a gold medal' was the only thing I had in my head,' he said.
"And, you know, there are more important things than the gold medals in the Olympic games.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert.
Daley said that his father wouldn't accept that he was going to die, and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to the London games in 2012 because he wanted to be on the first line.
'I couldn't say, 'You won't be able to be in the first line, father,' he said.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing, and I didn't admit that she wasn't invincible until she died.
The next day Daley played Olympic games 2012 and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life-to stand before the public in the Olympic games-there was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired his first chance of singing -Proud, of Heather Small, who had made him feel himself identified throughout the whole action of preparing for Olympic games, and still gives him a hen's ass.

Mickelson, who wasn't in shape, sat down on Saturday at Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson's going to record on Sunday when he plays the 47th of Ryder Cup, but he's going to have to improve his form so he doesn't look bad.
He was breaking Mickelson's mark for two years playing the 12th act, but Captain Jim Fury sent him to his chair in Saturday's fourballs and the fashionable foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of action, as has often been in favor of the United States, he who has been champions five times, broke the day in order to be animated on one side and on the other side of the field, hoping to correct what makes him suffer.
Never was the directst of the drivers, not even in the best moments of his career, and the 48-year-old player is not the right choice for Le Golf National dynamics, because the toughest gamblers are the ones who are lost.
And even if the field itself doesn't scare enough, Mickelson, on the ninth game, on Sundays, will have to face the British Open champion, who joined Tommy Fleewood to win four games of this week.
If the Americans, when they start at 12 single-pointed games, have a good beginning, the Mickelson game might be quite crucial.
Fury trusted his man because he couldn't say much more.
"He understood very well the paper he had for today, knocked me on the back, and told me he would be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a top-end sporter and he's been through these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I expected more, but that's how it happened, and we felt like we had to act like this.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna get through Nick Faldo's record as a football player who's played the most of the Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
This may be the end of the professional route of Ryder Cup, which has never reached his individual mark again.
Mickelson has won 18 times, lost 18 times, and stopped within seven times, but according to Furyk, he has brought in something that cannot be touched.
"It makes him laugh, and he is sarcastic and clever. He is always joking with people, and it is wonderful to have his presence," he declared.
"Young people have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to see him.
He does a lot more than he can play."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great advantage of the European team can disappear immediately.
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of Europe, knows by experience how much advantage the last few days' round, even though Ryder Cup's tournament can be easily rendered uncomfortable.
In 1997, the Dane had taken Valder, where, under Seve Ballesteros, his team had five points of advantage over the Americans, but it was hard to win with the score 141⁄2 and 131⁄2.
"I always remind myself that we had a great advantage over Valder and that we had barely won, and that we had lost much advantage in Brooklin," Bjorn said (in the photograph), after we had won 5 and 3 on Friday and yesterday in Le Golf National.
So history tells us both of me and of all teammates that this isn't over yet.
We'll have a lot of courage tomorrow.
We'll go out into the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is determined until the points are on the board.
We aim to win the throne, and we'll focus on it.
As I've always said, I pay attention to 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the opposite side, one of the best players in the world."
With the achievements that his players have made on a difficult golf field, Bjorn said, "I don't ever want to get ahead of anything.
Tomorrow.
It's the individual's turn tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, each golfer has to prove his full capacity.
That's the message to be transmitted to the players: the best you've got out tomorrow.
Now, forget your colleagues, who must get out of their best."
Like Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other party thinks they're going to play better than one of his players, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three at four points.
Fury has been the same on both sides of these changes in the direction of the last day, as a member of the winning group of Brookline, and later on, lost against the European party, when the Europeans made "the wonder of Medina."
"I remember every word I said," he said, when we asked Ben Crenshaw how Ben was captain of 1999 encouraged the players the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to keep our advantage from the start, like Broochlin and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there's a lot of pressure in these intermediate games.
We've decided on that list of players, and we think we're going to do a great job tomorrow."
Thomas has a job to hire, and Rory McIlroy will be his last match, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and the other Europeans in the middle order.
"I have chosen this place in order, because they are in a position to make the whole way," said Bjorn about the individuals chosen by him.
They have delayed the construction of the new German warship again.
The new Marchian fair in Germany had to be requested in 2014 to replace the old warships at the time of the war, but it won't be built until the next year, because of the wrong systems and the cost, the local media says.
The request for a battleship called "Rheinland-Pfaz" (the chief bottle of new French fruitata in the World-Wuertmberg class) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, as Dee Zeit says, a military spokesman.
The ship had to be put into the navy in 2014, but a thousand problems that have been delivered have prevented this project of great ambition.
Marina 2007 will replace the four ships of Baden-Wuerttenmberg, the four different kinds of bottles of Bremen's type.
It seems that a powerful cannon, with features opposed to airships and missiles, and the technology for doing hidden actions (e.g. a restricted radar, and has infrared and acoustic signatures).
Besides, he will have longer capacity for maintenance-the latest fruit can be out of the original ports until two years.
However, for constant delays, these warships with presumptive technology (which are the object of Germany's projecting) will become old when they come into the service, says Die Zeit.
The year that F125 fragata has ended badly in your press, because the German army officially rejected the ship's request and returned to the Blohm & Voss fleet in Hamburg.
It was the first time that Marina had sent a ship back to the fleet after she had delivered it.
The reasons for translation are unknown, but the German media mentioned "software and hardware" seriously, and consequently the warship would be useless if it were to be used in combat requests.
It was especially important for them to be in software mistakes, with ships of the Bagen-Wuerttenmberg type, 120 sailors will operate, that is to say, half of them in the Bremen's class.
Besides, the boat has too much weight, so its performance is much reduced, and it's more difficult to add innovations to the future.
fleets of "Rheinland-Pfaz" to 7.0 tons weigh twice the same kinds of ships as Germany used in the Second World War.
Besides wrong hardware, the price of the whole project (including the training of manipulation) is also the problem.
He says he's arrived at $3.100 million from $2200 he'd have to cost at first.
The problems with new Fragatas are even more important in the warning of the power of the German marina.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Barels, leader of the German parliament, confessed that the "bleary ships" of the marina are being exhausted.
As the representative said, the problem increased more and more, because no substitute was given after the retreat of the old vessels.
He regretted that he hadn't even got into the garage a fruitata of the Worldttemberg class.
The National Trust has watched the secret life of the Bats.
A new investigation has been made on a land in Scotland to find out how bats use the landscape to look for food.
They're hoping to get more information about the behavior of these flying mammals so that the future the activities of protecting them can be better determined.
The research of scientists in the Irish National Trust (NTS) organization will follow the communal dwarf bats and sopranos, and also of the ear-heart and Daubent bats, in the gardens of the Wester Ross Invewe.
Special recorders will be placed in essential positions, and will follow the activities of bats all the time.
The U.S. health system (NHHS) workers in the United Kingdom will also make mobile probes with manual detectors.
When experts test all the recorders, the frequent number of bats will be known, as well as what each species does.
Then they'll be the map and the report of the habit of the bat to get a hollow landscape-scale image of the bat's behavior.
In the opinion of Rob Dware, the protector of the NTS, it is determined which are the most important fields for bats, and how each species uses them.
By this information, the advantages of the work of living are determined, e.g. the origin of meadows, and for bats and species related to them, as well as to preserve the forests.
The bat population of Scotland as well as of the United Kingdom made a striking impression on its decline.
They are threatened by construction and development, which affects the nests, and they lose their way of living.
Even the wind-turbins and lightnings bring danger, and the fly capture papers, chemical treatments, and domestic cats' attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
However, as they hunt at night, their ears are more useful to them than their eyes at the moment of plunder.
They use a fancy planting technique to detect bugs and obstacles on the flight road.
270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,0 acres of Scotland, are responsible for the NTS organization, and it takes bats seriously.
He has heard ten training experts, who make regular observations, the examinations of the nests, and sometimes rescues.
For the organization has created a bat-reservation in Scotland, first and only one in Scotland, on the land of Dumfries and Galloway, where eight bat species of Scotland live.
David Thompson, manager of the land, says land is a good land for them.
"We have an excellent religion for the Treava bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, and many years old trees; it is very proper to dwell in them.
Yet there are still many things unknown about bats, so we'll understand what they need to be healthy by the work we do here and on other lands."
Thompson has stated that it is very important to check whether there are bats before you do your job to preserve them; for, if you unwittingly destroy the one mother-sea, 400 single bats and young ones may die, and perhaps the whole population of the place might disappear.
Bats are a protected species, and it is illegal to kill them, to pursue or to disturb them, and to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the representative of the Bats' protection, has asked for assistance in the general population.
He said, "We still have to learn a lot about bats, and we don't know how many of the species live with us."
Ronan's accusations of rape have been rejected while his lawyers are hurrying to charge the German magazine.
The violation of violence against him has said that they are "superious novels," and that those who have done it want nothing but to "conceit" by their name.
Der Spiegel, who's reporting his lawyer, is preparing to report the German news-teller.
An American woman named Kathryn Mayorga was accused of raping in 2009 in Las Vegas.
After that, he thought he paid $375,000 for keeping it secret, as Der Spiegel said Friday.
In a few hours after the charge has been released, he's made a direct video of Instagram for 142 million followers on platform 33, where he said the accusations are false.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is false news," said the footballman who won the Gold Ball in front of the camera five times.
"They want to obtain publicity by using my name.
It's normal.
They're trying to get my name into fame, but that's what happens in my profession.
I am a happy man, and everything is fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel because of the accusations that "consistable publication on suspicion of privacy."
The lawyer Christian Schzaz said that the player will demand compensations as far as "the anguish of the act, which is one of the severest violations of personal rights in the past years."
The supposed event happened in June 2009 at a hotel and casino suite in Las Vegas.
After having met him in a night club, they thought they'd gone to Ronaldo and Mayorga Player's bedroom where he thought he'd been raped by the whip, as the documents in the Clark County document say.
Mayorga declared that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after supposed events, and that he was a good man in '99, but that he had missed 'one hundred.'
The documents say that Ronald confessed that he had had sexual intercourse, but that his relationship was allowed.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and took pictures of her wounds in the hospital, but later she arrived at an out-of-the-office agreement because the "Renciers were terribly afraid of her, and "because she was worried about being humiliated."
As the woman of 34 says, she wants to turn the deal back because she's still traumatized about the supposed incident.
When the supposed attack occurred, Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester Union to Real Madrid, and last summer he went to the great Italian Juve team, due to a deal of $ 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will regret "It will be" to lose self-creators.
The United States will cease to be the leader of self-creatures after "Brexit," as Greg Clark said.
He also said that Toyota UK has been told that the United Kingdom will stop the production of the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an arrangement," Clark said.
The Japanese car factory said that the delays which would be in the adamicated due to an uncorked "Brexit" would be the loss of the job.
The Burnaston factory, which manufactured the Auris and Avensis vehicles of Toyota, had nearly 150,000 cars in the last year, and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the United Kingdom leaves the United States without agreement at the end of March from the European Union, the production of our factory will be stopped," said the administrator of Toyota of Marvin Cook Burnaston.
Other auto manufacturers in the United Kingdom (like Honor, IMW, and Jaguar Land Rover) have also declared that they are afraid to know how trades will work without agreement from the European Union.
For instance, Brexit said he'd close his min factory for a month.
The main concern for car manufacturers is the risks about the supply chain, if you do the "Brexit" without a deal.
The production line of Toyota is "now current" and the pieces arrive every 37 minutes, either from the U.S., or from the manufacturers of the European Union, for cars created as they are asked.
If the United States leave the European Union without agreement on the 29th of March, it may be interrupted at the frontiers, and consequently delays and inactions.
It wouldn't be possible for Toyota to keep inventory more than a day in Derbyshire factory, so the production should be stopped.
In Clark's statement, the plan of Thesia May's "Chequers" for the future relations of the European Union is "has been measured to avoid such adhesive examination."
"It is necessary to have an agreement. We want the best arrangement, not just to make sure the current success is successful, but to make use of this option in the future," said BBC Radio in the Today program of 4 strings.
"In addition to Toyota, other manufacturers have shown that a series of successful supplies is indispensable."
Toyota can't explain how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run the competitiveness of the factory would be reduced by additional cost, and consequently he remarked that jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked for 24 years in Burnaston and said that the members are getting more and more concerned, "I'm sorry we won't get back these jobs if we lose them.
A government spokesman said, "We have proposed a definite and convincing plan for future relations with the European Union."
It's possible that the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein may be delayed again, in the White House.
The important meeting between Donald Tramp and General Rod Rosenstein might be "a week behind," while the conflict of the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh is going on, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is studying the work of a special consultant Robert Mueller, the influence of Russia in the elections of the United States, the connection between Trumpe's assistants and Russia, and he's looking at Mueller's supposed to be the president.
Trumpe has been talking about whether Mulle's independence will be compromised during the last few months in Washington.
In the past few months, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had considered taking a secret microphone to record his conversations with Tramp and removing the president from the post following the 25th of the Constitution of the United States.
Rosenstein has cancelled the information.
He went to the White House last Monday, however, while the reports were being fired that he would resign.
Instead, he declared that he would have a meeting with Trumpe, who was currently at the United Nations of New York, on Thursday.
Trump said he preferred not to fire Rosenstein, but then he's delayed to avoid a conflict with the commission of the judicial power of the Senate meeting; in this committee, one of the women who accused Kavanaugh and him to commit sex, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, was tested.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh, so the Senate's vote has been delayed.
This is Trumpe's press secretary Sarah Sanders showed up on the Fox News on Sunday.
When they asked him about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said, "It's not yet established; it may be this week, but I'd understand delay another week, considering all that's going on in the Supreme Court.
However, we shall see; I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters won't agree with that statement, because Sanders hasn't given a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
The anchorman Chris Wallace asked him why.
In Sanders' statement, the press conferences haven't been missing from the TV reporters, but he said, "I agree they're a big one."
Then he suggested that the direct relationship between Trumpe and the press will increase.
"The President makes many more attempts of questions than his predecessors," he said, and added without mentioning the evidence, "We've checked these statistics."
Mr. Sanders said they're going to continue to do the press conference, but if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that's much better than asking me.
We've been trying to do that a lot of times, and you've seen that we've done so many times in the past few weeks, and it'll replace the press conference when we can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he comes out of the White House, when he's parting in open sessions, or in the press conferences where dignataries are visited.
He doesn't do press conferences on his own.
This is the possible reason that the President of the United States has revealed this week in New York, when he made an escapaneous appearance in front of the journalists who were assembled there, and sometimes strangely.
The secretary of the union of the kingdom has written a letter to the workers of the European Union who work on the NHS system in Scotland, because of the concerns of "Brexit"
The secretary in the health department has written to the workers of the European Union who work in the NHS health system in Scotland, to thank them for the whole country, and to ask them to stay there after 'Brexit'.
That the United States are less than six months to get out of the European Union, Jeane Freeman, the Parliamentarys of Scotland.
The government of Scotland has already agreed to take the cost of serving the citizens of the European Union, because it is the "settled status" of the Union.
Freeman has said in his letter, "The negotiations about "Brexit" have progressed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and it is expected to have some decision for the fall.
Nevertheless, the government of the United States has increased preparations for a possible exit without commerce.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That's why I want to confirm that I appreciate the contribution of each worker, whatever his nationality.
The co-workers of the European union, including those out there, bring useful experiences and skills, and improve the health service for the benefit of patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is certainly your house, and we hope to live with us."
Christon Abercrombie has been operated with emergency after a wound has been hit on the head.
Christon Abercrombie Tense of State Tigers has been actively operated on their heads after having suffered a wound on Saturday after losing 31 and 27 on Saturday against the Vanderbilit Commodores, as Mike of Tennes reports.
In the words of Rod Reed Tennese State main coach, the player has suffered his head a little before the half of the game rest.
"He rolled up the sideband and fainted," Reed said.
The coach and the medical guys put oxygen in the band and took it in a bed for a deeper medical examination.
A representative of Tennessee State State has told Chris Harris of the WSMV network that he's out of the operation and he's in the medical centre of Vanderbilt.
Harris said, "They haven't hurt the type of wound or the details about his anxiety" and they're trying to determine when the wound happened in the Tennessee State team.
He's been in his second year with his red shirt Abercrombies, and he's got his first time in Tennessee State Group after transfering it from Illinois.
He made five plates on Saturday before he left the game, he made 18 plates all the time.
Strange buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the earl when they buy benefits in the United Kingdom.
The foreign buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the earl when they buy benefits in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to help those who have no home, according to the plans of the conservative party.
This strategy is intended to neutralize the success of Corbyn's young voter.
For those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, it will be the increase of the tax on the tinbrae.
If they think of the public treasure, they'll collect 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless.
Strange buyers will have to pay a higher tax on the earl when they buy benefits in the United Kingdom, and it will be used to help those who have no home, as Theresa May said today.
This strategy is intended to neutralize the success which Corbyn's young voter has made, and Corbyn has promised to give more taxes to those who have reasonable prices, and to those who have the most income.
In the United States it will be for persons and companies who do not pay taxes, the increase of the tax due above the inkbrae, and the government will use it for the attempts to reduce the people who sleep in the street.
Overload, which is an addition to the tax on the current earl (including the higher taxes for the second houses and rentals purchased for two years) may be made up to three per cent.
If they think of the public treasure, they'll collect 120 million pounds a year.
It is calculated that in London they buy from those who do not live in the 13th Kingdom, and consequently the prices are increased, and it is more difficult for those who desire to buy it for the first time to enter into the housing market.
The rich parts of the country, especially those of the capital, have become "memuds"; for foreign buyers have spent most of their time outside the city.
In order to help the young people buy their first apartment, this new policy is just after Boris Johnson has asked them to reduce the tax on the inkbrae.
He has been charged by May to keep up the prices of benefits without buying them and not using them, and he has asked her to give up the price of the housing in Great Britain for repairing the "homes of the Great Britain."
Corbyn, on the other hand, has introduced attractive reforms around the housing, including the control of rents and the homeless homeless homeless.
Besides, the council wants to give more power to build more housing.
May said, "I was going to spend my presidentship in the first dream last year, to improve the life of each new generation.
That means repairing the rotten housing trade.
The gates of Britain will always be open to those who want to work and organize their lives.
However, to be as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and as for the British inhabitants who work hard for foreign companies as to buy housing is not fair.
For too many people, the dream of being master of a flat has gone too far, and the dignity of those who are to sleep in the street is still here.'
Jack Ross, "To be coaching in Escence Group" is my greatest wish.
The head of Jack Ross Sunderland says that he's the greatest of his "gentletics" one day to be coach of the Scottish team.
The Scotsman of 42 is enjoying the challenge of reviving the northeast club, the third place in League One, from the first place to three points.
This summer came to Stadium of Light for the season after the return of St. Mir to Premiership in Scotland.
"I wanted to act as a gambler for my country.
"I won a Liga's trophy, and that was all," said Ross on the BBC Scotland Sportsund program.
"But since I was a little boy, I saw Scotland games with my father Hampden, and I have always wanted to go back.
Yet I had only the chance of managing the club."
Before Ross, among those who have been coaching Sunderland, there are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Canio.
The ex-master of Allo Atláltic had said that he had no anxiety for coming after so great a name, for Barnsley and Ipswich Town had declined the offer of training.
I'll have to ask myself, "Can I bring the club back to Premier Leguere?"
Considering the structure and installation of the club, he must certainly be at Premier Leguee," he said.
"It won't be easy to get there, but I won't see myself as a success if I don't succeed."
Only three years ago Ross has been coaching him, as an assistant of Dubarton's boss, and one of Hearts for 15 months.
Then he helped Allo get back to the third grade, and thanks to him, the next time he was on his way down St. Mir's level, he was a champion.
Ross says he's more comfortable now with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falconerk, St. Mir and Hamilton Academical groups.
"It was a real crossway for me, perhaps," he said, "to take care of Allo.
"I really thought it was the best function for me to be coaching, rather than to be a gambler.
It's funny to say that, because I was a good player, I made a good living, and I lived on some important occasions of fame.
But playing can be hard.
You have to take a lot of things every week.
I still have to bear the stress and pressure of my work, but I'm happy to be a coach.
I always wanted to be coaching, and now that I'm doing that, I feel more comfortable on my skin than ever."
The whole interview will be given on September 30 (igandia) at Radio Scotland Station Sportsund, between 12 and 13:00 (BST)
Five-thirty Saturdays is the best time for a drink, according to an poll.
Thanks to the summer heat season, many have gone up Britain's public revenues, but pressure has increased for restaurant chains.
The sale of pubs and pubs has gone up from 2,7 per cent, but the restaurants have gone down four percent.8%, the data says.
Peter Martin, who has collected data from the CGA Company, says, "Because the sun has played all the time, and England's team has lasted more than he thought at the World Football contest, the July data is similar to those in June, where the public revenues have been raised by 2,8 percent, but the restaurants have gone down even more.
Even if the sales of the restaurant's June are down 1,8, they've been even worse in July.
The pubs and bars that specialize in liquors have had a much better performance, and their promotion has been greater than the descent of the restaurants' departments.
The publics who specialize in food have suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Apparently, people just want a drink.
Pub and bars's liquor sales have gone up six per cent in the last month, but the foods have gone down three per cent."
Paul Newman, who is a freeman of RSM and a hostage, said, "These are the results of the tendency we have seen since the end of the April.
The weather and social and sporting events are the most important factors in business outside home.
It's no wonder the restaurant chains are financial embarrassments, and the fact that a percentage of the sales is down to four, eight years from down, will cause serious damage, besides the continued pressures on the cost.
Long and hot summer comes in an unhappily season for the specialisations of food, and it is to be seen that moderate temperatures in August will give them comfort."
The increase of pubes and restaurants, including the establishments which have just been opened, has been of about 2,7 per cent in July, where the extent of the chains has been slowed down.
The Coffin Peach Tracker index watches the sales in the sector as far as the pubs, bars, and restaurants in the United Kingdom, having collected and analysed data from the 47 operator team. These operators have income entries more than 9,0 million pounds. This index is considered on the area reference point.
One of the five children has accounts that they hide from their parents in social networks.
One of the five children, some as young as 11, has accounts on social networks that hide them from parents and teachers, according to an incest.
In a high school industry of 20,000 students, you can see that "Spirits of Instagram" have gone up.
Because of this news, the fear of publishing sexual content increases.
Twenty percent of the students say they've got a "weasi" about what their parents can see.
But one of the five children, some as young as 11, has accounts on social networks that hide them from grown-ups.
In a high-school poll of 20,000 students, you could see that there were a lot of "Instagram false accounts" (the photo sharing website is Instagram).
Because of this news, the fear of being published sexual content increases.
Twenty percent of the students say they've got a clean "gents," which their parents can see, but they have private matters too.
A mother found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, where one of the teenagers used to call the others "Deep me."
This investigation of Digital Awarenes UKs and independent schools in the United Kingdom has been solved by 40 percent of 11 years old, and half of them acknowledge that they have private matters.
Mike Bucanan in HMC says, "It's funny that teenagers are tempted to produce secret outer space, which parents and teachers can't find."
Eilidh Doyle is the voicepiece of the athletes in Scotland.
Eilidh Doyle, in the general assembly of this year of the administrationship, has been appointed an ex-celesive director of the Komantism of Scotland.
Doyle is the prized athlete of Scotland, and the Director Ian Beatitie has said with this change that they have an excellent opportunity for the great experience of her in the last decade of nations.
"Eilidhe has a terrible respect for the community of society, of the United Kingdom, and of the whole world, and we know that it will be of great use to the Scotism of Scotland to be on the committee," said Beatit.
Doyle said, "I like it very much to be an athlete's spokesman, and I hope I'll make a big contribution and guide the sport in Scotland."
The US won 200 and 400 meters races at the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996, and it's got four gold medals all over it.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had an infection.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was time to see whether I'd recover or not, or how far.
I've had to walk again, and I've been doing my best to-day!
Thank you for the messages you sent me to cheer you up!"
There's a commercial ad of milk that my mother compares with cows that's going on the Internet.
A milking company created opposite opinions on the Internet compared to the milking cows.
The Elvise company, who's supposed to be a "the first silent milking laptop" in the world, has evoked a comic advertisement inspired in a music video to show the freedom that new devices give to the mothers who draw milk.
"Yes, I milk myself, but I don't stick it up," and "Maybe you haven't noticed it, but these aren't the tools, they're my tits."
The fool says, "Take milk, draw milk, give milk to the little ones, draw milk out, draw milk, I milk, I milk my girls!"
However, this announcement that the company has published on Facebook has created a discussion on the Internet.
With over 77.000 visits and hundreds of comments, video reactions have been produced in the audience. Many have said that it does not take seriously the "float" of the milk industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to make publicity for this product.
Like us, they must also be pregnant and given birth to milk, but they steal their young from them for a few days after they are born," said a user.
Elvis can be entered discreetly into one of the milking bras (Elve/Mother)
Someone else said, "Very traumatic, of course, for mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to make the publicity of a mother's milkling for the mothers?"
Another said, "This news doesn't have any attention."
Others, however, have defended the ad, and a woman has confessed to him that it seemed to her "to burst with laughter."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I still gave up my chest, I'd buy one.
When I took my milk, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but that's the end of it.
It's a great product," a user wrote.
Another commented, "It's a funny story, directed to mothers who draw milk (they've often got to do it in their work-places or in their bathrooms), because they feel as if they were "kids."
He does not intend to praise or judge the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they've been dancing with milk on their chests.
A lot of women who draw milk are considered to feel like cows in the campaign.
Elvise's milk is very quiet, but she doesn't have a wire or a pipe. One of the washing bras can be carried discreetly, so that women can move as they please, be little children in arms or get out of the street.
Ana Balarin Mother's partner and the executive director of the founder commented, "Elvie is a revolutionary product, and so he demanded a bold and profitable introduction.
With this contrast between the women who draw milk and milk, we wanted to make out the process of milk and all its challenges, and to express in an entertaining and immediate manner the freedom of the milking.
It's not the first time Elvis's milk recording has attracted attention.
In London, a mother with two children passed by while Martha Jakubowski, the designer, used the product.
Hundreds of child migrators have been taken to a camper's camp at the border of Texas.
The number of emigators of the emigrated children has lately increased greatly, though they have been more or less the same watch on the frontier, one of these reasons is, because it has been more difficult to carry children to protect their protectors because of the rhetoric and strict instructions of the Trumpe's administration.
So far, most unpapered immigants have been their protectors themselves, but now they're afraid they're called to protect their children, because they might lose their ability to stay in the United States.
The danger increased in June; for the Federal authorities claimed that those who wanted to be protectors and the other adults who lived in their homes should send fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigation authority.
Last week Matthew Albenc, one of the U.S. immigrations and adan security officers, declared before the Congress, that they had been arrested by dozens of people who had made a demand to protect the minors who had not arrived at their age.
This agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of them had no criminal precedents.
"There are nearly 80 percent hairs of those who dwell in our country, or those who live with them, and many of them are criminal strangers.
So we're still catching them," said Albac.
To process the situation of children more rapidly, the officers have created new rules, according to which, after catching children, they must be found in the court in a month's time, and not in the course of sixty days, as before, in the words of the workers of the refugees.
Many of them will appear during a video conference call, asking an immigration judge for legal status.
If we decide not to get help, they'll be deported at once.
The more time the children are in the watch centers, the more chance is there to increase their anxiety and depression, so that violent fits or attempts to escape might occur, according to reports made in the system for refuge workers and the last few months.
The defenders of the children say that these uneasinesses are increased in great buildings like Tornillo; for, as it is so great, it is more likely that they should not see the affairs of children.
They also said that if the children are taken to the camper shop camping without having time to prepare emotionally or say good-bye to their friends, the trauma they have already increased.
Syria has asked the U.S., France and Turkey to leave immediately.
In the general assembly of the United Nations, the minister of foreign affairs, Walid al-Mooam, has also called back to his homes, though the war of the country was in his eighth year.
Moulumle, who is also the substitute for the Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the land of Syria, under pretence of fighting against terrorism, and that they will treat him as "deeds."
"They must get out of the country at once and without any condition," he said.
Moulumle said war was almost over against the "terrorism" of Syria; 360,000 people have died in this war since 2011, and millions have been obliged to leave their homes.
She said that Damascus will continue to fight in the sacred battle until we clean all the territory of Syria and from the terrorist groups and from "unlaw to foreign presence."
The United States has 2,000 soldiers in Syria, especially those who are fighting President Bashar Al-Assad, who train and advise the Arabs of Syria.
France has 1,000 soldiers in the country where the war has destroyed.
In regard to the subject of the Refunx, Moulum has said that there is a right condition for them to return, and has attributed them to certain "west countries" to the disreputable fear which urges them to remain outside.
"We call the international community and humanitarian institutions to allow them to come," he said.
"They're loving what's just humanitarian."
The United States of America and the European Union have remarked that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until Assad and opposition come to a political agreement for the end of the war.
In recent times Russia and Turkey have made a agreement in creating a refuge in the last citadel of the rebels in Idliben;
This agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a great scale attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Mouumle said that the deal had purely "limit" agreements, and declared that the military action would have jihads in view, including the fighters of Nusa, related to Al-Qaeda, who would be "defected."
The courier of Staffan de Mistua, a nation of the United States, expects that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be made among the members of the Government and of the opposition, to begin to form a constitution after the war, as well as to open the way to elections.
Moqualem has established certain conditions for the administration of Syria to participate in this assembly, saying that the work of the assembly ought to be limited to the reconnaissance of the present constitution, and to observe that no one else ought to be involved.
Why Trumpe wins for the second time
After this logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, if (as many of the democratic audiences have probably expected) a process of detention or scandal does not end before his preamble.
That would be the most dramatic end of a preside.
For now, the audience doesn't seem tired.
From 2014, the spectator of the majority of audiences in CNN has almost doubled until 1,05 million viewers have been reached, and the MSNBC chain threefolded until 1,6 million.
Fox News has, on his side, 2,4 million audiences in that schedule, i.e. 1,7 million has gone up from four years ago according to Niels' company. The "The Rachel Madow Show" in the MSNBC chain has got the biggest television viewer on the cable line, and has got it until 3,5 million viewers on the night of important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people, because we want to understand what's going on," says Neal Baer, running the "Designed survovor" show in the ABC network, and after having destroyed the Capitol, it's about a president's show.
"Just the Funny Parst: And a Few Hard Truths About Singing Into the Hollywood Boys Club" (only ridiculous Zatis, the hard truth about entering the Hollywood multilen Club) has another theory.
Before the 2016 elections, he was in a Boston cab,
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
"They say he made her laugh," said Scnovell.
There's also time for entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, like nothing else on television, the stories that come from Washington are the future of the law ofbduction, the families of the immigants can regroup, and they decide the health of the social economy.
Only high-voiced audiences have the chance to disconnect it.
However, it goes beyond being informed that if you spend six hours watching a debate of experts about a variety of subjects, Bob Woodward used "severentgers" to write the "Fear" book, Paul Manafort's $15,000-dollar ostrich jacket ("the suit of ruins" in the text of The Washington Post), and that is a funny way to describe the "Stomic" in Trumper.
At least I won't look at Super Mario in the same way again.
Weelhouse Theaternation Director and the "Pawn Stars" program Brent Montgomery says to the character and variable arguments of Trumpe's show (to argue with the national protbol-liga, to raise Kim Jong-un) "'Reality show's sense of being a "Reality show" which gives you something to consume every day."
You can't lose any parts, or you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleisse this week, she made 26 degrees, and she was sunny in her house on the north coast of Kaulia, but she was in the house watching MSNBC recording CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the television, especially now, that Brett Kavanaugh is to be shown in front of the commission of the judicial power of the Senate, and that the future of the Supreme Court is suspended.
"When I used to do those funny TVs, people used to say it was the end of Western civilization," Fleisse told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but apparently they were right."

The foreign money is entering the bar for half-legal elections of the U.S. Congress.
It is no wonder that in the course of the seventeenth of Pennsylvania money is entering the bar, for the Congress-distributionals are reorganized, and consequently two headlines are fighting for the same chairs.
The frontiers represent the Conor Lamb of the Democrats in this distraction around Pittsburgh which has recently been reorganized by the frontiers, each man got his chair in the special elections of another distraction.
He has another lieutenant, indeed, in the Republican Party, Keith Rothfus, who represents the 12th division of Pennsylvania, which is displayed by the distraction of 17.
In January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the limits of the distractions were handled against the constitution for the Republicans.
17. This new distraction contest has caused a close competition for the finances of the campaigns in the main sources of the parties: the representative of the democratic campaign (DCCC) and the national Committee of the Republican campaign (NRCC).
It became a well-known name Lamb for a few in Pennsylvania that he won the special elections in the 18th of Pennsylvania, Congress-distributional.
It was a Republican's chair in the last decade, and President Donald Tramp won the distraction with 20-point advantages.
In political speeches, Democrats have a little advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for being on the side of China, but then he's decided back.
The diplomats have declared that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, that Washington has hardly asked them to turn back.
Trumpe had a polite meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until the partners decided to put out the crew of Trump organisation.
The officers of the State Department decided to leave El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, according to the new resolutions to leave Taiwan, as Heather Nauerte, the spokesman of the department, said in a month's initial statement.
However, the punishment was considered to be only against El Salvador, which received 140 million as aid from the United States in 2017, including the control of the drug traffic, to promote development and aid in economy.
Among the penalties proposed, there are certain restrictions and specific viscissitudes of economic aid, which would be highly injurious to the country of Central America, because of its vast rate of unemployment and murder.
As the inner meetings progressed, the officers of North America and Central America delayed a superior conference of security and economic prosperity, which was intended to be descended from a similar meeting in the past year, and the immigation of the immigants was considered an advance in order to prevent the United States from going to the United States.
But in the middle of September, the principal officers of the administration made it clear that they wanted to make a conference, so they declared that the treatment of El Salvador was cancelled.
Vice President Mike Pence is expecting to join the conference that has changed in the middle of October, a sign of the importance of the administration to the meeting, as the diplomats say.
The three American envoys returned secretly to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic, without a message or a severe punishment from Washinto.
A spokesman from the White House of Bolton refused to make any statement about the details given by the three American officers about the discussion.
It was confirmed by an anarchist who has been closely connected with the administration, and who has spoken anonymously.

It will soon be released from the report of Judge Robert Mueller, which will indicate whether Trumpe had interfered with justice; for there are many proofs of it in the public point of view.
Besides, Russia is also investigating whether Trumpe's campaign had been a friend of the American elections.
If the majority of Congress change their party, Trumpe will have to give them an explanation, as long as he is prepared to appear in front of the voters (and, if need be, at some future time under the oath of his equals).
There are many conditions, however, and I don't mean to say that Trump's ineluctable decline was del, or that of the European equivalents of Tramp.
We must make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and according to them the length of the conflict will be determined.
In 1938, the German officers were willing to strike Hitler, if the Western countries had held it up and helped the Czechs of Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the slaughter of the years after that.
We have history filled with such points of inflexion, which excite or retard the accidental progress of democracy.
The Americans are facing so many inflexium points right now.
What do we do if Trumpe fires Rod Rosenstein, the general prosecutor, is Roseinsten, who controls what's going to happen with Muller's research.
Rosenstein's job has been in danger since last year's announcement, that he suggested to the President to be secretly recording it, and that the President declared that it was inappropriate for his office.
Rosenstein says that what The Times said isn't correct.
"How can we answer if the entire investigation that Brett Kavanaugh has just been asked about is not fair, or if he receives confirmation of being a judge of the Supreme Court, even though against him there has been some convincing accusations of sex and of false testimony?
And above all, do we vote for a Congress that will require responsibility for Trumpe in the Mid-leg elections?
If we do not exceed these trials, it will be a red winter for democracy.

Graham Dorans of the Rangers feels positive in front of the competition against Rapid Vienne
Rapid Vienne will be the host of the Rangers Thursday, and they know that if the Austrians are defeated, they will remain in an excellent position to co-operation in Europe's team after a few weeks ago with Villarreal in Spain.
By a lession of Graham Dorans on his knee, he couldn't make his first appearance with Villarreal until he's drawn 2 and 2, but he thinks the Rangers can use it as a trap for better things.
"It was a good idea, because it's a good enemy Villarreal," said the 31-year-old player.
"We did something we wanted to do, and we ended up making a point.
Maybe we could have won the end, but the draw is a fair result, if necessary.
In the first half they prevailed, and in the second we reigned.
Thursday night will be very important for the European championship.
We hope to get three points, but it'll be difficult, because they've been good at the last game, but the audience are on our side, and I think we're going to make a positive result.
Last year was difficult, I had lesions, and they changed in the club itself, but it's just a positive atmosphere.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun, and training is good too.
I hope we will go on, forget the past season, and succeed."
Women are terribly worried about a problem with the savings of their retirement.
The members of the Inkes knew what care they would be, but very few have informed their members of the family.
Half of the people who participated in Nationwide's research said he'd talked to his partner about the cost of taking long-term care.
Only 10 percent has talked about it with his children.
"We want some member of the family to wait for us, but we don't dare ask," Holly Snyder explained, the vice presidential president of the Nationalwick insurance firm.
Here's the first step.
Talk to your husband or wife and children, the family won't be willing to take care of you unless you ask them first.
In association with advisor and family, in order to agree that you want to take care of it; for the cost of custody will depend on these occasions.
Ask a counselor to help you find a way to pay for it.
There's more than one chance of funding long-term security, among others, a hybrid insurance that can afford to pay the expenses of the guard in cash, and then you've got that money.
Clear legal documents. Forget legal conflicts.
Choose a reliable person to take care of your health, and also make sure that you will be properly guarded by the professionals if you are not able to demand it.
You also ask a lawyer to take care of your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial options on your behalf and, when you're not able to do that, to make sure that you pay bills.
Don't forget the details, let's say your parents are older and one of them has a medical situation and he's on his way to the hospital.

A man was shot with an air gun in Ilfracomben
They shot a man with an air gun when he went out at the party and was coming home.
The victim was 40 years old, and in Iphracombe (Devon) was in the Oxford Grove field when he was shot in his belly and in his hand.
The police described the shooting as "auguistic", which took place in the direction of 02:30 (the summer hour of the United Kingdom).
The victim did not see the attacker.
There's no serious injuries, but the police have asked for help from the testimony.
Earthquartles and tsunamis Indonesian
At least 384 people have died on Friday because of the earthquake and the strong tsunami that the Indonesian Palu city experienced, and, as the agents say, the number of the dead will rise.
Because communication systems are restricted, the field agents could not obtain information from the government Donggala, which is the area near the epizentro of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, north of Palu.
Palun, more than 16,0 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
This is the city of Palu on Sulawes and the important information about the government of Donggala:
It is the capital of the province of Central Palu Sulawes, and it is situated at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi, about 379800 inhabitants in 2017.
When the earthquakes and tsunamis were over, the town was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
The Donggala, on the other hand, is a government which takes a range of 300 miles more than forty miles to the north-west coast of Sulawesi.
The government, which depends on the province, had 299200 inhabitants in the 2017.
The economy of the province of Sulawesis is founded on fishing and farming, especially in the shores of Donggala.
It's also important that theping miners are in the province, but Marowalin's mostly focusing on the other side of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian table (Indonesian National Board for Diester Management), Paluk and Donggal have suffered a lot of tsunamis for the last 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died, hundreds of houses were destroyed by a tsunami in Dongga.
In 1996, another tsunami happened on the west side of Donggal, and nine people died.
In Indonesia it is placed in a sismic region called "Pazific fire belt," for which reason it often endures earthquakes.
These are the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: on December 26, there was a great earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province, north of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami.
2005: Between the end of March and the beginning of April, there were so many mighty earthquakes on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the Island of Nias near the Sumatra coast.
There was an earthquake of 6:8 magnitude in the South of Java (the island with the largest inhabitants in Indonesia), and it caused a tsunami.
There was an earthquake of 7:6 magnitude near the city of Padang, the capital of the Southern Sumara province.
More than 1,300 people died.
There was an earthquake of 7:5 magnitude in one of the Mentatwai islands near Sumtra, and it caused a tsunami of about 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and died of about 300 people.
2016. A small earthquake occurred in the government of Pidie Jaya of Acehea, and brought disaster and fear, because people remembered the destruction of the earthquakes and deadly tsunamis in 2004.
There were no tsunamis then, but more than 100 people died crushed by buildings.
2018: Some great earthquakes occurred among tourists on the island of Lombo in Indonesia, so well known, and more than 500 people died, especially in the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were left out for a while.

He has also been accused of a slight B-level crime which may be punished with a day's prison sentence and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin's accused of any crime.
In December 2017, his father, Todd Palin, was accused of attacking him.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police for supposed attack.
At this moment, the case is in the hands of the superior court of Alaska.
In January 2016, an assault on the house, was charged with incendiation of a domestic violence, and being drunk they accused him of being a weapon.
The girl's friend announced that she had an extreme blow at him.

Indonesia an earthquake tsunemia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died on Friday after an earthquake shook the island of Sulaws in Indonesia.
The earthquake of 7.5 magnitude created a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and communications are interrupted, and the number of dead will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake shook Sulawesi's centre, which is the capital of Indonesia on the northeast of Jakart.
In social networks, there are some tapes that show the moment of impact.
In fact, on account of a beach festival in Palu, there were hundreds of people there when the tsunami shook the coast.
Federal prosecutor wants a special death penalty for the suspects of the terrorist attack on New York.
The Federal prosecutor of New York wants to be put to death by eight people who died to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, the last time a punishment for a federal crime was established in the state.
It was supposed that Saipov, about 30 years old, used a rental truck from Home Depot to attack on the red road of the West Manhattan West Highway Avenue, which led all footmen and bikers ahead of him.
The prosecutor will have to prove that Saipov had killed those eight people, and that several people were seriously injured by "will" according to the intention of the death penalty presented in the South of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible to put a capital punishment in two cases.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury had charged Sypov 22 cases, including eight murders for organized crime, which the Federal prosecutor is accustomed to use in cases of organized crime, and a means of violence and destruction by motor-car.
The prosecutor said that the attack had to be "presumed and planned" because Syipov had "crudied" it, so he described it.
"Sayfullo Habullaevic Saipov's actions caused wounds, damages, and losses to these people's families and friends, Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Princes, Ann-ure Decadt, Darren's Drake, Arel Erlij, Hernan Fuporchi, Heran Diego Mendoza, and Alekinan Dgnuco, according to the intention.
Five of the victims' tourists were Argentines.
There's been a dozen of the last time the South District of New York tried a case of death.
Then Khalid Barnes was charged with murder for two drug providers, but at last in September 2009 he was sentenced to life.
The last time in a federal case in New York was capitalized in 1953, Junius and Ethel Rosenberg, to whom, during the cold war two years before, they were accused of a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union.
Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Sypov Uzbekist had not shown any rent during the days and months after the attack.
The police said he didn't feel bad about what he'd done.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he had seen the video of the ISIS organization in motion to attack the attack.
The police also asked him to put a flag on the ISIS institution in the hospital room.
As to the accusation of 22 crimes, he declared himself innocent.
David Patton, who is one of the Federal defenders who are engaged in representing Sypov, said that they have taken a great part in the prosecution's decision.
"We believe," Patton said, "that instead of accepting the guilt of a life sentence without a chance to release it, the decision to demand capital punishment will only extend trauma to people who have experienced these events."
Saipov's defense group asked the prosecutor not to ask for a death penalty first.
A member of the Conservative Party says NIGEL FARAGE should take care of the negotiations around Brexit.
Nigel Farage has promised "to cut people's army" in protest on the conference of the Conservative Party today.
The former leader of the P.P.S. has said that the politicians must feel hot, and Thesia May's parliamentarians have proposed it to take care of EB's negotiations.
Mr. Peter Bonamentary has been explained by the Conservatory subservatives by the members of Birmingham march, when the United Kingdom was already Mr. Farage's secretary of Brexit.
But the curators of the stay have arranged a protest against Brexit in the city, and Mrs. May's challenge was marked out: it's completely separated to make peace again.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep Chequers' plan going on, but he's in the middle of the Brexit's support and the EB's attacks.
The Allies believe that he will go on, and that he will try to make a deal with Brussels apart from such reactions, and that he will force the eurosceptics and farmers to decide between his offer and his "casa."
Mr. Bone was at Solihull, who explained to them that the member of the Leave Maans Leave was in the march party, he wanted us to fire Cheequers.
In like manner, he declared that he ought to be at work with Mr. Farage, and that he ought to take care of the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was armed, we'd be out already," he said.
The parliamentary Party of Wellingborough added, "I will defend Brexit, but we must fire Chequers."
He declared a rival with EB, and said, "We did not fight in war to serve anyone.
We want to make our laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected that public opinion had changed since the vote of 2016: "The British have changed their minds and they want to stop."
And Mrs. Jenkys, a member of the personal party and one of the Brexits, went to the march, and explained to the correspondents, "I'm just saying, Mrs. Prime Minister, listen to the public.
"Chequers is not known among the people, the opposition will not vote for him; he is not known among our fellow-citizens, nor among our Activists who shake the streets, and make us win elections.
"Let me hear it, Cherquers."
To Mrs May's, he added, "First ministers, to continue their work, must keep their word.
Mr. Farage said to those who participated in the demonstration, "to make the politicians feel hot," if they are going to betray the decision they had taken in the 2016 residental.
"Now this is a matter of confidence between our (people) and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray him, and we're here today, so they know we won't let him out with theirs."
Turning to the public filled with enthusiasm, he added, "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class, which is about to betray him.
"We are changing the army of the people who had won us at the east, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom becomes independent and autonomous and proud."
Meanwhile, the people who had to stay went through Birmingham before two hours of march in the centre of the town.
There were a few audiences who got up against Brexit's sign after this weekend's team meeting.
Adonis, a peasant member, laughed at the curators on account of the security problems they had with the party at first.
"These are the people who IKT sisstem tells us that they can get to work properly," he added, "and in Ireland the total technology of Canada plus plus plus, of no limit, of free free trade."
"It's a lie.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren's going to study "Very much" the opportunity of being president.
Elizabeth Warren's American senator says he's going to study "very much" after the November elections for president.
The Boston Globe's papers were reported by the Democrats of Massachusetts on Saturday, at the full meeting in the West Town Hall of Massachusetts, where he spoke of his future.
Warren, who is often criticizing President Donald Tramp, will be candidate to be reelected in November, against Geoff Diehl, the Republican Party, who was the vice president of the campaign at Massachitts 2016 Diel Tramp.
Well, as I'm saying, it's possible to take Trump's place in 2020.
It was the 36th day after the incident at Holyoke on Saturday afternoon that Trump took charge of his colleagues as an entire council meeting in the town hall.
A member of the party asked him if he meant to be president.
Warren replied that it was time for a woman to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and for that reason a woman must be in charge."
A suspect was arrested for the shooting which caused the death of Sims of the State of Louisa.
The police reported on Saturday that he had arrested a suspect on Friday on account of the shooting which caused the death of Wayde the son of Simbaloi in the University of Louisa.
The Baton Rouge Police Department at 11:00 (east hour) reported in the news conference at the 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson arrest.
Before he opened the Friday shooting video, asking for help to identify a man in it.

He was questioned by Simpson, and admitted that he had been there, had a gun in his hand, and had shot Wayde Sims.
He was arrested and taken to the Department of Police Department in the parish of Baton Rouge in the East jail without any incidents.

Russian Grand Prix race by Lewis Hamilton got the title of the world after winning Sebastian Vettel
It was clear that since he had classed Valtte Bottas Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, the orders of the Mercedes team would be living or killed.
From the start, Bottas was fine, and nearly threw Hamilton into the street at the first two of them to defend his place, and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel first entered the boxes, and Hamilton had to get into the field's end traffic, which ought to have been a direct influence on the race.
A turn of Mercedes came into the boxes later, and followed Vettel, but after a contest Hamilton got ahead of him, for in the combat the inner part of the Ferrari had been released after a double movement of defending the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started the race in the final row of the exit park, and finished the first round in the seventh place.
Next, he remained in the first place in a large part of the race, and, for the end, held the pneumatics to finish the race quickly, and to get Kim to run on Raikkon and get the fourth place.
At last he entered the box on the 44th, but he was unable to live the rhythm at eight o'clock, and Raikkon got the fourth place.
It's not an easy day, Valtteri's done a great job for the weekend, and he's really been honest.
"The party has done a great job," said Hamilton.
They were inaccurate.
President Donald Tramp laughed at Senator Dianne Finstein during a visit on Saturday, a demonstration that Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assaults by Christine Blasey Ford's letter.
Virginia was celebrated in the West when she spoke of a demonstration, the President did not give a direct reference to the testimony given by Ford to the Judial Committee of the Senate, but instead he said that everyone in the Senate shows that people are "bad, false, and lying."
"The only thing that can happen, and what is going on in the Senate for the last few days, is that you see people angry, that you see that people are evil, false, and lying," he said.
"Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember his answer? Did you leak the letter?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak it," he added, imitating the senator's reaction.
A letter which explains the details of the rents against Kavanaugh went in July to Feinstein, and he leaked in the September last time, but Finstein denied the leak that it had happened in his office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's argument; I haven't leaked his story," Feinstein explained to the committee, as the "The Hill paper has told me."
"She asked me to keep her quiet, and I kept her silent, as she had asked me to."
But the fact that he refused was not welcome to the President's side, who announced that he had celebrated during the Saturday night at the demonstration, "I'll tell you what-these things were improper.
It may not have been it, but they were the most improper gestures I ever saw."
Following the defense of the candidate of the Supreme Court who has been accused of a sexual attitude by three women, the President declared that the Democrats are being used for their purposes.
"They are willing to do anything to recover their power.
They're bad, they don't care who's hurting them, who's going to crush them to get their power and control,' said the president, who's given it to the Mediaites to know.

It was the third failure of the Elte league during the season for Adam Keefe's boys who lost 2-1 against the Dundee of Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the period of two groups, and Giants won the first three games.
Dwyer's opener arrived in the fourth minute, 3:35 minutes, thanks to Kendall McFaull's help, and four minutes later David Rutherford helped Beauvillier and he doubled the marker.
It was a living beginning, because during the 13:10 minutes, Matt Marquardt brought with him Cownie and he brought the goal in 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer wanted to make sure that the flag-maker was on his side for the first rest of the night, and at the end of the first division he put into his second goal of the night.

A air driver died so that hundreds of hundred flights of planes escaped an earthquake.
An Indonesia air control has become a hero after having assured him that he had a hundred passengers to take a proper plane and die.
More than 800 people have died, and many more have disappeared since a great earthquake struck Sulaws on Friday and caused a tsunami.
Many strong streams have occurred in the field, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Pallu.
Although his colleagues had fled to save their lives, Anthony Gunawan Agung of the 21st year refused to abandon his post and to leave the control tower at the Mutarian Sis Al Jufri Airport Airport.
On the other hand, he stayed there to make sure that the flight of Barti 6321 of Air was properly taken up, which was now on the track.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he saw that he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
As Yohannes Sirait said, the voicepiece of the Indonesian air navigation saved hundreds of lives by the decision, which he had given to know the ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balkpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter came to Palaura.
"Our hearts break when they hear it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid the rate of death will increase to thousands of persons, and the Indonesian table says that the entrance to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited to the villages.
"The Tasa is thought to grow still, for many bodies are still under the ruins, and we have not been able to reach many others," said Sutopo Purwho, the voice of the table.
The waves of the maximum six meters have destroyed Palu, and on Sunday the mass burial will be there.
They're bringing out military and commercial support and supplies.
Risa Kusuma 35-year-old mother explained to Sky News, "Minutur, an ambulance full of corpses.
Clear water is October.
People are stealing all the food from small markets."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Cross in Indonesia, explained to the CNNN chain, "The Red Indonesia Cross is working as fast as possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find there.
This is already tragedy, but it may be worse."
Indonesia's President Widoddo arrived at Palura on Sunday, and he explained to the army of the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to complete the occupations of the Union.
"Are you ready?" declared CNN's chains.
This year, another earthquake in Indonesia shook him, which happened in Lombo, and more than 550 people died.
A plane accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the air crash that happened on a lake.
The airline that operated on a lake in Micronesia, now says that a man is gone, after the 47 passengers and crew had said that the plane was sinking properly.
Mr. Niugini said in a edition, he couldn't make sure a man's traveler was missing until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said that he's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find a man.
The airline did not reply at once to the journalists (as well as age or nationality) who asked for more information about the traveler.
Thanks to local boats, the rest of the passengers and the crew were able to rescue them after the plane fell into the water on the island Airport.
The agents said Friday, they took seven people to the hospital.
The airlines said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in a stable situation.
What caused the accident and the exact order of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. army said the plane fell in the lake next to the track.
Some witnesses thought the plane had run through the track.
The American traveler Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"That's a terrible good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had easily reached the bottom of the plane's emergency conditions, which reached their waists in the water.
The nails were scared and he said they were rioting and he had a little wound in his head.
The U.S. military said that the help of the fishermen who were working on the minstrels around the dock was very helpful in the rescue work, for which reason a pulpful ship had been used to carry passengers to land before they sank into the water thirty feet (100 feet).
Based on Aviation Saferty Network network data, 111 people have died in the last two decades of airline accident registered in PNG, but none has ever been due to Air Niugini.
A relative has completed the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor delayed the case on Saturday, in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman of Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowett, a member of the US Department of Justice Department, tested for several hours as an expert witness of mental analysis.
As he introduced it to the jury, he used phone records to connect the movements that had been made on the night of Quinton Tellis 29 years old and Jessica Chambers were victims of 19 years to the death of a woman.
Rowlett said that the woman died last night, she received some of the pieces of cell phone records that show she was with Telis Chambers, so she denied Tellis's previous statement according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis's mobile phone was with Chambers when Tellis said his friend Michael Sanford was with him, and then the policeman went to Sanford.
Sanford appeared in front of the judge on Saturday, and he testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor Telllis said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he asked him if he had told the truth, he said he was talking about "ghasts," because the truck was in Nashville.
There was another coincidence: Telllis said he'd known him two weeks after Chambers died.
According to the phone records, they only met a week ago.
Rowett said after Chambers' death, Tellis wiped out Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from the phone.
"He deleted it from life," said Hale.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the latest lawyers.
The judge said the trial will be passed that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip-hop?
A trio that makes hip-hop music wants to challenge people who have negative opinions about the type of music, and that's why they'll fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed team of Bristol says hip-hop music has abandoned political messages and social problems in its first principles.
They want to go back to his roots and get the conscious hyp-hop to be known again.
Some artists, like The Fugees and Commons, have lately seen the resurrection of such a hyp-hop in the United Kingdom, for example, through Acala and Lowkey artists.
Another nigger?
A New York nurse has accused a couple of girls to fire her after a message like "starist"
A new- York nurse accused a couple of girls after having received a message from her mother that she wasn't for her fault because of a mistake, and that she was "other nigger."
He has denied that he is a philosopher, saying that the accusation is too much."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, surprised the new worker who would take care of the children when he heard that Giselle Maurice was black, when Maurice came home on his first day in 2016.
"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, A VOLTZ," she wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, and twice.
According to the news of the New York Post, when he noticed the mistake, he felt "deferous" in Pleasco-Flaxman, and fired Miss Maurice, who was a prior-born, afro-American, who had not been a good worker, and who, for him, expected a filipine infant.
He paid Miss Maurice for that one day's work, and asked for a Uber to take her home.
Now Maurice has accused his partner, and has asked him for a compensation for the damages caused by being fired, among other things, $350 a day for six months, and even though he has no contract, he was hired to live in the house for six months and take care of it.
"I want to show them that such things are not done," he explained on Friday to the Post-paper, and added, "I know it's a disrimination."
He said that it was reasonable and necessary to fire Maurice because he was afraid they couldn't trust him after he had insulted him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to tell her.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," Joel Plasco explained to the post-log.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person whom you have offended, even if it were a fault?
Your baby?
No way."
Pleasco said that the child had been short of two months, and was "in a difficult situation."
"Will you seek someone with that attitude?
That's not a good attitude," added the investor.
The legal case is still in progress, and the court of public opinion has immediately accused a couple of social networks, punishing them for his conduct and logic.
They were afraid that Paddington's publisher might like a bear talking to the readers, as a new letter has shown.
"It's hard to put it in the place of someone who read it before he published it.
It's very amusing to know what we know about Paddington's great success now."
Father BBC was a cameraman with a small toy bear before he had an inspiration to write a book for his children; as his daughter said, his father had an optimist attitude for neglecting his work, and added that his anniversary had had a "flame" taste of the book, for he had died last year.
As for Paddington, he says that he was the important member of the family, and that his father was proud of success at last.
"He was a silent man, and he was not vain," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, that he almost felt as if he were a child who has something to do with it-you are proud of him, although it is not your own achievement.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was the creation of his imagination and his merit, he always confessed to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say hello to her on the phone.
As soon as they landed, she was taken to the Hostal Louis Purur 2 hospital in Nice, but the doctors couldn't do anything to save her life.
"Nad called to say that it was very serious, that he did not think he was going to come," said Mrs.
"Then I got a call from Nad to say he'd die in two minutes and I'd have to say hello to him.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The doctors, who had given him to beat his heart, were gradually exhausting his system.
He died a little sooner than he thought, and it was over.
All I could do was sit down and wait, knowing that it would all start there.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to keep it up."
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laprouse, who had since been disappointed by her daughter's death, went up to the plane with the rest of the passengers, forgetting her grief.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"My head was bent, and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and he needed them to understand.
I knew how much he loved her."
Some upset women put signs on a bridge to prevent people from killing themselves.
Two women who have lost their lives because of suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put signs on a Wales bridge, those signs have positive messages and phone numbers so people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to be in a state of depression, and killed himself when he was 18.
'I don't want any parents to feel what I have to feel every day,' he said.
Mrs Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, she said her son had a special gift for cooking, and his smile was infectious.
"They all knew him because of his smile.
They always said his smile lit up anywhere."
However, before he died he left his job, because it was 'very dark'.
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler found his brother after he took his life away.
Davis said, 'I don't have to worry if there's any dominonial effect.'
Mrs. Davis created a series of signs that you can tell people what's happening to you and people who can help you, even though they're a friend.
Don't shut up, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she, too, had been her partner for 15 years just after the death of her mother, who lost Mark.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed," he said.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we felt that he had changed his attitude.
On Christmas Day he was in a state of dizziness;
He said his death was a lot of trauma to them, but they have to go on, "He leaves a hole in his family.
It makes us sick.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in danger after the FBI investigation has started.
"I thought," said Mr. Flake, "if we could get something like he asked for, such as a limited time or a limited district investigation, maybe we could get a little union," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, and he added that he was afraid the Committee was "participating."
Why didn't they want the FBI to investigate the case by Mr. Kavanaugh and his republican followers?
The contrary is because of time.
Only five weeks are missing for half-time elections, they'll be on November 6th, and the Republicans expect bad results, and so they'll begin their own man who wants to be elected for the Supreme Court of the Country.
George W. Bush has given many phone calls to the senators and has pressured them to protect Mr. Kavanaugh, because Mr. Kavanaugh worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and recognized his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What's going to happen after the FBI's report?
The vote will be made in the Senate where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's not clear yet that Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate; if so, Vice President Mike Pence could break the draw and introduce it to the Supreme Court.
The number of fugitives from North Korea has "been" since Kim is in power.
The number of people who escape from North Korea to South Korea has been lowered since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, as a South Korean legislator has said.
Park Byeong-Seug, quoted information from the South Korean Union Department, said that they had been fugitives the last year, on the 272706 of the fugitives, had been in 2011.
Mr. Park, as Mr. North Korea and China said, strengthening the controls on the frontiers, and establishing larger fines for human players.
Pyongyang didn't make any public comments.
Most of the fugitives from North Korea are offered to almost everyone in South Korea sooner or later.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 Northerners have passed the border in 1953 since the Korean War ended in Korea.
Most of them fled through China, which is the longest limit to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the unmistaked (DMZ) area between the two races of strong protection.
China considers the fugitives as illegal imigants, and not as refugees, and frequently retires by force.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war, and their relationships between them have obviously improved during the past few months.
In the course of the month, the leaders of both countries joined Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations of denuclorization that were stopped.
In June before, the historical meeting between President Donald Tramp and Kim Jong-un happened in Singapore, where the unsullied mainland was agreed on Korean.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Out-Afers in North Korea, Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress.
"If we don't trust an American, we won't trust it in our national security, and we won't leave our weapons first," said Mr. Ri said in a speech from the United Nations who were celebrated in New York.
Nancy Pelosi told Brett Kavanaugh that it's a "hysteric" and that he's not ready to be in the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, leader of the minority of the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysteric" candidate for the Supreme Court, and that genius isn't ready to be in the Supreme Court.
The comments that Pelosi made on a conversation on Saturday, was celebrated in Austin, Texas Tribun Festival.
'I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever done so, you would have said it was possible,' said Pelosi, and that was the reaction that Kavanaugh had given to the Judial Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied that Christine Blasey was sexually attacked by Dr. Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his first speech, Kavanaugh was very sensitive, and sometimes he almost began to shout and whisper about his family and youth.
Moreover, he actually accused the Democrats of the Committee, and the Allegory against him said that the Liberals who are angry at the loss of the election for the 2016 presidential elections are a "difamacy" organized and insulting.
Pelosi said that the testimony of Kavanaugh can't be in the Supreme Court, because he has shown that he has an indifferent opinion against the Democrats.
"With this assertion and his attitude against Clinton and the Democrats, he's out of line," he said.
Pelosi objectated if they chose Kavanaugh and the Democrats got the majority of the Representatives' Chambers if they asked him if he would oppose him.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not willing to be in the Supreme Court nor be in the court at this moment," said Pelosi.
Right now, Kavanaugh D.C.
Pelosi, as a democrat, is concerned about the verdicts that Kavanaugh will make against the law of health for use or against Roe v. Wade, as a personal justice.
In the confirmation court, Kavanaugh avoided questions when they asked him if he'd put some decisions back in the Supreme Court.
'A hysterical and indifferent person can't expect us to go to court and take good care of it,' said Pelosi.
And women must command.
It's a legitimate speech, a terrible rage of months and years, and he can't let her go without crying.
"We weep when we get angry," said Miss Steinm, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's strange, do I?"
"A woman who was an executive of some sort helped me terribly, and told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique when she was angry and she was crying, and she said to the person who was talking to her, "Because I'm sad, you can think I'm sad.
But I am angry."
And then he went on.
And I thought it was a great idea."
Tears aren't bad at sight for anger, because they're partly misinterpreted.
I remember clearly something that had happened to me in one of my first jobs. Most of them were in a man's office where I was crying with rage once, and a grown woman grabbed me by the neck.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, and they'll feel good because they understand you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Democrat of the Colosselado Council then, and he worked with Gary Hart for his presidential career.
In 1987, when she found out that Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called Monkey Buines and that his wife was not in love with another woman, and that when she refused to run, Miss Schroeder decided to be the same candidate for the presidentship.
"It wasn't a good decision," she said, laughing thirty years later.
"There were already seven more candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called them White Eduren and the Seven gnomes.
The campaign began a long time ago to collect the money he was after, so he decided he wouldn't be in the race until he collected $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He learned that some followers who gave the men $1,000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I have an affair?" he asked himself.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not make an official campaign, he was very touched with the public gratitude, the money, and the voters, instead of the representatives, he had so difficult an opportunity to take up with the system, and his anger with sexic attitudes.
"You must have thought I was very nervous," remarked Miss Schroeder, who had seen her reaction.
"You must have thought Kleenex was my protector.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
"Did he cry?"
The benefit of the commercial war between America and China can be added to Beijing
The savings which determined the beginning of the commercial war between the United States and China were noisy, and although there is a vital conflict, there may be a long time between the country and the country, as the experts say, to benefit Pekin.
Donald Tramp, the President of the United States at the beginning of the year, put a tax on the major products of China which he exported, among other things, sun panels, steel, and jelly.
The most significant ascension has arrived this week, for new rates will be applied to products worth 200 billion dollars ($50 billion francs) to half the merchandise which are to be carried from China to the United States.
Beijing has managed to apply business every time, and the last rate has been to raise the tariffs between five and ten per cent to American merchandise worth $60 billion.
China has said that every rise in the United States will be equal, and the second most powerful economy in the world will not be able to change it so easily.
To ask Washington to go back would bring him to court, but it would be more shameful to submit publicly to the United States to Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, the experts say that if Pee did well, the pressures for the commercial war in the United States might profit China in the long run, because it would destroy the dependence of the two economys.
"Washington or Pequin's politics would make up their minds to make an economic rocker in one of these two countries. This is more dangerous than the observers thought," said Abiegil Grace, the researcher, who investigates Asia in the New Security Center.
Syria is "prest" in order to return the refugees, as the Minister of Outer said.
Syria says that she is willing to return the refugees who wish to return, and she seeks help to rebuild the country which has been destroyed for more than seven years.
Directed to the United Nations' General Assembly, the minister of Waid al-Moole Outer said that the state of the country is improving.
'It's a more stable and more secure situation today,' he said, 'in the progress of terrorism.'
The country destroyed by terrorists continues to be reversible, so that they can return to normal as fast as possible.
Now it is proper that the refugees who wish to return willingly should be allowed back to the country by terrorism and by the economic measures which made their daily life and maintenance difficult.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
The other six million people who live in the country need humanitarian support.
Al-Mouame said the Republic of Syria will be very grateful for the rebuilding of the country destroyed.
But he declared that he would not accept the support of those countries which gave them protection from the conditional aids and revolts.
Europe has received the victory of the Double Cup which has been celebrated in Paris.
After the conquest of the U.S. team with 16,5 points on the last dialer, the European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup which has been celebrated at Lelf National outside Paris (France).
The United States has lost six times in a succession of European lands, and has not won a cup of Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again carried the crown when Captain Thomas Bjorn got the 14-5 points he needed to defeat America.
The American Phil Mickelson star had spent almost a bad time over the whole tournament, and he threw the hit into the water in the 16th hole of the third part, so he passed the witness to Francesco Molina.
The Italian golf player was a lot on every turn, and since the current format of the tournament began in 1979 it became one of the four players who got the results of 5, 0 and 0.
The American Jordan Spieth has obtained 5 and 4 results and remained outside against the worst European team player, Thorbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, who is the best player in the world, got 2 and 1 results against the kingdom of Ian Pulter, and arrived at the final drink of Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, the Spanish winner of the championship, with the 25.5 race points.
"I don't cry at all, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So he's grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very glad to have my drink back.
This is a teamwork, and I'm glad I could help it," said Garcí, moved, after Europe's victory.
He passed the witness to John the Spanish Ram who defeated Tiger Woods's American myth at 2nd Sunday game.
"I am very proud of being defeated by Tiger Woods, when I saw him," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost four games he played in France, and now he's 13, 21, and he's recordable in the three results on the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics, for one of the best players that ever was, who has won 14 main titles, only over Jack Nickuas.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend looking for a way out except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finzi-players, who played a good golfing game during the whole tournament.
Jim Fury, Captain of the United States, said for the bad game of the group, "I'm proud of my boys; they tried.
This morning, we've made a slight pressure on Europe.
It didn't work out.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played very well.
We'll meet again with the US PGA and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we'll go on.
I love my 12 boys and I'm so proud to be their captain.
We must accept failure.
We're out."
