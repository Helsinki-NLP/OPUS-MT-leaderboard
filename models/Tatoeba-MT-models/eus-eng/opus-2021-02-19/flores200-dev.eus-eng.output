For the first time in the year China exported more cars than Germany, overcoming the United States and becoming the largest market in that industry.
It could be bigger than the United States in two decades.
A tropical Danielle storm, the fourth storm named in the hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic, has come up east of the Atlantic Ocean.
A storm on about 3,000 miles from Miami has a continuous wind speed of 40 mph per hour (64 kph) at the maximum speed.
As the scientists of the National Center have foreseen, Danielle will be strengthened and turned into water on Wednesday.
Since the storm is far from the ground, it is difficult to evaluate whether it is involved in the United States or in the Caribbean.

Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I've been in a state of makabro, trying to get out of here when he tried to break the windows.
The windows were playing with chairs, but the glass is uncanny.
'At last one of the panels was broken and they started to walk out of the window,' said Franz Kowal.
The stars transmit light and heat because of the energy that is released when hydrogen atoms are brought together to produce more heavy elements (or fusion).
The scientists are working for a reactor that will produce energy the same way.
But this problem is difficult to solve, and it will take many years to build useful fusion reactors.
The steel pin floats over the water because of the tension in the surface.
The tension in the surface is because the shallow waters of the water have more attraction over each other than over the mollusions of air above them.
Molecular waters make an invisible layer on the surface of the water, and by this the needles and similar objects float over the water.
The mouth of the modern ice patin has a double edge and a concave void between the two edges, and the ice gets better on both sides, even when it's worse.
As the lower part of his mouth is slightly curved, his mouth is twisted from side to side, and the edge of his contact with ice is curved.
If Patina turns to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if she turns to the left, the skater rotates the left.
To return to the previous power level, they have to release additional power from the light.
To do so, they transmit a small particle of light called 'fiton'.
Scientists call the process "suppression of murder" because the bright light esteems atoms, and thus transmit a photo of light. Light is a kind of radiation.
The following figure shows the atoms which are sending photos to the picture. In reality, photo pictures are much smaller than those of the picture.
Ftons are smaller than atoms!
After a hundred hours' exercise, the light bulb burns and the light bulb makes it soon.
Then you have to replace the light bulb.
First of all, the switch of the furniture that gives light must be off, or the wires out of the plug.
That's what you need to do if you touch the metal part of the light bulb inside or the metal base of the light bulb, because electricity can cause electrical shock, when it's half pressed on the light bulb.
The main organ of the circulation system is the heart and pumps blood.
Blood comes out of the heart from the pipe called artery, and returns from the pipes called waiting, which are called cauldrons.
The teeth of the Triteraops were able to tear away the leaves, but also to tear down the strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that trieralops ate their creeds, a kind of plant used in the cracene.
These plants resemble a small palm tree, and on the upper part they have sharp, thorny leaves.
The trieraops may use their strong beak to remove the leaves before they eat the trunk.
Other scientists say that these plants are very poisonous, and that there was probably no dinosaur that ate them, though now idle and other animals, like parrots (one of the descendants of the conservatives) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How would the gravity of Io make me? If you were standing on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than you weigh on earth.
The person who weighs 200 pounds on Earth (90 pounds) would weigh around 36 pounds of kg in Io, so gravity would cut you down.
The sun has no skin, like the Earth, that allows us to stand, the whole sun is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
The gas thins the farther we go from the centre of the sun.
The outer part we see when we look at the sun is called the photophasphere, which means the lightball.
Three thousand years later, in 1610, Galileo Galilei, the Italian astronomicist used a telescope that Art star has a phase to observe, just as it has moons.
It is because the difference of art star (or moon) is only lit up in the sun, and the stages of the Artior had guaranteed the theory of Copernicus, which said that the planets are spinning around the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, an English astronomicist named Jeremiah Horrocks looked at an English star-carved.
England lived a long time of peace after Danelaw's recovery.
However, in the year 991 Eelede had to face a fleet of the Vikings, the largest fleet ever since Guthrum's fleet.

Hangul is the only one that is used daily from the specially invented alphabets. It was invented in 1944, in King Sjong's reign (1418 - 1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of Josephon's race, and he is one of the most esteemed.
At first he named the Latin Hangul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum-that is to say, "right sounds for people's explanations."
There are many theories about the origin of the Sanskrito. One of them says that there was an migration from the Ariai from the West to the Indian, and that they had taken their language with them.
Sanskrito is an ancient language, and is equivalent to the Latin that was spoken in Europe.
The first book known in the world was holy.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, and has been the source of many modern languages in India, just as Latin is the source of many European languages (for example, French or Spanish).
At the end of the battle for France, Germany was preparing to invade the British island.
The Germans gave the attack the code name "the sea-dog." Most of the British army's heavy weapons and supplies were lost when it was removed from Dunkerque, so the army was weak enough.
But Marina of Germany was still stronger than Chiriegsmarine, and she could destroy any invasion-float that had been sent across the English Channel.
However, there were few ships of the King's Marina in the routes which had the greatest probability of invasion, for the Admirals were afraid to sink under the influence of the Germans.
Let's begin with the Italian plans, especially Italy was the "little brother" of Germany and Japan.
He had a weaker army and a weaker navy, though he had built new ships before the war began.
The main object of Italy was the countries in Africa, and they needed a place where they could capture these countries, to send troops, to cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
To this end they had to rid themselves of the British bases and ships which were in Egypt, and besides these actions the ships of the Italian army had nothing else to do.
Now, let's go with Japan, Japan is an island, like Britain.
The submarines are ships designed to travel under water and to stay under water for a long time.
In those times, they were very slow, and had a very limited sense of shooting.
The first of the war was to travel above all over the sea, but as it grew and became more accurate, they forced the U-boats to sink into the sea, so that they might not be seen by their enemies.
The German submarine name was U-Boot. The Germans were very good at driving and using their submarines.
Because of their success with the U-boats, the Germans were not allowed to be so many after the war.
Yes, King Tutankmona, who is sometimes known by the name of "The King Tut" or "the King of Tub," is the king of ancient Egypt most known in modern times.

However, the discovery of his grave in 1922 was famous, and though many of the graves of the past had been stolen, this tomb was left intact.
Most of the elements which had been buried together with the Tutankamas were preserved, including a thousand arts made of precious metals and rare stones.
Thanks to the invention of the wheels with radios, the Assyrians' wagons were more rapid, quicker, and the soldiers and other carts better prepared to overcome.
In the year K.A. 1000 the Assyrians used their first cavalry.
The cavalry are an army fighting on horses.
We know many politicians, scientists, and artists of Greece-the most famous person of that culture is Homer, the blind legend poet, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature-Iliada and Odisa.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous actors, and their theatres are among the greatest works of literature.
Another famous Greek person, Pitagoras, is mathematician, especially for the famous theorem of relationship between the sides of triangles.
There are so many considerations of the number of persons speaking the Hydi, that the language most speaks in the world is in the second and fourth places.
The number of native orators is altered, according as the dialects closely related to it are considered.
How much has it been counted between 340 and 500 million speakers, and that 800 million people understand language.
In everyday conversations, the two talkers can understand each other.
About the 15th century, Estonia had a great cultural influence on Germany.
Some German monks wanted God to come near the natives, so they invented the literal language of Estonia.
It was based on the German alphabet, and they added the character " feels good."
As time went on, several of the German words joined, which was the beginning of the illustration.
It was usual that the heir to the throne should go to the army immediately after school.
But Charles went to college, Trinity College (Cambridge), where he learned anthropology and archaeology, and later, History; he received a note of 2.2 (a second degree title).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family who got a title.
The Turkey of Europe (in the east or Rumelia, in the Balkan mainland) includes 3% of the country.
The Turkish territory is 1,600 kilometers long and 800 miles wide, and has the same shape as the rectangle.
The surface of Turkey, including the lakes, fills 783.562 square kilometers per square square square (300.948 square), and from these square 66 miles (29.73 square squares) are located on the south-west of Asia, and 23464 square kilometers (9174 square squares) in Europe.
On account of the surface of Turkey, the largest country in the world is the size of France and Great Britain combined.
It is surrounded by a sea of Turkey in three parts: the Aegean Sea on the west, the Black Sea on the north, and the Mediterranean Sea on the south.
Luxembourg has a long story, but he has independence in 1839.
Some of the now Belgium parts were part of Luxembourg in the past, but after the Belgium revolution in the 1830s they belonged to Belgium.
Luxembourg has always attempted to be neutral, but I and I have occupied Germany in the wars of the World.
In 1957, he was the founder of a Luxembourg organization, a institution known at the present time as the Union of Europe.
Drukgyal Dzong is a ruined fort and monasteryist and Paro is upstairs in the district of Pejdey.
In 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel created a fortress for remembering the victory which Tibet and the Mongolia Armies had won.
In 1951, a few relics of Drukgyal Dzong were preserved, including the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire the fortress was reserved and guarded, and now it is one of the most excellent factions in Bhutan.

In order to learn how to create interactive media contents, it must be conventional and traditional skills except that they are designed for interactive classes (i.e., doing graphical, editing audio and video, writers, etc.)
An interactive layout forces you to evaluate your approval for the production of media contents and to learn how to think freely.
The components of an interactive design project must be connected to each other, but each must also have meaning.
The Zoom lens disadvantage is that many more focus distances and lens elements are required to get the focus distance set than those with primary lenses.
This problem is getting smaller, because the lens stars are getting better standards in the production of lenses.
This allows you to create images similar to quality that are achieved with fixed focus distances, with lens zooms.
Zoom lens disadvantage is that the maximum lens opening (speed) is usually lower.
So it's harder to use cheap zoom lenses when there's no flash in the light condition.
When a movie is converted to DVD format, one of the most common problems is overscan.
Most TVs are made according to the tastes of the general public.
That's why the edges of everything you see on TV (top, below, on both sides) have been cut off.
The goal is to fill the entire screen, which is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edges will probably be cut too; and if the video is too close to the bottom, it will not look complete.
The traditional castle of the Middle Ages has long fed up his imagination, and the Just, the banquets, and the courage equal to Arturo, recalls them.
Though standing among the remains of a thousand years, you can easily remember the sound and smell of old fights; you can almost hear the noise of hoofs on the pavements, and smell the fear that rose from under the earth.
But is our imagination based on reality? To begin with, why did the castles build?
As used at that time, the Kirby Muxloe castle is more than a fortified castle.
With large glass windows and thin walls, he would not long face a lasting attack.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to build, the country had a pretty peaceful situation, and it needed only a defense against the small groups that walked here.
By the system of power the nations of Europe had a design to maintain the national sovereignty of all the States of Europe.
According to the concept, the work of all the nations in Europe was not to render one nation more powerful than the other, and consequently the national governments frequently changed alliances to maintain this balance.
The succession of the Spanish War was the first war that had the chief cause of the conflict.
This brought a very important change, for the powerful nations of Europe had no need of an excuse for religion, so the last thing to be named as a religious war of thirty years.
The temple of Artemis at Ephesus was destroyed by Herostratus on the 21st of July O.A. 356.
The Ephesians declared that the name of Herostratus would never be recorded.

Alexander, being king, offered to pay the money necessary for rebuilding the temple, and afterwards the temple was rebuilt after Alexander's death in O.A. 323.
Ensure your hand is at ease as you can when you play all the notes correctly; try and make no move that is not necessary for your fingers.
So, you get tired as little as possible. Remember, you don't need to press the keys fast to get the extra volume, as it does with the piano.
In the case of the accordion, to obtain an additional volume, you have to use the electorals with more pressure or speed.
It is the end of Misticism to be reality, dibinity, spiritual truth, or conscious consciousness of God, or to unite or identify with it.
The believer wants to have a right perception or experience, intuition, or perception with divine reality, or with God or God.
The trackers make certain lives or activities that serve to feed them.
Mistism distinguishes itself from other forms of religious belief and worship, because it places importance directly in personal experience of the peculiar state of consciousness, especially in peaceful, profound, happy, and euphoric experiences.
Sichism is a religion under India, founded in the 15th century of Punjab, because of a sectary division in Huntu tradition.
Sykh considers their religion as distinct from Hinduism, though they allow its Hindu roots and traditions.
The Girmat is called the religion of Sichh, which means "the path of the cross" in Pjabian, which is a fundamental part of all the religions of India, but is of great importance in sykhism, and constitutes the essence of the sykh beliefs.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guiru Nana (1469-159. After that there were nine others.

The civilization of the Indus valley was a civilization of bronze, which was on the north-west west of India, and was the largest part of the present Pakistan, taking certain areas of the north-west of India, and the northeast of Afghanistan.
Civilization was developed in the rocks of the Indus, whence its name comes.
A few experts say that this civilization had also been planted on the rocks of the Sarasvati which is now dried up, and for that reason it would have to be called the civilization of the Indus-Sarasvati. Others call it the civilization of Harappa, because Harappa had been the first pardoned site in the 1920s.
Thanks to the military character of the Roman Empire, there were many medical progresses.
The Emperor Augustus recruited the physicians, and even more he formed the first physician body of the Romans to use it after the battles.
The surgeons, among other things, knew the schopolamine of morphine and of the seeds of the seeds of the seeds of the seeds of the poppies.
In order to save the patients from gangenas they became ambitious, even in the use of screws and bridles to stop the flow of blood.
In several ages the Roman Empire had made great progress in medicine, and composed the majority of our present knowledge.
In the case of Pureland origami, you can only fold each one, you can't fold back folds and all other complex folds, and all folds must have clean positions.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s to help people with unuspected foldings or limited skills engines.
Children are sufficiently young by race and by race-sterotypes, and these race-sterie types affect their behavior.
For example, children who are identified with a minority race of stereotypes who work little at school tend to be worse results when they have a new stereotype related to their race.
In the United States, MySpace is the third of the most popular websites, and now he has 54 million profiles.
The websites like that have put on a lot of attention, especially in education.
Such websites have several advantages: for example, it is easy to prepare a page for school use, and on that page you can collect blogs, videos, photos, and many other resources.
It is very easy to enter that page, as there is only one web address, which makes it easier for the students to remember, so it will be easier for students who have difficulty using the keyboard or with spelling.
It may be adjusted, that it may be easy to read, and may be put as many colours as it pleases, as it pleases.
The confusion of mind-deficit is a neurological "sindrome," and the classic triangle of symptoms defined by them, aggressiveness, facility of disseminating, hyperactivity, or excess of energy.
It's not learning debilitation, it's the trouble of learning, it's the 3-5 per cent of the children, so it affects 2 million American children.
Children with AFN cost much attention to their school jobs, but they can easily focus on the activities they enjoy, for example, playing games, seeing favourite cartoons, or writing words without punctuation.
These children have a lot of problems in stimulating their brains because they do dangerous activities because they fight and contradict authority, because they can't appreciate their brains by common methods.
AFN affects their relations with their fellow-creatures, because other children can't understand why they act in this way, or why they write letters in that way, or why their degree of maturity is different.
As mentioned above, the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn was changed by the way in which it changed, and the fundamental rhythm of knowledge was changed.
The approach to obtain information was different. The pressure was in the capacity of each individual no longer present, and instead of it the ability to remember the text became the object.
On the whole, there was a manifest change in the performance as far as knowledge was concerned, and the approach to extend it.
Unlike other binoculars, hominidots don't use their hands for sleep, weight, or hang from tree to tree.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzee are of the same size and length, and this feature reflects the use of the hands holding weight when walking with their fists.
Men's hands are shorter than their feet, and falange is more direct.
The fossilized bones of two and three million years ago show that change of practice for manipulation from the locomium in hand.
A lot of people think that an artificially-induced intelligent dream can be a lot of trouble.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that clear dreams extend the interval between the REM states.
We sleep in the REM, and then the chance of getting our bodies back, and we can become less of a night's interval.
It's as difficult as you wake up every twenty or thirty minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on the number of attempts to make your brains clear night dreams.
From the very beginning the Italians were in the north of Africa, and on June 10th, 1940 the war was declared and a week after the British XI. The hussars had taken the Capuzzo of Libya.
In a trap on the east side of the forest, General Lastucci, General of the tenth army, had been captured by the British.
On the 28th of June, Marshal Italus Balbo was killed in an assault on the side of the party, the governor of Libya, and the supposed successor of Mussolini, when Tobuk landed in the city.
The modern scryma sport is played in many classes, the class of students who are learning at college, as well as professionals and Olympic tournaments.
They are generally formed in duels, one rival against another.
On golf, players use golf sticks to put balls in holes.
He plays at eighteen holes in a regular round, usually in the first hole, where the players start and end in the 18th.
He wins the player who makes least swings with a shot or a golf club.
He plays in the grass, and the grass around the hole is cut short, and is called green.
The most common kind of touristism may be that which connects most people to travel-the touristism of leisure.
People go to a place where their daily life is very different, where they can rest and enjoy themselves.
The beaches, the busy parks, and camps are places where tourists most visit.
If someone goes to a certain place with the purpose of knowing their history and culture, it is called cultural turism.
The tourists may simply visit the known places of a particular country or focus on a single area.
When the settlers saw this, they joined their reinforcements.
In the armies where they built the front posts were regiments of 1st and 3rd of New Hampshire, under the command of 200 men, John Stark and Colonel James Reed (both of whom had been appointed General).
Stark's men settled on the fence at the north end of the colony position.
When the tide opened the empty space of Mystic on the north side of the mainland, the fence was rapidly stretched out with a short stone wall, which ended in the north, on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake (30 m) in front of the fence, and the regulars gave orders not to shoot until past.
The basis of the American plan was in the form of a co-ordinate attack in three directions.
General John Cedwalder would attack Bordentown's breitzant, with the intention of locking up his reinforcements.
General James Ewing would have taken 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, Assunpi had defeated the bridge above Creek and prevented the armies from escaping.
2.400 men's main force of attack crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, and divided into two groups, one under Greene, one under the command of Sullivan to attack before dawn.
When you change half a mile from a quarter-mile race, speed is much less important and resistance is absolutely necessary.
There's nothing to say, a great runner half a mile, that is to say, a man who can do more than two minutes below, needs plenty of speed, but he's going to have to make a resistance and not want to.
It's best prepared to race in winter for the race and exercise on the upper parts of the body for the course of the race.
It's not only with proper habits of food that you can get an elite performance, but you can do a hell of a lot of work in the general health of young athletes.
To keep the healthy balance of energy, to practice the efficient habits of hydratz and to understand the various aspects of taking extras, can help athletes improve their performance, even more sport.
Running in the middle of the distance is a rather cheap sport, but there are many wrong ideas about the little equipment that is needed to be part of.
Productions can be bought as much as they need, but most of them have little or no performance influence.
It's possible that athletes prefer a product even though they don't have real benefits.
One of the essential parts of building all matter can be considered as atom.
It is a very complex entity, and according to a reduced model Bohr is composed of a central kernel that electrons orbit, just as the planets orbit the sun, somehow (see 1.1 image).
The core has two particles, neutrals and protons.
Protons have positive electric charge and neutrals have no load, but the electrots have negative electric charge.
In order to see the victim, you must first examine the situation to ensure your safety.
As you approach the victim, you must look at his position and see if there is an immediate sign of alarm.
If you're hurting him when you're trying to help him, it'll only do him wrong.
In the investigation it was proved that in the patients who were in mourning depression, fear, and thought were catastrophist intermediate between pain and inability.
Thought was the only effect of catastrophist activities in proportion to their weekly being organized, not depression and fear.
Those who practiced regularly needed more help as to the negative perception of pain, to distinguish the difference between chronic pain and the discomfort produced by the ordinary physical movement.
The capacity of seeing or seeing requires the senses of the visual system or the eyes.
The eyes have several structures which, according to the needs of the organism, have a degree of complexity.
Each structure has a capacity for different wavelengths, and they have different degree of acuteness. They also require different processes to give meaning to the input information and to give meaning to many numbers and to function in the best way.
The population is a collection of organisms belonging to a particular species in a particular geographical area.
When the individuals of an Population are equal to a specific fenoy, they are called monomorphic.
If the individuals have several modifications of a property, it is said that they are polymorphic.
The Tants have different stages of movement and nesting.
During the Nomadada, the Ant-Guards disfigured at night and camped day by day.
When the food is reduced to the right, it enters into the nomad colony, and in this phase, it makes colonies temporary nests which change every day.
Every one of these destructions or defile nomadas lasts about 17 days.
What's a cell? The word cell comes from the word "cella" in Latin, which means "small room," and for the first time was used by a microscopist studying the structure of the artella.
Cell is the fundamental unit of all living things, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
In the study of life cells are so fundamental and decisive that they are often called "the brick of life."
The nervous system maintains the domesticosis by sending nerves to the body to guarantee the circulation of the blood and to make the distribution of the blood homogeneous.
These nerves can be sent very quickly through the body, and the body is protected from possible threats.
The tornados hit a small field compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything in their course.
Trees rise and tear up the boards of the buildings, and cars blow up into the sky, and two percent of the most violent tornados last more than three hours.

Many people dream of traveling to another star, and some people want to know what's out there, because they think it's possible for aliens or other beings to live on another planet.
But if it ever happens, it's probably not going to happen for long.
Perhaps some day your great-grandfathers will be thinking of their ancient ancestors on an alien world?
Animals are all made up of cells, eat things and dig them inside, and most of the animals can be moved.
Animals have only the brain (though not all animals, for instance, they have no brains).
There are animals in all the fields of the earth, digging holes on the earth, swimming in the seas, flying into the sky.
A cell is the structure and smallest function unit of a living organism (e.g.
The cell comes from the Latin cella that means the small room.
If you look at living things with microscope, you'll see they're made of little squares or balls.
Robert Hook, a biologist in England, saw little squares in the artery with the microscope.
They looked like a room, and he was the first person to see the dead cell.
Items and compounds can go through without changing their positions.
The nitrogen has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen.
Another example is water, two hydrogen atoms and an atom of oxygen form a composite water.
It has the same molloccular structure, it doesn't matter whether it's gas or liquid or solid.
Although the physical situation changes, the chemical condition is equally preserved.
Time is something about all of us, and it affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand it.
For thousands of years, religious, philosophical, and scientific philosophers have studied time.
We live time like a series of events that pass from future to present and past.
The duration of events (length) is also how long it will be compared to.
You can mark the past of time by watching the repetition of the cyclic events.
Computers are used to manipulate images and videos today.
Fancy animations can be built on computers, and this kind of animation can be used more and more on television and movies.
Music is often recorded through fancy computers, for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand had been the people of Maori, who had hunted giant birds called nuns.
According to the theory, the people of Maori sailed from Polynesia on a large fleet and took down New Zealand from Morioi, and established a weary society.
However, evidence suggests that Moriors were a group of continental Maori, which migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands, and developed their peaceful culture.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands, which was the Maoria who left New Zealand.
They called themselves Morio, there were some small fights, and at last the Morioi were destroyed.
The individuals who have been involved in several decades helped us to value our forces and our tastes, while we valued difficulties and defeats with dignity.
We listened to each of them's individual stories, family and organization, to some personalitys with positive or negative influence in the culture of the organization, and to some interesting information about the past.
Although understanding the story of one does not necessarily understand culture, at least it helps people to know where they are placed in the history of the organization.
When you are aware of success and failure, all the members of the community are more fully acquainted with the values of the organization, the mission and the moving force.
In this situation, the former active attitude, and the recollection of their success, helped the people display themselves in favor of new changes, and in favor of the new direction of the village church.
These stories of course diminished the fear of changes, and gave rise to a positive tendency towards future changes.
The patterns of the convenient thought are techniques to solve the problem, and they combine several ideas or fields to find a solution.
This thought rests upon speed, logic, and exactness, as well as on the identification of events, on the use of available techniques, and collecting information.
The most important feature of this thought is, that there is only one correct answer. There are therefore two possible types of answer, correct or wrong.
The thought of this kind is closely connected with several scientific procedures or standard procedures.
Men who think thus have logical thoughts, and are capable of remembering patterns, as well as of repairing their problems, and of working in scientific matters.
Men are a species which best reads other people's thoughts, overcoming them.
Which means that we are able to guess correctly what other humans know, believe, or will, what they know, or what they mean.
Among these qualities, it is essential to conceive the thoughts of others, and enables us to resolve the possible ambiguousities of physical actions.
For instance, if you saw someone break a window in a car, you'd probably think he was trying to steal somebody's car.
If he lost his car keys and tried to get into his car, we should have another opinion.
Images of magnetic resonance are based on a physical phenomenon called magnetic magnetism (EMN), which Felix Bloch (in the University of Stanford) and Edward Purcelle (Hanvard of University) found in the decades of 1930.
In this resonance, by the magnetic area and radio waves, atoms send small radio signs.
In 1970, Raymond Damadia, the doctor and the science investigator, found the grounds for using figures from magnetic magnetism as a means of medical diagnostics.
Four years later, a patent was given, and the first patent was made in the world in the area of magnetic images.
In 1977, Dr. Damedian had completed the construction of the "full body" scanner of magnetic images, and he named it the "unserable."
Async communication encourages time for reflection and reaction in others.
It allows students to work at their own rates and control the rhythm of their education.

The use of the Internet and of the Wide World enables students to access information at any time.
Even the students can send questions to teachers at any moment of the day and expect a fairly rapid answer instead of waiting for the next moment to see each other.
The postmodern method of learning gives absolute freedom.
For knowledge is not only proper to learn, but knowledge is in experience between the student and the knowledge presented.
We just live in presentations of the Brikillae and the information, and that is reflected by the television activities based on learning.
There's a lot of us watching a television program that we'll never be able to participate in the process or experience that we'll ever be able to practice.
We'll never test a car, build a fountain in the garden, travel to Peru to study old ruins, or repack the neighbor's house.
Thanks to the optical fiber and wide-band satellite that connects with Europe, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has the Internet connection.

Although the word "eskimal" is accepted in the United States, many of the Arthic nations, which are not Americans, are regarded as peripheral, especially in Canada.
Even if you listen to the natives of Greenland that word, it's best not to use the foreigners.
The natives of Greenland call their heads Inuit in Canada, and Kalallelq (plurala Kalallit), gronenland, Greenland.
In Greenland, even in the countries there is no "hard zone."
The weather is cold, maybe the only risk that doesn't come up.
If you come to Greenland in the cold season (more and more north, more and more cold), it is likely that you can bring back some clothes that are hot enough.
