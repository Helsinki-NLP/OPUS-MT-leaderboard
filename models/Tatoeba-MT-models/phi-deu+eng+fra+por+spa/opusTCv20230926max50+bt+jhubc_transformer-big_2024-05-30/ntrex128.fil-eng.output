"Welsh who saved 'like muppets'"
There was fear in their AM on the initiative that they should change their title and become MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It was planned to change the name of the assembly and make it into the Welsh Parliament.
AMs from all colors of politics can make fun of them.
An AM from Labour, worried their group that "it sounds like Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't come from Wales: In Welsh, the twp and tae mean nothing.
An AM from Plaid said that the group in general was "unhappy" and that they suspected that they could afford to buy.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group's "mind" of changing the name, but he also said that the MWP didn't move away from the word Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh and the letter u in Yorkshire English is the same.
According to the Assembly Commission, which currently enacts legislation to change the name: "Any final decision is made by what Assembly Members call members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation with initiatives that received extensive support calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding what the AM calls, the Commission favored Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support from public consultation.
In addition, it gives us possible to buy AMs, but President Elin Jones can make it painful for him to agree on everything, hoping to create legislation in just a few weeks.
The reforms will include other changes in assembly running, including conflicts with AM disqualification and the design of the computing system.
It's in the AM that the last vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonian votes in the referendum on the transfer of the country's name
There will be a poll on Sunday whether to change the country and make it a "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote will be held in the desire to remedy their decades of hysteria next to Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
For some time, Athens has been demanding to be a member of the EU and NATO, and it has been admissible to its neighbors to take over their territory.
This Macedonian leader, Gjorge Ivanov, who was pushing for a plebiscite to change his name, did not want him to respect the vote.
However, these supporters of the referendum, including Chief Minister Zoran Zaev, are only part of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Swallows Silenced as the Churches in Harlem spread
"Once," said the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church at every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Now, there's nothing."
The loss of bars is understandable.
"People's interaction is different nowadays," he said.
"It's not the fault of town bars where people always go."
Also in the churches, he's going to say that he doesn't wait as long as the leaders expect the pawns to get from the sale of the bills, "whenever they come back where they're starting."
He added that apartment complexes filled with condominiums of the sort of people who could not help the remaining sanctuarys of the community could be replaced.
"The majority of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said, "so that it will only allow one day for these churches to close because these churches will still go a long way off and they will be part of those people's churches."
The same church was allocated to white congregations before the metropolis of Harlem - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist Congregation resigned in the 1930s.
The black congregation, which was a member of this building, took its title.
The black congregation renovated St. Martin's under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shopkeepers at 125th Street, a main street for choice in Harlem, which opposed the reception or promotion of blacks.
The building was destroyed by a fire in 1939, but while making plans by Father Johnson's parishioners, they inaugurated Carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, called the carillon "malatal jokes."
The artist who played the carillon in July called it differently: "a cultural phenomenon" and "an inalienable and wasteful instrument."
In addition to Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, it was the first carillon played in the world by black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who played the larger carillon in Riverside Chruch 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said he had not replaced St. Martin's.
The event at St. Martin's these last months was a fascinating story of architects and contractors, some of which were introduced by uninformed church leaders and others entered by the Episcopal diocese.
Starting with the diocese in July the vestry - the parish administrator, formed by unordered leaders - was concerned with "extinguishing the expenses" of the diocese on the vestry, even though the vestry did not involve the reception of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complain of a lack of honesty on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old lobster hunter in California recently remarked
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was watching for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Ani Chad Hammel on San Diego's KSWB-TV, he had been observing for half an hour on Saturday morning with his friends when he heard a boy asking for a visitor and he approached it with his team to spare him a shower of water.
Ani Hammel, he thought it was just a screaming in the lobster's laziness that he heard, but "I jokingly screamed, 'I bite!
I got bitten!"
"It's been a long time ago," Hammel said, as he approached the child.
"I've hit all the water races: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by airlift where he was listed on a critical condition.
Not sure what kind of shark responsible for the attack.
This lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles at a media rally, there was a shark in the area a few weeks ago but it wasn't identified as a dangerous kind of shark.
Giles added that the victim had contracted an upper body injury.
Officials have held access to the coast from Pontus Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are over 135 kinds of sharks in the area, but it is not regarded as dangerous for most of them.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams using beauty aisles in the style of department stores with specialist assistants.
As a significant part of the entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn UK beauty market, which continues to grow as the advantages of fashion and clothing fall, will try to make it a larger beauty aisle in 11 stores across the country, and will be added in the next year if it succeeds.
Beauty's investment is rising while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill spaces in the shelves that used to be used for TVs, microwaves, and household equipment.
At Sainsbury's, they doubled their sales in beauty to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
It also receives additional branded space present products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees as seen in Boots-like stores.
The supermarket also offers Boutique makeup's products to be in favor of vegans for most of what they sell -- something that a growing number of shoppers want.
In addition, Sainsbury's retail stores will be trying to sell the Fragrance Shop, first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the coming part of the year.
It's online shopping and picking up small-day meals at local convenience stores that make supermarkets more effortless to encourage people to come.
This Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, will be more like department stores as the supermarket chain fights discounters like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-foods.
Sainsbury's outlets put in old shops and have also entered some Habitat since they bought the same chain two years ago, which, according to them, helped increase grocery sales and generated a lot of revenues.
The final attempt by the supermarket to change their beauty and pharmacy departments has not been successful.
Testing a partnership with Sainsbury's with Boots in the early 2000's, but it stopped after having an argument on how to divide the revenue from its chemist shops into supermarkets.
The new strategy began after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores in Celesio, the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Anila, Lloyds played a role in the plan by adding products of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Ani Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's: "We have changed the appearance and dating of our beauty aisles to beautify the surroundings for our selectors.
We also invest in workmates who have particular training and are able to give advice.
We have designed our brands across to meet every need, and the attractive surrounding and convenience locations mean that we are the main target for people for adventure to work in an affordable way of buying."
Peter Jones 'enraged' after Holly Willoughby withdraws on <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den's star Peter Jones turned away from TV spokeswoman Holly Willoughby from a <0xC2><0xA3>11million deal with his lifestyle brand business in order to deal with his new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for Truly, their home equipment brand and accessory.
The business of the couple is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning's spokesman, 37, announced on Instagram that he had left the business.
Holly Willoughby hired Dragons Den star Peter Jones to suddenly withdraw from their growing lifestyle brand business - to share his bumper contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
According to the information source, Jones was "angrily" and admitted to a golden TV girl at a concert on Tuesday at the headquarters of their boom business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that he didn't have time for Truly, his brand of home furnishings and accessory, asking for his new agreements.
Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand business is now being duplicated by Willoughby's worth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While advertising on Willoughby's Instagram, 37, his departure from Truly, Jones flew to one of his homes in Britain.
According to one source of information: "At present, Truly is Holly's main priority.
That would have his respect for the future that would leave him for decades to come.
The funeral surprised everyone involved in his retreat.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, too close to filming.
There's a warehouse full of Marlow HQ products ready for sale."
Business experts believe this morning's departure of a spokesman, one of Britain's most visible personalities, has been a tremendous investment in products ranging from mattresses and candles to household clothes and equipment, and the potential awareness of its performance.
And it could serve as the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin with three children had been near Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby started the Truly alongside Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as the leader in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is a dangerous M<0x26>S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm a Celebrity on ITV.
A source of information close to Jones said, "We won't give a comment on his business discussions."
A glimpse of 'and then befriended us'
She was criticizing the criticism she would receive from the news media for comments that could be made as "presidential" and for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Ani Trump in his loathsome bid in the voice of the "news anchor."
"I don't give up anything."
He announced that Kim would be interested in the second word after their first word in Singapore last June, which Trump recognized as a major step toward North Korea's democratization.
But the subjects of denuclearization have been recorded.
Three months after the statement in June in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not seeing "a corresponding action" from the U.S. in the deployment they were making.
Instead, he confessed, the U.S. kept close to maintaining the faith.
Trump was more optimistic in his speech at the rally.
"North Korea is in a good state," he said.
"We're going to fight North Korea.
Only millions of people will die.
Now, we've got a very good deal."
He's been doing positive things to beautify relationships with Kim - stop rocket tests, help with the welfare of hostages, and return home the lips of American soldiers.
And she's talking about her strange ways of communicating with Kim.
"It's too easy to be a leader, but rather to have 10,000 people out there trying to enter this scale arena, we have a minimum of 200 people standing right here," said Trump, while learning from the people directly in front of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Launch Island, Old Dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign national organizations were told that they weren't needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, there is no national emergency, a preliminary button for foreign aid.
"Many times, unfortunately, they've made it clear that they don't ask for help in other countries, so it's pretty difficult," said Bb.
And Save the Children is developing a team to go to Palu, but I'm still not sure if a foreigner can work in the area.
This Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the national vaccine, Indonesian officials are still investigating the situation in Palu to see if international personnel are allowed to participate in the relief effort.
In spite of the earthquakes that Indonesia often experienced, they weren't ready for the vitality of nature.
Even though there are tsunami shelters located in Aceh, they are not very common on other coastal waters.
The loss of a tsunami warning in Palu, as if someone were fighting a warning, was likely a loss of life as well.
As time goes by, the journey between the islands of Indonesia is a test.
Natural disasters are aggravating logistics.
An optional ship stationed at Lombok to detonate earthquake victims is currently headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's flood infrastructure the center of his election campaign, and he has already invested a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is plagued by funding shortages because of his impending legality next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with the beliefs of Indonesian sectarianism, where most Muslims cling to a more conservative age of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands lost their homes while Christian and Muslim groups clashed on the streets with Machetes, Satisfaction, and other hideous sandals.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge shoots to watch against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from the Premier League defeat against Chelsea in the 89th minute of the game on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge told <0x58>herdan Shaqiri about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team bowled 1-0.
He surprised the ball was left-handed before hitting it toward the far post of the goal.
The ball flew over the top of the box and blew it into the upper right corner of the net.
Later, the ball crashed into the net behind the sinking Kepa Arrizabalaga.
"That's just the right place, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to play as long as possible, so I'm just trying to get all the time I get," said Sturridge on LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming so I made it on a couch and I didn't think much more and I just slipped the tie."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after striking out in the 25th minute from Belgian Eden Hazard.
In that game, the Blues striker passed the ball back to Matthew Kovacic, before he went through the midfield and slipped into the Liverpool side of the field.
Kovacic is fast-paced in midfield.
He took a light heartball, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard fought the defense and settled with his left foot on the far post net beyond Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli on the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
The future of Chelsea will be videotaped by the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. in London.
The tsunami death toll in Indonesia at 832
The number of deaths in Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country’s staff of last Sunday.
It was reported that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that caused waves of up to 20 crashes, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a staff spokesperson, crashed into buildings at a news conference.

A man, 32, suspected of being assaulted and killed by a woman, was arrested by the police
An investigation into the murder was opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found with injuries at 7:55am on Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
They went to the city to see and hear what had happened.
Ani Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan: 'It was just the beginning of the investigation but I called out to anyone on John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard any suspicious talk about us.
I also called anyone, especially taxi drivers, who could get any footage on the dashcam to interact with us because they might have information relevant to our investigation.'
The Berkenhead police spokeswoman confirmed the woman was found and she was inside an estate.
This afternoon, friends who believed that they knew the woman came to ask where she found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are reporting the incident to nearby relatives of the victim.
An attempted entry by a taximan living in Grayson Mews on his flat but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.

Cromwell's Parliament's latest column of conflict to 'turn history'
The removal was a staggering reason because of his inhumane erosion of England's vast cultural and religious artefacts produced by his Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "judicial" and "planning to change history."
John Goldsmith, a member of the Cromwell Society, writes: "It is inevitable to avoid the current debate about the removal of statues that will make Oliver Cromwell a target outside Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order or demolish the demolition of sacred images in English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be the sacrifice because of what his forefather Thomas did a century ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's 19th-century creative work of Cromwell and part of the study of a well-established man's history is evidenced.
Ani G Goldsmith of The Sunday Telegraph said: "Cromwell is widely regarded, perhaps over the 19th century as the defender of parliament against outside belief, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
It's still a matter of historical debate as to whether this description is generally correct.
It was only then realized that the diversity in the middle of the 17th century declined in the next development of our country, and Cromwell was a unique person who would represent one aspect of that division.
It is also worth mentioning and worrying about his reputed Lord Protector."
Chinese Farmer's Killer Pigs
A farmer has been attacked and killed by pigs on a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by his surname "Yuan," was found dead and with a severed artery, bleeding near a pig's tomb at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig fighter was preparing to develop a pig vaccine in a pig pig on May 30, 2005 in <0x58>ining in Qinghai Province, China.
According to the report, she traveled with her cousin from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and there was an open door in the vicinity of the pig's tomb.
Now a large herd of pigs was grazing there on the hillside.
A forensic analysis confirms that the farmer received 550 pounds of pigs, according to the report.
"Daughter and reverse my cousin's legs," said his cousin, known only by his surname of "Wu," in Guiyang Evening News.
A video of the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body found an hour passed.
Yuan or his cousin did not own the animal that killed the man.
An Evening News market manager reported that the pig was detained in order to keep it safe, while the police were picking up evidence in the area.
According to the report, there was negotiations between Yuan's family and the market authorities for his death.
Although rare, there have been cases of pigs that have been infected by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked the woman and her husband at their Massachussets farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years later, a 650 pound pork caught a Welsh farmer on his tractor until his wife threatened to keep the animal away.
After his pigs had eaten a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not commonly aggressive, but may be "thrown" the taste of blood.
"They're just making fun.
They love to bite, to discover too much... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa will bring massive and rare rainfall to the south of the U.S..
Like this, Hurricane Rosa is calming down on its way to the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floods and rains across southern Mexico and south U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa, a Category 1 Hurricane, sustained 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was awakened 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is spreading over the Pacific Ocean and it is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical hivering toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical frosts will be produced in the approaching troughs of massive and heavy rainfall in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, it will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows, and landslides in the desert between 1 and 4 inches of rain.
Deep tropical moistures allow for a gap of nearly 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 2 and 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the Southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
It is possible to have flash floods with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the tropical rainfall's tropical climate.
It's not good to go out and walk through the desert with the threat of tropical rain.
The canyon can become devastated rivers because of heavy rains, and typhoons can cause local storms of violent winds and gusts of dust.
The approaching depressions will bring local heavy rains to some parts of South California's coastline.
It is possible to divide up to half an inch [half an inch], causing a slight flow of debris and a rough road.
It will be the first rainy season in the region.
Starting to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning some goal-till tropical rains, before rainfall on Monday and Tuesday evenings.
Rainfall fell on the Four Corners on Tuesday and lasted until Wednesday.
As the Arctic cools, a dramatic change in temperatures can be seen in October throughout the U.S., while the tropics remain relatively warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
There was a good example of extreme differences in temperatures across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There are some 20-degree differences in temperature between Kansas, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next day, the rest of the sun was tested to rise and rise again.
Hopefully, there will be a hot summer since October with a wide range of 80s in the middle and eastern U.S., from the Southern Plains to some part of the Eastern East.
New York may reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, achieving a higher 10 degrees in training.
Our respectable weather report states the high probability of higher average temperatures for the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people, as Brett Kavanaugh listened to
More than 20 million people heard the delegate testimony on Thursday by the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of sexual assault that took place during the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on a six-television network.
Meanwhile, the political struggle continued, with broadcasters delaying the regular program for the final Friday strike: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuit.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh helped him drunk and tried to get rid of him at a high school party.
In a heated testimony, Kavanaugh said that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reported more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company counted the usual number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
These numbers were not immediately available for the other networks that aired them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems with the number of people who watch the offices.
To make it more clear, this amounts to watching football playoff games or Academy Awards.
Leading the networks, Fox News Channel, where opinion hosts strongly support Kavanaugh's authenticity, with around 5.69 million viewers throughout the day's hearing, says Nielsen.
ABC has 3.26 million views.
CBS has 1.3 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million, and CNN has 2.52 million, says Nielsen.
The interest remained high after hearing.
Flake was a main character in the drama on Friday.
After a speech issued in favor of Kavanaugh by the Republican Moderate Assembly, CNN and CBS caught him on Friday morning lighted by protesters on the elevator to a statement by the Judiciary Committee.
She stood with her bare eyes, insulted her for minutes, and showed her live on CNN.
"I stood in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's saying the truth to the country?
He said, "There are a lot of women who don't have the power."
Before the closure of the elevator, Flake said that he made a statement about his welcome, which, in the hearing of the committee, would say more.
It was reported that the cable and broadcast networks would live for hours, while the Judiciary Committee would have to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake, however, said that he would do so only because the FBI was going to investigate the charges against the nomination next week, which is being pushed by minority Democrats.
Flake was easily convinced by their conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and many more senators, Flake formed the meeting.
Flake's decision had power, since it was clear that Republican votes would not allow Kavanaugh to be approved without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM accuses critics of Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticized her plans to leave the European Union "political" in Britain's future and to catch the country's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Britain's Prime Minister, came to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to May on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, launched his attack on May's foreign Chequers plan for Brexit, suggesting Britain and the EU should collect each other's lots of fun.

"It's what you're always worried about," said Wade.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The popocatepetl volcano, the Popocatepetl volcano, extends to residences in the southern capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention is advising Mexicans to withdraw from the volcano on Saturday after activity escalated into the crater and registered 183 air emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center tracks a lot of sensation and hearing.
Images on social media show thinners of ashes covering car windshields in mexican cities such as <0x58>ochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at a volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital after a 7.1-stumble in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano has been active as Don Goyo since 1994.
Police have engaged in conflict with separatists in Catalan before the anniversary of the vote of the bill
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after bargaining with pro-independence protesters against the riot police, while thousands were joining the opposition to hold the first anniversary of Catalonia's buffalo vote.
A group of masked pro-separatists raised eggs and powder paints on the mob of policemen who stopped them, and it made black clouds of dust on the streets commonly filled with tourists.
The mob also rioted, and the police used bulwarks to control the fights.
Pro-independence groups have called for many hours of "No forgetfulness, no forgiveness" ahead of unionists protesting, "Long live Spain."
Fourteen people were smuggled for small wounds caught by the protests, reports from local newspapers.
Tensions in the region that called for marriage remained high after the one-year referendum on October 1 that was illegal in Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose to vote on their own, with few voters voting because the majority of those opposed to the lifting of the ballots.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop voting in police stations across the region in violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday to stop the action to support the national police.
The movement continued but was forced to go by other routes.
Narcis Termes, 68, said an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, no longer hoping for the possibility that Catalonia would get the date.
"Last year, we experienced one of our greatest moments.
I watched my parents cry laughing because they knew but we're not coming here today," he said.
Despite the success of last December's regional elections, the pro-independence parties in Catalan struggled this year because of having married exiles and were waiting to hear many of their famous leaders for their role in organizing the referendum and for the declaration of independence.
Ani Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his protest phone to the police, with politicians on both sides fighting the violence.
"It's just getting worse," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in a pretrial prison since last year, announced that he was running in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a European candidate for election is the best way to condemn the reversal of democratic principles and disobedience we have seen from Spain's government," he said.

Menga's tie, Livingston win against Rangers, 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal cried out for Livingston's victory
He was surprised that Livingston would give the Rangers his second three in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's tie was the must-have for Gary Holt's Hiberian team to die in second place.
Gerrard's team remain unbeaten in the Premiership this season and will face the main Hearts with eight points, the following Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers would fight Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, prolonged their scoreless game in the six-game division, with head coach Holt who had not failed since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston has lost a chance against brusque visitors
Holt's team must have been leading long before they got elected, if not because of their being directly causing trouble for Rangers.
Scott Robinson was caught, but worked hard to make a good deal, and Alan Lithgow's horn moved away because Craig Halkett's header buried him.
The hosts were happy to play the Rangers in front of them, because they knew they could make the visitors harder with the points set.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers handed a free-kick and secured Livingston the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga, who got the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By that point, the Rangers had already gotten the ball, but they had a hard time sticking to the defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was a little harder.
This game continued in the second half, mostly to force Alfredo Morelos's savings from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was surrounded by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and moved Lithgow away from Livingston's other set play.
There are continuing to be moves on the side of Livingston and continue to be prosecuted, while two charges of punishment--after Halkett's execution with substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball--are concerned.
'Wonderful' from Livingston - review
Alasdair Lamont on BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Amazing games and results for Livingston.
In a person, they're great, they're constantly breaking expectations of higher growth.
They didn't almost change their style of play and people started out again when they became the best, but great compliments should go to Holt on his ties with the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading the organized defense, while Menga struggling Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the fight.
The Rangers, however, were not inspired.
No matter how well they came under Gerrard, they didn't reach those uncles.
They lacked their last ball--only once they opened their sides--and it seemed a call to the Rangers, found themselves in the middle of the ranks.
Erdogan gets a mixed reaction in Cologne
There were smiles and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aims to resolve relations between allies in NATO.
They fought about human rights struggles, freedom of journalism, and Turkey's ascent to the EU.
Then Erdogan would go to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
This city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police were responsible for the security of 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their leader.
The old anti-Erdogan protesters, most of them Kurdish, have also called on Erdogan's policies and the German government's policy to welcome him into the country.
The two different protests reflected the distraught guests who were considered the heroes of some German Turks and were violently abused as the dictatorships of others.
Deptford road guide: A cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died after hitting a car in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an unincorporated street in Deptford, in the southeast of the town, at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The crash occurred months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, almost a mile away from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that they're working to investigate the identity of the man and to let his family go.
Roads and other bus lanes have been set up and motorists have been advised to evacuate the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were hurt by the riot
Six prison officials were injured by the high-security riots that led to the release of the men, the Prison Office said.
The disturbance began with HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire starting at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is currently on the move.
The "Tornado" officer specialists were sent to deal with the riot, with eight prisoners being kept in one wing.
Officials contributed to the scene for small cuts in the face.
The Prison Service spokesperson said: "Special training figures have been sent to deal with the current HMP Long Lartin incident.
Six staff members were injured.
We are not trying to eliminate violence in our police stations, and we have made it clear that the responsibilities are being sued by the police and can be incarcerated for longer."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, along with the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the police officer was hospitalized after being attacked by a detainee.
And last October, rowdy officials called in prison to issue a serious riot in which personnel were attacked by ball pools.
Hurricane Rosa Prevents Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Water Area Can Benefit)
Tropical depression is rare for Arizona, but that's what could happen in the first part of next week because of the outbreak of typhoon Rosa in the Desert Southwest, bringing the risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has been monitoring flash floods for Mondays and Tuesdays across Arizona as far south as Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, along with the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa storms in Phoenix are expected to run outright on Tuesday, and it will be near Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that "next tropical storms have sustained a tropical storm or depression that has been 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a typhoon 40 miles from the AZ border."
The latest Hurricane Center models estimate between 2 and 4 inches of rainfall, which ranges from ten to six inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, which may have ranged from 10 to 4 inches.
To avoid threatening a flash flood, the Rosa rains could be a blessing because the region was in turmoil.
Although flooding is a serious concern, it is likely that these rains will be beneficial because the Southwest is currently in a state of turbulence.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 40 percent of Arizona detects malignant spin, the second-highest-level category," reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is going to landfall first on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Although storms are still high and wind speeds of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, typhoon Rosa is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, heading north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm absorbed the colder waters of the Pacific and was therefore severe.
So it is expected to landfall in Mexico in a tropical storm in the afternoon or Monday evening.
The rains in some parts of Mexico can become torrential, and there is a huge risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected in Baja California until southern Sonora, which could reach 10 inch," reports weather.com.
Then Hurricane Rosa would go to Mexico as a tropical storm before Arizona's border hit Tuesday early as a tropical depression, after which it was in Arizona as far south as Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or its lips was heavy rainfall in Baja California, southern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," said the National Hurricane Center.
Hopefully, these rainfalls will cause decisive flash floods and debris flows into the desert, and landslides in densely populated areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four, arrested in custody
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder, after a 16-year-old was found with injuries in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
She is taken to the hospital where she remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon, says Somerset Police.
Officials appeal to anyone who has footage of what happened on the phone.
'Trying Kavanaugh' to be cruel, the Democratic Party's rage, Trump said
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh was to eliminate the harsh and violent tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh was "hardened to be cruel, angry" by the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh stood before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally defending the allegation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had committed decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford was also prosecuted to hear about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's good quality and courage that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to confirm one of the worst brains in the law of our time, a jurist with a brilliant history of public service," he said to a gathering of West Virginia supporters.
The President succumbed to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking on the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections.
"It's only five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running," he said.
"So everywhere I am, defending the good candidate."
Trump said that Democrats' mission is to "fight and threaten."
Kavanaugh's first primary procedural vote for Kavanaugh's nomination was expected to take place in a void on Friday, said a top GOP leadership aide on CNN.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia killed prematurely, as high as expected
More than 384 people died, mostly hit by massive waves on the beach, after crashing and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival in the city of Palu on Friday overlooking the horizons of six meters (18 feet) during the twilight, since most of their deaths and ruining all of them.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"As yesterday's tsunami threat rises, people are still doing their jobs on the beach and are not leaving immediately and they have become victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, Indonesia's warning agency, in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Nowhere without a tsunami, it boils cars, houses, it hits everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that a tsunami hit the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Trees climbed the others to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
At least 16,700 people fled to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial images released by the vaccination agency showed many buildings and shops to be broken, bridges tolled and a water-surrounding mosque.
Aftershocks continued to blow up the town in the mudflat on Saturday.
2.4 million people felt a series of earthquakes.
In a statement, Indonesia's Agencies for the Assessment and Application of Technologists (BPPT) said that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times stronger in the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which stands at the end of a long and narrow bay, might have strengthened the force of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the rape as "floating" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, resorts, and hotels were taking place.
He said that the bodies of other victims were trapped under buildings, adding that 540 people were wounded and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that casualties and damage could be higher along the coastline of 300 km (190 miles) south of Palu, a place called Donggala, nearer the earthquake epicenter.
Communication "generally cut off without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are going into the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it can still grow," he said.
The agency was hugging the police on Saturday because they didn't say there was a tsunami threat in Palu, officials said that the waves were coming at the time of the disruption.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, a man was shown on the elevated side of a building shouting by the tsunami warning people in the streets below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hit the sand, since the buildings and cars.
Reuters didn't get the footage right away.
The earthquakes and tsunami caused massive power outages that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but still needs food outages and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until Oct.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami Death toll in Indonesia Tumaas Lagunas 800.
It's very well-informed.
As the staff of the World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were staying in the tarpaulin shelters that were placed in the yard where they had taken care of, they saw scenes of the damage along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's like this.
Even when disaster relief groups are beginning to devastate disaster relief, some have complained that disabled aid workers with severe skills are being prevented from travelling to Palu.
Indonesian governments say that funding, equipment, and foreign personnel can only start when the disaster zone has been declared nationally uninhabited.
It hasn't happened yet.
"These disasters are just a long way off," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., it's a national disaster," we're going to be open to foreign aid but not currently in state."
As the second night of the Palu earthquake and tsunami hit Friday, friends and families of those who lost loved ones continue to look forward to the miracles that could eradicate the horrors of global disasters.
On Saturday, there was a boy caught from a sewer.
This Sunday, rescuers evacuated a woman stuck under the grooves for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games that ended in its first month in Indonesia.
Some of those stuck in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As older in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled that, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to WhatsApp to Palu players, who were participating in the beach party.
But his message only resulted in a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blue checks.
"I think, that means that messages have not been sent," he said.
Thieves <0x24>26,750 while re-refilling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves charged <0x24>26,750 from a Brink's worker who had refunded the ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver's body leaves an ATM in the entertainment complex and enjoys delivering more money, writes Dennis McCarthy in the release.
While she was growing up, another man " ran from behind the person of Brink's" and stole a bag of braids that should be carried.
Several criminals were killed by witnesses fleeing the area, according to the release, but police did not address the number of suspects involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their association with the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: A rapper will change his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change her name -- to Ye.
In his announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, had been YES for some time, and he used the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change in her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yandhi.
She was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the release.
Apart from being the spread of his present professional name, West had already said that the word for him had a religious meaning.
"I believe that 'yes' is the easiest word in the Bible, and in the Bible, 'you' mean it," said West in the first part of this year at the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
"If that's so, I'm you, I'm we, it's us.
That's why you're talking about that, that's what you mean, that's just what you're talking about, whether it's just a mirror, a mirror, a good, a bad one.
The album reflects more about who we are."
He's one of the few famous rappers that have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known by different names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year, he advertised a passion for the names Love and Brother Love.
The former collaborate with West's JAY-Z was pleased with any or no spelling and large letters on the name.
AMONG Mexico, claiming not to use military against civilians
Mexico's President President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that military forces would never be used against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "the military will never be used to combat Mexican citizens."
Soldiers deployed at a peaceful demonstration in the open air on Oct. 2, 1968, where as many as 300 people died during the infantry movement across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support Mexican children by giving monthly aid to those who study and opening more public schools.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education would leave young people in criminal groups.
U.S., must double the withdrawal of A.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the cost of researching this creation, says AI's investor Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments were made after making ads about AI on the rest of the U.S. government, even if the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy as a whole.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it was supposed to be No.1 to change to AI by 2030.
"It's a great start to double the budget for researching AI, as the U.S. is seriously leaving all overseas, and we're looking for the next success of AI," Lee said.
A double-double stop in the U.S. will make the next big AI success, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who has the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Innovation Ventures, which invests in one of AI's most prominent companies in China, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
During the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American player in Otherllo, and then he became the host of Microsoft Research and chair of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's technological advances, such as the Robotics Challenge's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and was asked when the next project would be held, in order to identify future visionaries.
Usually, U.S. researchers need to work hard to get help from the government, says Lee.
"Not China takes the primary academics; otherwise corporations," Lee speaks.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been recruiting users from schools to work for AI over the years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy will help the U.S. to facilitate its efforts at AI.
"I think it's automatically offered green cards to those with a PhD in AI," he spoke.
China's State Council announced its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to people and academic institutions such as the funding of the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations to U.S. research organizations, but the quality of academic activities in China is lower, says Lee.
In the first part of this year, the U.S. Defense Department is hosting the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to treat industry and academia personnel, and the White House announces the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a <0x24>2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
In regards to the NSF, it currently invests more than <0x24>100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. law has not yet been seen to act for months to form a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians, vote to change the country's name in a referendum
The Macedonian people will fight to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in a referendum on Sunday, a move that will work to fix for decades when the time between Greece and the European Union is long enough for those who wish to become members of the NATO.
As he was going through Macedonia, Macedonia and Achaia, to spread the good news about your contributions among the Macedonians.
The two governments agreed on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists argued that the Slavic majority of Macedonia's ethnic identity would be changed.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and that the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout would reach the 50 percent minimum required to have a visa.
The referendum said: "Are you in favor of being a member of NATO and the EU along with the acceptance of the Greek treaty?"
Advocates for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is worth the effort to get into EU and NATO groups for Macedonia, one of the countries that have been evacuated since the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I go today to work for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the European Union because it means that it is safer for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not hurt by the law, enough members of the parliament said they would comply with the results of the vote to support it.
It takes a change of name to be a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state voting commission said that there were no reports of irregularity at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent of the previous 2016 parliamentary elections in which 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I'm jealous because of my children, we're in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an electorate in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his daughter Dushko, voted for a Macedonian referendum to change the country's name to NATO and the European Union to Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and held chairs in front of tents arranged by boycotts in the referendum.
"We're for NATO and EU, but we want to join high- notion and not enter the door of barriers," said Kavadarkov.
"We're a poor country, but we're dignified.
If they don't accept us as Macedonia, we can move to others like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that being a member of NATO will bring the urgent need to invest in Macedonia, with a loss of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority agrees because more than 80 percent of our people are in favor of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he voted.
He said that the "yes" result would be "proofing our future."
A vote reported last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters were involved in the referendum - less than the turnout required.
Another Macedonian Telma TV poll revealed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said yes.
For the referendum to be successful, it would have to be 50 percent, and a vote would have to turn around.
The referendum has been referred to as the first blow to the French government's policy since its election in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City kicks Brighton's entire defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling threw Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made the game easy with his points in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker will receive a midfield pass from the series.
He emerged between the three defenders of Brighton, before clinging to the open field.
Then Aguero saw himself surrounded by four green clothes.
He forced a defender ahead to run some more at the end of the Brighton box.
Then, she would cry to pass on to her left and find Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan with a tie on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with some trouble on his feet," City's manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he set a goal at that point."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues the start of the Premier League championship.
That goal enters in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball while in the middle of the Brighton territory in that game.
He sent Leroy Sane a good ball across the left flank.
Some touch Sane did before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward holds the ball into the net before moving across the border.
Hoffenheim won the Champions League game at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, wanted to play as a spoiler vs. Rockies
Once the Nationals lost the playoffs, there was no reason to push for another start.
But the all-time fighter Scherzer was hoping to get the spot in the Sunday mound in the match against the Colorado Rockies, but that's when the Rockies still have implications in the playoffs with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
In any case, the Rockies won a wild-card 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still have their first division title secured.
"We're playing for the left, we can walk in the mound, anyhow, knowing that the feeling here in Denver, along with the hangman and the other team, is possible the highest level of any point I'm coming to this person.
Why don't I want to fight there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they are inclined to let Scherzer go.
Scherzer held a bullpen session on Thursday to make his 34th start, and to pitch on his usual Sunday rest day.
The Washington right-hander was 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump, who lives in West Virginia
The President did not threaten to cite the situation that would be punishing his selection for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking on the importance of the Republican results in the midterm elections.
"It's at stake all we've done in November.
It's been five weeks from one of the most important elections in all our lives.
It's one of those big, big -- I'm not running but I'm really running, so I'm afraid I'm going to fight these great candidates," he said.
Trump added, "You see this exciting radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power away by whatever it takes, you see the confusion, the agitation.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to fight to get power and control, power and control what they want, and we don't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to "contend and condemn."
"And you see that for the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged and stubborn and lying."
She spoke by the name of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received strong public criticism.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
"No, ah no, I'm waiting one--that very bitter body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour, no longer a Broad Church.
It no longer accepts those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum activists vote at my local party to accuse me, it's no longer surprising.
In any case, I'm the ultimate line of Labour MPs who told us we weren't accepted--all because of revealing our thoughts.
My parliamentary partner, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was charged with a petition of censorship by disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, which is ironically the same issues that Jeremy would not have with previous leaders.
The reminder for Nottingham East Labor's Friday statement "We want words to be exclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's like the words GC every Friday night.
Today, it's not the tone of many words and has long forgotten the promise of "more understanding, more gentle" politics, if it really ever started.
It has become more apparent that it does not allow opposing views of the Labour party to be tolerated and that it will judge each opinion as to whether it is acceptable to the party's superiors.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the head, as my first colleagues began to look forward to seeing me as politically as I would turn around and take positions that I had never met - whether in the EU's national security or in the single market.
When I talk in public -- and it doesn't matter what to say -- there's a next generation of social media abuses calling for deletion, criticizing the politics of the above, saying that I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that wasn't the only experience I had.
Actually, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that were directed to me were politically inclined.
Ask me for the professionalism and determination of those around me to face a growing number of sexist abuses or racists every day but never backwards.
One of the most disturbing aspects of politics at the time is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should vote for a culture of acceptance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and that with every petition of "insecurity" or a change of rules of choice, the narrower the party becomes.
I've received so many advice over the past two years that I've been trying to bend, don't talk too much, and then, "I'm going to be okay."
But that's not what I wanted to do with my pregnancy in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, aroused by the negligence of Thatcher's government that allowed my comprehensive school classroom to literally deteriorate, I've worked hard to draw better public services for those who are in need - as local councillors or ministers.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
Nobody in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the positions of my policy and places of disagreement with the current leadership.
With the progression of the petition on Friday, all I want to say is, if the country goes into a Brexit that can filter its homes, livelihoods, and our public services, I don't understand the desire to enjoy time and strength in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But, in reality, the message I have is not in Nottingham Momentum, if it is not in my laughing person, whether a member of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of risk of decency or political exemption will prevent me from acting on anything I think is the most beneficial to you all.
MP for Nottingham East Chris Leslie
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ascent to the highest intelligible Ayr
The last two tests went too far, but Ayr was undoubtedly worth winning the amazing and comforting match against the Tennant Premiership.
They're at the top right now of the table, the only undetermined side of the table.
In the end, their extraordinary defense, such as their better chances, brought home side and trained Peter Murchie the right to be happy.
"We've been testing our game so far, and we're still not disappointed, so be happy I should be," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said: "The beautiful thing in Ayr is that they're better lucky than we are."
A try by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo in front, but a yellow card for Scottish cap Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors game, gave Melrose permission to hit and get a non-convert try by Jason Baggot.
Climo hit Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, right in half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to do it 17-5 on Ayr in the break.
But Melrose started the second half nicely, and a try by Patrick Anderson lessened, with Baggot converting only five points.
Then, there was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who brought out the strutcher, and from the restart, attacked the Ayr advance through Stafford McDowall's attempt that Climo had converted.
Ayr's ascending captain Blair Macpherson gave him a yellow card, and again, Melrose allowed the additional man to pay with an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of the struggle of fierce force.
However, when Struan Hutchinson's yellow card was handed to Climo without a ball, and from the penalty line-out, MacPherson went touch down behind the invading Ayr.
Climo converted, as he did almost since the arrest, after Kyle Rowe pinned David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanker Gregory Henry away for the fifth try on the home side.
Star of Still Game, seems ready for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game, seems ready to switch to the hospital industry, after discovering that he was named the director of a licensed food company.
The 56-year-old celebrity BBC show, which he wrote and contrasted with his respectful comedian Greg Hemphill, took place as Jack Jarvis.
The couple announced that it would be late in the ninth series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, despite the Scottish Sun's spokesman suggesting that Kiernan seemed to want to be part of Glasgow's "Long Restaurant trade."
'To us the sea': landlocked Bolivia, hoping to reopen the road towards the Pacific
Navigators patrolling a fleet of sea rigs across La Paz.
The public buildings were waving over an alley of blue sea.
The wet seas from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the saying: "To us the sea according to the law.
It's a duty to get back here."
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a beaching lost in Chile is still vivid in a bloody 19th-century wildlife distinction - such as wishing to sail back to the Pacific Ocean.
Those desires have probably been at the highest level for several decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the World Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of liberation.
"There is a sense of solidarity, and security in Bolivia, and it hopes, of course, with a positive outlook on this situation," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians observe the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, with hopes of extending the tribune to The Hague on Bolivia's request that -- after decades of very long talks -- Chile be obliged to cooperate with Bolivia's free flow to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native leader--who will face a controversial battle for reinstatement next year--there will be a lot of other things to blame on Monday's decision.
"We're about to return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some writers believe that the court has little chance of making a decision in favor of Bolivia--and little will change if that happens.
The UN constitution based in the Netherlands did not have the power to create Chilean territory, and it agreed that it would not make possible conversations.
The case means that it is "uncomplicated" based on the coming of the ICJ's decision just six months after hearing the final arguments, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on global law.
And far from advancing Bolivia's advance, it may have been disturbed for the past four years.
"The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric softened whatever the Chileans wanted, he suggested.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the conversation, but it's going to be very difficult to settle discussions after that.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivian- chaired The Hague, gave the idea that the court’s decision would be arbitrary.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance that 139 people who don't understand will be able to open up and benefit from the same example," he said.
Calzadilla also said that Morales - still one of Latin America's most famous leaders - was using the issue of sea as a political crutch.
"Bolivia never gives up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Counsel is an opportunity to see that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it manages to trust the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his country would never deny its nuclear promises if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He encouraged the United States to continue the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of rival nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly commented as he said that he would soon start a nuclear diplomacy again after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un three months ago.
Ri said it was "a dream" to bring North Korea to its knees by constantly waging sanction and opposing the U.S. in a declaration ending in the Korean War.
Washington is wary of integration into the declaration without yet taking significant steps toward the Pyongyang sandal expansion.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are both hopefuls of the second summit.
But there has been some doubt that the Pyongyang is serious about raising sandwiches that the country is likely to see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo planned to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
In Paris fashion showcased the latest line of huge headwear that was about to be released into a High Street near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or cover the sun, don't look for someone else.
Valentine and Thom Browne, designers of the SS19 collection's spectacular style set on Paris Fashion Week, appeared in a series of amazing headwear.
This summer, Instagram has spread to all of these impractical hats and these designers have brought their all-encompassing work to the catwalk.
Valentino's portrait piece is a really strange hat beige colored with a wide-brim clap around the heads of models.
Along with the other large wizards, a wizard's hat and also a pineapple--but it wasn't designed to keep your head frozen.
Thom Browne also showed a section of the most recent mask right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have Hannibal Lecter's lips and are much more similar than the haute couture.
There was a scuba diving gear that included snorkel and goggles, while there was another cone-shaped melting ice cream.
And if you keep up with this booming fashion statement, you're lucky.
Prophecies of style watchers, the large bonnets are about to be released on the high streets near you.
It was time for the huge hat to come next to 'La Bomb', the straw hat with a brim of two feet and seen wearing everything from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The culture label behind an extravagant impractical hat posted on social media sent another large piece of art back to the catwalk - a beach bag made of straw almost the size of a swimming model with its body.
The colorful orange raffia bag, which was plastered by raffia chirping and with a colorful white leather topped, was an extra-tanging piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacques in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: ‘I look forward to seeing the arrival of large hats and beach bags on the high street next summer - because of the size of the designer's impression, it's hard to ignore the demand for large accessory.'
John Edward: Language skills that are important to global citizens
Independence schools in Scotland maintain the track record of academic achievement, and it resumed in 2018 with the help of another set of excellent results from the exams, which was only enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community projects.
As well as more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are looking to deliver the best level of service to its students and their parents.
The goal of independent schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, in their chosen careers and international citizens.
As an educational sector that designs and implements an appropriate curriculum in school, we see that modern languages continue as popular and preferred subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone with the language he understands, it's going to get into his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, that's going to enter his heart."
It's a good reminder that we shouldn't just speak English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from abroad.
From the results of this year's exam, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest rate of transmission in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages got higher grades A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 percent of students earned higher grades A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students, also A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign-language organizations as a valuable asset that there is no doubt that children will need in the future.
Today's languages, as a matter of choice, are regarded as the equivalent of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curriculums of independent schools elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, employers found that because of the lack of language capabilities, 17 percent were given to employers for the difficulty of maintaining vacant positions.
Indeed, language skills are especially needed so that children will be ready for their career in the future.
Along with growing potential job opportunities requiring linguistic knowledge, these capabilities are vital in a globalized world.
Whatever a person's career is chosen, if he or she learns a second language, he or she will have a future advantage because of having a living ability like this.
People who speak languages will automatically have the ability to communicate directly with people from another country.
In 2013, according to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not have the ability to communicate in foreign languages and only French spoke in a percentage of two digits, which is 15 percent.
This is why it is important for young people today to invest in language education.
Having the ability of many languages, particularly in economics, will give young people better chances of finding a job.
In Scotland, schools are very diverse when it comes to languages taught by them.
There are many schools in more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK by the fourth year of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interest, there is always a choice of language in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this creation.
Independence schools in Scotland have learned to increase the risk of teaching that will prepare young people and give them the ability to succeed, no matter what their future may be.
It's unlikely at this time, in the world of global trade, that linguistic knowledge remains important for the country's future, so it should be displayed in education.
Undoubtedly, modern languages should be recognized as the "power of global interaction."
Independence schools continue to offer this ops, diversity and efficiency for young Scotland.
Il fait bien le fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to start for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
Hopeful waiters are waiting to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the preseason opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it doesn't even know how many minutes he's playing.
"More than a minute but less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James must have had limited minutes to play.
Following the first part of the week, James was told about his plans for the six game on the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need to play preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump will start campaign rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scheduled rallies the following week, including a visit to allies such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote of confirmation for his electorate is waiting for the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump intends to create support for the coming midterm elections because Republicans seek to lose control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rallies tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rallies online through live stream on YouTube.
Trump spoke about this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense about spending figures at the time of holding an expected Senate confirmation vote for up to a week while the FBI was investigating.
But the main objective of these rallies is that Republicans will be able to get a momentum ahead of the elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that these five rallies next week are focused on "acting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"It's important to control Congress for the agenda that a president goes to as many states as possible while we're on our way to a full-time campaign," said a Trump campaign spokesperson who looked like a name.
The rally was scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight and could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and get news coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Trump will be the third time in last month to visit West Virginia, the state where he has won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is on the ballot.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must go and try to get him on the ballot," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows courage to keep hope towards Sunday singles
After the three one-sided battle, this Ryder Cup might need the forecourts on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented concept in the sports field but is believed by players, especially at competitions like this.
So, according to them, where's the momentum now?
"They've only six points, and now they're four, so we're probably carrying a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving.
In Europe the sales, of course, were only four points left and twelve more.
Americans think they've got a little bubble and they're strong, because Spieth and Justin Thomas played together all day and there are three points from four.
Spieth led his side and stood him from tee to green.
The more the voices of the celebration grew as he took the round, he inserted an important cut to make the board into four matches after two downs with Thomas.
At the same time, she had that kind of cut that won them a match at 15, a shout that says it's not over for America's side.
"You just need to try hard and think about your own match," said Spieth.
It's all that's left for every player.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players who had more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the Ryder Cup legend.
Four out of four and no one can make the strange but amazing pair from Europe wrong.
"Molliwood" was the only pair not staying in the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also got away from bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back on Friday morning.
This bug, and how it's going to increase their energy from and to the hardest to see evidence that they're the players to be featured on Sunday, and there's no more celebrity player who can win the Europeans at Le Golf National without Fleetwood or Molinari.
If it's alright, join in a different hole.
But it seems that the Europeans' winning streak has been thriving.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of morning fourballs, to make them a pair of Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in front of them raised Spaniard and Swede, and they could not get up any more.
But on Sunday, there was nothing to help you get out of your hole.
It's fun to watch fourballs and foursomes close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they offer and they don't share, and the possible sudden change in strategy.
Europe's game as a group is much more beautiful now and they're trapped towards the last day but this foursome session showed the tide and strength of Team USA that some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe's 10-6 entry on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's only good entry on the last Ryder Cup day after it came out on Saturday from fourballs and foursome matches with only 10-6 against the United States.
Firstly, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molini's stable pair with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to take their tally to four points at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who hopes to regain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated against the Americans who were in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States fought more in its foreshortens, and won two matches but couldn't lower the odds.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from 12 singles matches this Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a great weekend, the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup matches.
After Woods and Patrick Reed joined the fourballs, Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau on 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who boiled himself in two matches on Saturday, showed short gestures of goodness but had received defeats at 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven successively.
Justin Rose rested for fourballs in the morning, and returned with her partner Henrik Stenson in the foremost match for 2<0x26>1 with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who ranked first and third in the world.
The sun hasn't been good for Europe even though it's cool and windy during the southern part of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans after scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a 2<0x26>1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned to match Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4<0x26>3 in the quarterfinals after winning the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned from four-point deficit entering singles, but as holders only needed Furyk's side of the draw to keep the trophy.
After two days of being second place, they don't seem to be able to handle a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says, 'bending-no' unilateral warning in distrust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the U.S. is becoming increasingly suspicious because of the ongoing inaction and non-unilateral surrender of their nuclear shields under such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world's representatives that North Korea will take "precious steps with good lions" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, testing of nuclear sites, and claiming not to make nuclear sandwiches and technology.
"Nevertheless, we've seen no corresponding agreement from the United States," he said.
"While there is no confidence in the United States, we will not have confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will never be unilateral to warrant."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's familiar complaints about Washington's denial in a "start-to-earth" approach to North Korea's denial of denuclearization while taking small steps, his statement made significant as it did not immediately reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang had done.
Ri addressed Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump in a joint statement on the first summit between the current U.S. President and North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to step down in the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's safety.
North Korea had been looking for a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should first give up their nuclear missiles.
Washington has also denied requests to reduce North Korea's restricted international sanction.
"The United States is reluctant to denuclearize" and raise the beam of sanctions to achieve their objectives violently, and they are also committed to "declaring the end of the war," said Ri.
"The vision that we grow up with inactions is a deep dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that we're deepened by continued action to question."
Ri hasn't mentioned any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president announced on the first part of the week.
Instead, the minister announced the three talks between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea and not the United States were the party on this nuclear disarmament, the Korean peninsula's democratization would not be a deadlock."
Although, the tone of Ri's remarks from last year was quite different, he told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korean rockets could not be prevented from targeting North Korea's territory after Mr Evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who thought last year that he was "very starting" North Korea, had showered Kim with congratulations for his courage in taking steps to disarmament, but he said that there was still a lot to do and that there should be more sanctions to stay until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that he didn't have time for this, and he also said, "It's been two years, three years or five months--no case."
China and Russia have argued that the U.N. Security Council should honor Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "Security Council actions should continue strictly and unmitigated until we know fully about the event, interference and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council stressed North Korea's efforts to reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program in 2006.
Pompeo met with Ri at the U.N. General Assembly's sidelines and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip has not been a good one.
She moved to Pyongyang last July, saying that there was a riot that took place, just to warn North Korea of her making "grave-gangster demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month that a missle site as well as a nuclear complex would be embarrassed if the United States took "measures."
He said Kim gave him the "equal steps" that he was looking for are guarantees of security that Trump promised to Singapore and a road toward normalization of connectivity in Washington.
Harvard students, take a course on having enough rest.
This year, a new course at Harvard University is helping its undergraduates sleep well as an attempt to fight the macho culture of studying throughout the night while running caffeine.
An academic found that students at number one university in the world are usually ignorant about the most basic ways to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a teacher of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She had the inspiration to start the course after giving a thought about the impact of losing sleep on the study.
"A woman came to me and asked, 'Why did this happen to me in my senior year?'
'He said, nobody told him about the value of sleep--which surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
This year's course presented the first time a course that explains to students the importance of having good sleep habits and how it contributes to academic athletic activity, as well as general health.
Paul Barreira, teacher of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to enter the course after realizing that students were completely asleep a week ago.
The one-hour course involved a series of interactive activities.
In one section there was a picture of the dorm room, where the students clicked cups of coffee, curtains, shoes and books to talk about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects being athletic, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how sleep loss increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
There is a campus map, with interactive icons, that encourages participants to think about their daily work.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know--such as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking," added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of having an all-nighter still exists, he said, adding that sophisticated technology and the increasing pressure on students is raising the problem of sleep deprivation.
Feeling that you have enough sleep, which has good quality, should serve as a ‘secret shield' for students to fight stress, extreme fatigue and anxiety, he said -- to reduce weight gain, as a result of causing a state of hunger mental deprivation, causing them to go hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helps Professor Czeisler design the course after taking his first year at Harvard.
She said that her eyes were opened and that she had the inspiration to pursue a school course.
He expects the next step to ask students to complete a study program like this before joining a competitive institution.
Prof. Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm when to sleep and wake up, and identify the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ that is absorbed by electronic screens and LED lights, which can block the circadian rhythm, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal breaks down Gerrard's team
The Rangers were again disappointed after Dolly Menga gave Steven Gerrard's son a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
Ibrox wanted to record their first win at the opponent's stadium after winning 4-1 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team won Gerrard's second in 18 games as manager, scoring eight points against Hearts leading the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and didn't even see the Rangers' line-up that was inspired.
As the Rangers come down to the six-point, Livingston reaches third and is just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And maybe there's even more trouble waiting for Rangers then the lineman Calum Spence had to give him a blow to the head after apparently throwing something from the opponent's side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the side to beat Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt used the same Livi 11 that held against Hearts last week and would like him to enjoy how his great group blocked their ranks on each turn.
The Rangers prevailed over the ball, but Livingston did more when they got the ball.
They had to score after two minutes of passing near Allan McGregor's goal, Menga's pass to Scott Pittman but the midfielder was already a long way off.
A deep free-kick by Keaghan Jacobs was caught by Craig Halkett but the defendant Alan Lithgow was unable to defend him by forcing the ball into the back post.
The Rangers, on the other hand, got control but the action seemed larger than the confidence that they could achieve their plan in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have been given a penalty kick in the close of a quarter of the game when he was hit by Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson posted the Colombian player's appeal.
The Rangers made two straight rags in the first half of the game but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't shy away from Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's nightmare strike.
Livi was able to score in its 34th minute opening even though the enemy looks better, unfit to deserve them there because of their graft.
Rangers reacted again to action against the deep set-piece of deep Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react that Declan Gallagher slipped the ball into the slot to Scott Robinson, who calmly passed Menga for a quick finish.
Gerrard reacted to the break when he bought Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and had the fast effect of buying the winger to slip over Morelos, but the amazing Kelly ran out of his line so he could handle it.
But Livingston continued to make it harder for the visitors to play the exact kind of games they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett's long balls were tweeted one after another.
Holt's side could have raised their only sexy moments but McGregor nicely stopped Jacobs before going to Lithgow's side from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another weaving for a penalty for Jacobs' offense, but Thomson couldn't look at it.
Almanac: The creator of the Geiger Counter
And now here's a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and THAT GLORY... the day Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany every day.
Geiger was working on the method for designing and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would capture the functions of a device called the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter was also a major contributor to pop culture since then, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," which features face-to-faces as cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, used to refer to radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you walk through these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms that radioactivity serves on minerals."
Evans: "I'm sure it sounds loud now!"
"Hans" Geiger left in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention stuck in his name.

Kanye West joined the Pro-Trump Diatribe, Wear a MAGA Hat, After her Exit from the SNL.
It Didn't Have a Good Results
Kanye West was cast in the studio as Saturday Night Live was taking place after a long performance in which he forced US President Donald Trump and said he was running for position in 2020.
After highlighting his third song for that night, called Ghost Town, where he wore Make America Great cap, he turned against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"Many times I've spoken to a white person and they say: "How did you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I remember about racism, it's been a long time that I should leave America," he said.
The SNL released a kit featuring Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star lauded Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Legal Execution Committee on complaints about the sexual press release of Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded a footage of West's footage on social media.
It's not clear if Rock told you to embarrass West in making the post.
Added to this, West complained to the audience that he didn't miss the backstage about his hat.
"They bullied me in the backstage.
They say, 'Don't go out wearing ‘that hat.'
They bullied me!
And they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Would you like to see the sunken place?" when you said, he made out "I put myself in superman's suit, because that is, you can't dictate me what I should do. Do you want to expand the world?
Try to have love."
Because of her comments, the audience voted at least twice and humiliated the cast members of the SNL, according to Variety’s report, and one person went to the publication: "The whole studio was in a state of silence."
West was introduced as an undercover shopping for singer Ariana Grande, who lost her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, just a few days ago.
West's performance of the song I Love It, which he got as a Perrier Bottle, was puzzled by many.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the best wishes: Thanks to the WORLD PEOPLE."
But Karen Hunter, West's talk show host, tweeted that it was "just a matter of fact and that's absolutely amazing."
"But I choose not to recognize a person (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "she") who I think is conscious of and expressing an ideology that permeates my community.
He's free.
And we do too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the one who is formally known as Kanye West."
She was not the first artist to change her name and follow Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The fellow rapper Snoop Dogg had the name of the former Snoop Lion and of course, the departing legend of music Prince, who changed his name and turned it into a symbol, and then became an artist formerly known as the Prince.
The murder of a manslaughter at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with murder and assaulted a man at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington said the masturbation
Kit Harington is known for his sword-skilled character Jon Snow in the HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, the stereotype of the brusque defender, said that such roles on-screen were directed to the frequent thoughts of young boys that they had to be hard to respect.
In a speech to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to address the problem of misconduct in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who was recently married to Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, 31, also admitted that she wanted to talk to the issue.
'It's not what I personally like right now--where are we wrong with masturbation?' he said.
'What did we teach men as they grew up, which is the problem we see today?'
Kit believes that television has a role-playing role in increasing the masses due to its inaccessible characters.
He continued: 'What's the nature and what's pointed out?
What is being taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys think they need to be like this guy?
I think that's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how do we change?
Because obviously something goes wrong for boys.'
He also admitted in the interview that he would not make any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ended the following summer, because he did, 'after him in the war and riding fields'.
Since November, Kit has starred in Sam Shepard's comeback story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently stated that he and his wife, Rose, recognized the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife in this movie, 'it's been this time with my having a family in the future, and my life from this,' she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, starring Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that won an Emmy award.
The two got married in June 2018 in the property yard of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports an increase of 14<0x25> in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were passed through contact, which marked a change from the past.
HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials in a discussion in Yunnan province.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS infected in China increases each year by 100,000 people.
It's a ugly issue in the LGBT community of China to get infected by HIV through contact.
It has led to the illegality of homosexuality in China in 1997, but it is said that criticism against LGBT members is still taking place.
Because of the country's conservative appreciations, it has been estimated that 70-90<0x25> of men who engage in sexual intercourse were the first to marry a woman.
Most of these infections are caused by a lack of protection from contact with such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the issue.
Maxine Waters presents her staff to distribute GOP senators' data, integrating 'critical lies' and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters issued a statement on Saturday that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia's pages to the plaintiffs.
The Democrat of Los Angeles insisted that "ultra-right when" writers and websites plot the complaints.
"Lies, lies, and a lot of false lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the report, along with the information released came home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information came online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill as a panel in the Senate held hearing sexual immorality threatening the Supreme Court's nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came a few minutes later when three senators examined Kavanaugh.
In the Hill report, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState revealed that Waters' IP address was linked to the source of the posts and provided the information of Waters' staff member.
"There's always a lie wrong and a lie that's this stupid figure," Waters continued.
"The members of my staff--who compromised the identity, personal information, and safety as a result of these deceptive and misdeeds--are nothing to do with the spread of this information.
Apparently it's wrong and a lie is this stupid figure."
Waters's remarks are fast-paced online, including the White House's former press secretary, King Fleischer.
"There's annoyance at this," writes Fleischer.
"It prohibited him from having the necessary conduct of a Member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be a fighter.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
He must be calm and gentle."
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' impeachment of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being too angry as Thursday's hearing took place.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to eliminate Waters from the midterm elections, also commented on Twitter.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In his speech, Waters said that he was alert to his reception "the appropriate authority and entity to enforce these deceptive complaints.
"We are sure to get to know the people who do," he continued, "and they will fight the law for all their work that they do and endanger everyone and all members of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Published spy poof by Rowan Atkinson
It's quite obvious that we're looking for Brexit in any new British-oriented movie and it seems to fit into the new version of the action-comedy spoof franchise of Johnny English - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and remakes the noise in 2011 in the Johnny English Reborn.
So it would be a new opportunity to export the country, so it would be easy to use oneself in a sense in terms of how remarkable our lack of information is?
In spite of all, the big-eyed and blurred figure Johnny English had a license to again cling to things a second time -- above all, his name suggests that he was a denial made for places where the audience did not speak English.
Of course, he was a mad secret agent who despite his recent allegations of being a very elegant character, had a little character of Clouseau, with Mr. Bean and was cleared by the passage of a man who contributed a note to the Chariots of Fire theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He was also originally the youngest of the traveler and international mystery guy that Atkinson had been assigned to the now-forgotten ads on Barclaycard's TV show, which caused him a lot of excitement.
There's one or two good scenes in this last JE show.
I liked Johnny English's approach to the helicopter while wearing a medieval boat and quickly hitting the rotor blades on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is reflected in physical humor, but it doesn't have to be so self-centered and overly funny, especially since he's confident that brands of "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible will add wit as an element to it.
It used to be the wit that this was intended for children rather than for adults, and for me, Johnny English's comic encounters were irrefutable and clear of the silent-movie gags of Atkinson in Bean's person.
The promise that has been around for a long time is that Great Britain is in a very difficult situation.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's highly confidential spy web network, revealing the identity of all of Britain's agents in the field, causing the agent to become disillusioned - a disappointing little piece of paper for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last thing to break the prime minister who was a proud and arrogant man, who was growing completely anxious at the loss of human support for him in politics: Emma Thompson discerned the occurrence of this late-Teresa-Some character but did not survive much from the script.
His intelligence chiefs informed him that because he had compromised that all active spies needed to be returned from retirements.
And that reference is to middle-aged Johnny English himself, who now works as a head teacher at an exclusive institution, but teaches private lessons on how to become an undercover operational: it's funny, because English provides a mala-School of Rock academy for espionage.
English was immediately called to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and rejoined the long-running offender Bough, whom Ben Miller was doing again.
Now Bough, married a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks paper on which Vicki Pepperdine was somewhat wasted.
Batman and Robin have returned to action with their Secret Service of His Majesty's Secret Service, and will be able to meet up with good femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, with whom Olga Bulletova played.
Meanwhile, the prime minister risks falling under the charm of a charismatic tech billionaire who says that he can put an end to Britain's computer riots: the villainous poem Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
These English and Bough began their long encounters with false allegations: pretending waiters, they started a fire at a French-style restaurant; they created scenes to ride unnoticed at Volta's huge yacht; and English started a huge chaos when she started using Virtual Reality.
There's no doubt that the matter was all fixed at that last sequence, but no matter how entertaining and caricaturing, the whole thing was quite a bit of a TV show.
It's not such a big deal.
And I can't stop myself from thinking about other Johnny English films: wouldn't the British film industry be able to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would give justice to his talent?
The Labour said that he was thinking of planning to have four days of work a week for the British but could pay them the equivalent of five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party considers a radical plan to have Britons work four days a week -- but they can be paid the equivalent of five days.
According to the party, the company's bosses want to pass the savings on to workers by giving them extra day of rest.
This will give employees the opportunity to have a three-day weekend -- but they will still be able to pay the same fee.
Sources say that the idea of a party's economic agenda and plans to favor workers is achieving.
The Trades Union Congress endorsed the four-day shift in a week’s work as a way to give workers economically in turmoil.
A senior source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: 'The announcement of policy is expected before the end of the year.
'It can't be done one night but the four days a week's work is an ideal set forth in the way of the party to re-balance the economy for the benefit of the workers and for the well-being of general strategy in the party industry.'
The first to endorse this idea was not the Labour Party, because the Green Party had promised to work four days for a week during its campaigning season for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the Labour Party does not endorse this ideal altogether.
According to a Labour Party spokesman: 'It's not a party rule to work four days a week and it's not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the talk of Labour last week to better explain his dream of revolutionary economic socialism.
According to Mr. McDonnell, he's determined to withdraw power from 'faceless directors' and 'those who push pipes' to utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies will probably not be able to get the full range of their stakes because the Labour government may raise up 'explosions' for potential misdemeanor activity.
He also signed plans to put workers into the company's coupons and fund the Inclusive Ownership Funds that will give 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees, which will have people dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy said in "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett ruled that the last vote in his nomination to the Supreme Court lasted for at least a week, and there was a question about whether Republican senators could withdraw their support.
In an umeere interview Sunday, Scott Pelley, correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything from the FBI’s potential findings that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his fellow South Carolina.
"Yes," said Kennedy.
"I told me I was going to listen, I said I met Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after ‘this, after the accusation came out,’ and I said, ‘Did you do it?'
He's inside, he's determined, and there's nothing to swallow."
However, Graham's vote doesn't seem to change.
"My mind is full of Brett Kavanaugh and a big charge is needed for more," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but here's what I know: Let's cry Brett," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And it can't confirm everything he names.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Does It Do Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an amazing lineup of star artists and a similarly awesome mission; the world will be free of poverty.
In this seven-year period, the Global Citizens Festival will host thousands of people gathered at Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy acts like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to gain insights for the real purpose of the 2030s.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that seeks to alleviate the hardship by increasing the number of active combatants.
To receive a free event ticket (not to mention if you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who come to a concert need to complete a set of activities, or "works" such as volunteering, sending emails to a global leader, calling to a telephone call or doing something very helpful to help spread knowledge about their goals.
But how successful is Global Citizen, who has only 12 years left before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of giving people a free concert to get people to act or just add it to what's called "clicktivism" -- people feel like they've made a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "activations" from its supporters, encouraging hosting for a variety of purposes.
These initiatives have helped encourage global leaders to advertise improvements and ensure that more than <0x24>37 billion will change lives by 2030.
In the first part of 2018, the group raised 390 increases and advertisements that began operating in it, and at least <0x24>10 billion of them have been spent or used to raise funds.
The group has estimated that the direct impact of insurance on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key claims are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and plaintiffs in the U.K. that is committed to "helping young adults who discover their full potential," promising to give Rwanda <0x24>700 million to help reduce malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4 million.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make a historical footnote to the lack of reason for social nutrition," said Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ullman to people at a live concert in London in April 2018.
According to the group, after more than 5,000 initiatives in the U.K. to reduce nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition practices.
In response to one of the FAQs on its website who asked "how do you think we're going to meet so much misery?"
The Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes, we're going to fall and fall.
But like our predecessors' big moves to civil rights and moves against the white withdrawal policy to black, we will succeed, because we'll be stronger when we're together.

The U.S. could use the Navy for "roads" to threaten Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy transport to the market, including in the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Zinke says that Russia's interaction with Syria -- particularly where it's running because of the invitation of legitimate government -- is just an offer to save new energy markets.
"I believe that they in the Middle East want to be energy brokers like they do in the eastern part of Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that roads are open to the sea and, if necessary, the space, to make sure that their exercise doesn't go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to presenters at the event led by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself to be a U.S. energy consumption listener.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that they are the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, involuntarily, to benefit and change energy," he said, while saying "Russia knows only one thing to do" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements are coming as the Trump administration is delivering its liquefied natural gas in Europe, which is a consumer in Russia, the far shorter option for consumers in Europe.
To achieve this goal, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany of misfortune with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has led Moscow to become a "controlled" Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the <0x24>11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is positioned to double the current capacity of the pipeline to be 110 billion cubic meters, is an economic project.
The Kremlin insists that Washington's serious opposition to the project is only pushed by economic factors and is an example of unfair competition.
"I feel like we can't use energy as a tool for consumers to push and choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak in a talk to U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view from Germany has been devastatingly reacting to its stand on the project.
Germany's major industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to refuse EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The problem is when other states interfere with our energy supplies," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"Thinking Good" by Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 presidential run, said the Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that running the presidency in the midterm elections would be "thinking carefully."
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our governments, and this includes a woman as a leader," he said, according to The Hill.
"Number 6th, I'm really thinking about running for the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump's speech, saying that he is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm really apprehensive about what Donald Trump is doing in our economy," he said.
Warren used to be responsible when he spoke about his criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's subjects were not convinced that he should run in 2020.
Eight percent of Massachusetts' "resident" voters said that a senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support this run.
The survey showed greater support for the running of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting possible runs and 48 percent against.
Among other high profile Democrats who have been talked about the potential 2020 run by former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would be giving an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin's PTSD attack on Donald Trump's PTSD
Track Palin spent a year in Iraq, 26, after enlisting last September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"When my son brought him back, I could understand the other families that had suffered the consequences of PTSD and some of the emotions that our soldiers had brought with them on their return," he told listeners at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "great problem not to talk about" and said that his son and other veterans of the war were "they're going to come back quite differently, they're returning to violence, asking if there's respect for anything given to the country by their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every member of the military."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence, particularly female violence, involvement in reporting violence in the family and assaulting the sandal while drinking, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports questioning the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Districts of Columbia support the legal questioning of a new U.S. policy that binds asylum to victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Voters from 18 states and friends-of-the-court briefing districts in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker, NBC News reported.
The full prosecution's name in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy will not be accepted.
He said that his partner had abused him "and the children of this violent gang," but U.S. officials complained of his request for asylum on July 20.
He was born in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are playing a large number of applicants for the U.S. asylum, as countries facing global problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy in the asylum overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Council of Appeals allowing un documented immigrants to flee violence from home to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia Attorney General, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy is "ignoring decades of laws of state, federal, and earth."
"The federal law decrees that all asylum weaving will be condemned in accordance with particular facts and instances of weaving, and that such prohibition violates that principle," said the friend-of-the court brief.
Prosecutors at the brief further state that the entry limits for immigrants to the U.S. economies are related to the fact that they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "twisted the demands for workers."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to refrain from asylum for victims of family abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is for those who change their country because of persecution, religion, nationality, or being members of a particular social group or of a political opinion," Sessions said in her statement to the policy of June 11.
Asylum is never intended to cover all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- which people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to remember in the Palu while doubling the number of deaths in memory of survivors
For survivors, things get worse.
"It's too nervous," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her eldest son in an evacuation center in the suburbs of Palu.
"In a minute an ambulance will come with bodies.
There is not enough clean water."
The residents were returning to their closed homes, picking up their wet belongings, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded, which was hit by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured rested, including Dwi Haris, who had a back and shoulder fracture, outside the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were rooted outside because of the persistent aftershock.
His eyes filled with tears as he asked how he felt the tremendous quake in the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where they were staying with his wife and daughter.
"There's no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck on the collapse of that wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, then gone, quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador accused China of being 'awesome' with 'propaganda advertising'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in a U.S.-China newspaper praising the benefits of the U.S.-China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday about the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of voting for the U.S. congress on Nov. 6, a statement held by China.
Trump's speech that Beijing is trying to interfere with the U.S. election was reflected in what U.S. officials told Reuters that Washington's recent campaign to pressure China.
And it's normal for foreign governments to put advertisements in place to promote markets, at present Beijing and Washington are engaged in a foster discretionary scheme in which they have exchanged lots for each other's imports.
China's threatening lots for the first period of political dynamics are designed to accommodate exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party, say experts in China and the U.S.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, said that Beijing has offended American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion column in Des Moines Register last Sunday that China, "today's hypnotizing by the release of propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"In the course of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's prized free language and free expression tradition through the release of a free press advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"Even in Beijing's newspaper stores, you can only see a limited amount of voices and you can't really see a picture of Chinese differences in the disturbing direction of China's economy, because the Chinese Communist Party has a strict grip on the media," he wrote.
She added that "one of the most popular newspapers in China will extend the offer to publish" this article, although she did not say which newspaper.
Republicans push women to stay away before midterms in Kavanaugh's Kagulu gift, Babala of Tagasuri
While many Republicans are supporting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of sexual abuse allegations, residents are worried that they will face severe reactions, especially from women, in the impending midterm elections.
Feel the emotions about it, and in most Republicans, it is evident that they want to continue voting.
Those things can't be turned away," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s support for the FBI's investigation to win the warped voters.
"Women can't forget what happened yesterday--they can't forget it tomorrow and not November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-ranking adviser and national spokesperson for the new group MoveOn, according to a Washington, DC, newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters listened to "November is near!" as they rallyed into the Senate corridor because Republicans with the control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic report.
"Democrats and motives are becoming unconventional," Stu Rothenberg, a political researcher, said on a news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it can increase, especially with swing voters in suburban villages and with young voters, 18- to 29-olds, who often don't vote, although they don't like the president."
Becoming before Ford's public testimony, who dealt with sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominees, researchers say that there could be a strong reaction if Republicans resumed the confirmation.
"It's been a big deal for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairperson of the Republican Committee, last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about committee votes or final votes or how to hug Kavanaugh, it's also about how Republicans cuddle it together and how they treat him," explained Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps defeat Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be coming out who is going to believe in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with more and more coincidences in the end.
A new survey from YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh had lied in her testimony, while only 30 percent said something like that about Ford.
After Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported by The Guardian.
Ford confirmed before the Senate Judicature Committee after swearing last week that Kavanaugh had been abused when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez presented him as having been nominated to the Supreme Court while at a party while they were still studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Developer Plans to Start a New Internet to Fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that runs between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest technology legend project, is a company created from Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to keep their data and what people are allowed to access for what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee argued that the goal behind Inrupt was "to cover the whole world."
"We must do it now," said he about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data stores or POD.
Here you can store lists of contacts, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
For this Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at once.
The uniqueness of the personal online data store is completely controlled by the user as to who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "giving itself power through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with methods, processes and skills that are appropriate to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is mainly developed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several on-staff developers who have turned against the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Since this week, technological developers around the world will be able to explore their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team weren't talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to bring about a complete change in which all of their business models would be completely reversed overnight.
"We don't want their permission."
In a post to the Medium that was published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission" provides commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web produced in Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet to present the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
As Berners-Lee, Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, will remain with the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very positive for this next time on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Klergyong wins the Victoria Cross in WW1
The only clergyman of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World Dimension as a warrior was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 at Bellenglise at Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had found the highest military rally in Britain.
A stone pillar left the cover of his two grandparents in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was a "bright brilliant sparkle" that exposed the rock that was 100 years old beginning with his grandfather's celebrated work.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion to cross the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in an overwhelming dew when bombarded with ammunition from field and machine guns."
Later, he would go into the first order and lead the advance with "the greatest bravery" before rushing out with a field-gun and knocking the three people down one by one.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I couldn't match but something humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also offered a flower banner after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that it was "the most famous part of the parade" and added that "the strength of the true hero is shown by the support that many people will give."
MMA fans don't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but Peppa Pig watches
Imagine, you wake up all night to watch the axle Bellator 206 but you're not allowed to watch it.
San Jose's bill contains 13 against, including six on the main card and aired live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their future, UK audiences were surprised to see that the coverage had changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they had been awake until the day they were ready to fight.
A Twitter fan said that moving to the cartoon was "a really bad joke."
"It's a government policy that at 6 a.m. it can't be appropriate to watch such a show and that they have to move to the show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's high-ranking vice president of marketing and communications, when he was asked about transmission.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator's company president Scott Coker said they're going to put together their schedule for future UK audiences.
"Whenever I think about replay, maybe we can fix it," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning there and we can't fix it until Sunday to us, Monday to them.
But we're fixing it.
Believe me, when they moved there, the tiny repetitive text and all of it angry.
We're trying to fix it, we thought it was technical glitch.
But no, the government has something to do with it.
I'll tell you that next time it won't happen.
We are not trying to make ourselves stand in the way we are doing. We want to help you to have the right to take care of what we do.
It's just a problem."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘down’ because of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that he grew older and less than others because of his sexuality - but that's what made him more successful.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't think until he came to high school that "it wasn't all like him."
While speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs that Lauren Laverne proclaimed, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that being an elder would cost him his own winning at the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, had been on vacation for months because of the illness.
In appearing as a castrated on Laverne's first program, Daley said that he felt "beautiful" than others as he grew up because "it wasn't easy to admit in society to liking men and women."
She says: "To this day, those feelings are lower than I am, and the feeling that I am different, the real things that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "other," said, so he didn't change everything that they first learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Bronze medal winner of the Olympics was a high-profile LGBT campaigner and this year he appeared at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries whose homosexuality is a crime.
She said she had said because she felt that she had a lucky face that could live without consequences and that she wanted to give others a "hope."
Three-besses world champions have said that love for a man - the U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - is what surprises me.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year but said that it hadn't been a problem ever since age.
"When you went to the Olympics at the age of 14 she first joined the Olympics and her father died of cancer three years ago -- she said that it would be hard to find someone of her own age who was experiencing the same happiness and sadness.
The couple became parents in June, to their son Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "broken vision" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, that's all, 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the gold medals at the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal."
Her son, Robert, died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die and that one of the last questions he asked was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in front.
"I can't tell him 'you won't come to sit in front of you, dad'," he said.
"I hold her hand as soon as she stopped breathing and as soon as she no longer breathes and is dead, that she accepts him without being smitten," he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze.
"I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life -- to give in front of people at the Olympic Games, no feeling better," he said.
It also became an inspiration to his first choice of songs--Proud of Heather Small--who looked at him at the approaching Olympics and still stood on his feathers.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays and 11:15 BST.
Mickelson won the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays at his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he needs to fix his condition to prevent this from becoming a sad event.
Mickelson, who is playing at the biennial event for the record 12th time, was hired by Captain Jim Furyk for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the midst of action, as it often happens to him for the United States, half five times in the major winner's time between being cheerleader and practicing in range, hoping to make sure anything would fall from him.
Since he has never been the most direct driver regardless of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited for the crowded Le Golf National course, where the wrong shots in the long rough are often a problem.
And as if the poor course wasn't enough, Mickelson was faced in the ninth match on Sunday, with the elite British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to beat all four of them this week.
If Americans, who have fallen four points since the 12 singles matches, will start hot, Mickelson's opponent may be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, since he had no one else to say.
"He wanted to understand his role today, hit me in the back and gave me a hand and said that he was ready for open," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
She's Hall of Famer and she's added a lot to these teams last week, and this week.
I'm not sure he's dreaming of playing two matches.
I had more dreams, but that’s what happened and that’s what we thought we were going to live in.
He wanted to be there too, just like others."
Mickelson surpassed Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup match on Sunday.
It can mark the end of the race at the Ryder Cup that has never matched its highest individual record.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 threes, and seven boards, although Furyk said his presence brought some unseen benefit to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, fun with people, and he's a good partner in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were happy with him too, this week, and it's a fun look.
He's given more than a game."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that big ones are just about to disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be lost and can be uncomfortable.
The Denmarkn began the 1997 match in Valderrama, where one side played by Seve Ballesteros as the captain of five hundreds of Americans but suddenly missed the finish line because of the margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You're always reminding yourself that we're just big at Valderrama; we're big at Brookline, and we're going to lose there, and in Valderrama, we win, but we're going to win," said Bjorn, in a picture, after the Class of 2018 was winning by 5-3 fellow Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and all that team that it's not done yet.
You give everything open.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not done until you put the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's how we try to build this trophy, where the focus remains.
I've said that I'm going to focus on the 12 players on our side, but we also know what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Glad to see his players spread to the poor golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't lead myself here.
It's another animal tomorrow.
Open individual events will appear, and that is a different activity.
It's good to get out there with a partner when things run smoothly, but when you're alone there, you're going to test the boundaries of your ability as a golfer.
Let the person who speaks for God interprets the speaker as if he’s interpreting it.
Now, leave your partner behind and he's going to have to ask for something and take out everything he can."
Like Bjorn, opponent number Jim Furyk is hoping to play his players better as an individual than as partners, including Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four.
Furyk himself was on the other end of big changes this last day, because he was part of the Brookline team's threatening defeat before Europe exposed "Miracle and Medina."
"I remember every word here," he said when he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, inspired his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches open, but you want to start as quickly as you can at Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the bubble goes in one direction, it carries a large amount of pressure on the middle match.
We're doing our line-up just what you need and we're pulling out the players because, you know, we're trying to do magic on the way."
Thomas was nominated for the game award and faced Rory McIlroy in the top match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter's other Europeans in the middle of the line-up.
"So I made this series of players because I think it's the best up to the last," Bjorn said to his selection for singles.
Germany's new warship has been denied
Germany's latest frigates in 2014 to buy in old warships since the Cold War, but it will not happen until next year because of systemic flaws and rising costs, local media reports.
"Rheinland-Pfalz," the head ship of the newer Baden-Werttemberg-class frigates, has been ruled that until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesperson said.
The ship had to be included in the Navy in 2014, but the major project was in trouble because of serious issues that would end with it being delivered.
The four Baden-Werttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be purchased by old Bremen-class frigates.
Evidently, they were equipped with powerful artillery, a range of missiles against airships and against ships as well as several strategic technologies, such as reduced radars, infrared and acoustic signs.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates that have been up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuing delay means the latest warships--which are said to give Germany the ability to display power overseas--will be old-fashioned when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The lucky F125 frigate last year made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to cross the ship and return it to the Hamburg shipyard Blohm <0x26> Voss.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the coast after it was deployed.
We know only a little about the reasons for the return, but German media outlets have criticized some of the "deficiencies of valuable software and hardware" that would make the warship useless if it came down on a combat mission.
Software shortcomings are especially important because the Baden-Werttemberg-class ships are being run by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workers of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship has come off too early in the morning and has reduced the Navy's ability to increase upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same type that the Germans used during the World War II.
Besides flawed hardware, the price of the whole project--including crew training--is also a problem.
It is said to have risen to an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) - from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the newest frigates are increasingly important because of the recent releases that have weakened the power of the seas of Germany.
In the first part of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "lost of ships that could be deployed."
The officer said the issue grew over time, because the old ships were removed but no purchases were provided.
He indicated that none of the Baden-Werttemberg-class frigates were comparable to the Navy.
National Trust Detects the Secret Life of Flowers
The goal of new research taking place outside an estate in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how lizards use the scenery in their search for food.
It is expected to illuminate the behavior of strange flying mammals and help guide activities that are concerned about the future.
A study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano cucumberelles as well as the brown long knuckles and knuckles at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Insert special recorders into key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the lizards over the course of the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers are also doing mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Skillful sound analysis on all recordings will confirm the frequency of the sounds of the shovels and will determine which species make the sounds different.
Then make a home map to have a more detailed landscape-scale description of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature management officer for the NTS, is hoping that the results will reveal which areas of residence are most important to the lizards and how they are used by every species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating parsery and what is the best way to imaging trees for livestock and other related species.
There has been a massive reduction in the lizard population in Scotland and across the UK over the last century.
They are associated with the construction and development work that affects nests and habitat loss.
Air turbines and lightning can also pose a threat, identify flypapers and some chemicals rooted in building materials, as well as attacks by great cats.
Hands aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting, their ears are more helpful than their eyes when they come to intercourse.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technology to refer insects and obstacles to the path they travel through.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 valuable gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, is important.
It has trained experts, who regularly perform surveys, inspect nests and sometimes shelters.
The organization also presents Scotland's first and only reserve of bat land on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bat in Scotland.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the property is the best territory for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great place for stoves," he said.
"We have old houses, many veterans of wood and all of the beautiful homes.
But there's a lot more we don't know about these things, so what we're doing here and in other areas will help to understand more about what they need to continue living."
She underestimates the importance of inspection for pre-store maintenance in realms, since accidentally destroying at least one mother's nest could kill 400 women and young lizards, which could cause damage to the entire local population.
Skies are protected and violated by the law to kill, fret or disrupt them or destroy their nests.
The Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, Elisabeth Ferrell, urged the public to help.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our trees and we don't know how many species we have in our population."
Ronaldo refused to accept rape allegations as lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape suspects against him as "reports," saying that some people "want to explain themselves" by his name.
Her lawyers were about to sue the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
The Portugal-Juventus Forward was charged with American assault by Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
While talking to an Instagram Live video on his 142 million followers a few hours after the news, Ronaldo, 33, said that the reports were "good news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
It's the bad news they said today," he said to the camera five times that he won the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to explain themselves by my name.
That’s normal.
They wanted to be popular, so my name was being criticized, but it was just a job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers were preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the privacy sector," according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said that the player would be fee-paying for "the morals of the weight of intrusion, which has probably been one of the most serious violations of the personal rights of those last years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga return to the player's room, where he rapes the woman, according to papers presented in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, knelt down on his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" and that he was a "good guy" that changed by "one percent."
Documents that Ronaldo had confirmed the two had turned around, but they both wanted it.
Mayorga also said that she would go to the police and take a picture of her wounds in a hospital, but later she would agree to an arrangement because she was "feared to reward" and worked "awful to the public."
The 34-year-old said that he wanted to change the order because he was still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged abuse, and this day he switched to Italian giants Juve on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: 'Long to regret' the UK's loss of car manufacturers
"Long regrets" for the UK if it loses its leadership role as the world's leader in building a car after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK said it would be "disgusting" to the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a treaty, it would take its production to Burnaston, near Derby.
"We must negotiate," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of delay on the border if Brexit has no agreement could be causing the loss of jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, which produces the Auris and Avensis of Toyota, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year and exported 90<0x25> to other parts of the European Union.
"I think if Britain were to leave the EU at the end of March, production would be cut off from our manufacturing," said Marvin Cooke, the management director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have brought out their fears about moving to the EU without a deal on how to achieve border negotiations, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what vehicle manufacturers claim to be the risks of a supply chain that exists without a Brexit agreement.
Toyota's production line is run on the "just-in-time" standard where parts every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for vehicles made to order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, there would be a delay in the border that the industry says could cause delays and deficiencies in parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to pile up more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so stopping production.
Mr. Clark said theresa May's Chequers plan for relations in the future with the EU was "well arranged to avoid such border investigations."
"We need to have a deal. We want the best agreement to make not only to see success in the present but to benefit us from this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"While the evidence not only from Toyota but the rest of the work, we must inevitably proceed with any very successful team of supply chain."
Toyota can't tell how long it takes to stop production, but it's disturbed that in respectful time, the increased costs of the plant's competence capabilities will be reduced and in general will cause unemployment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working for 24 years at Burnaston and his unite union convenor at the plant, says of his unconscious members: "With my experience, once lost, these jobs will never be restored.
A government spokesperson said: "We have come up with an accurate and promising plan for our relations with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's talks can be re-evaluated, according to the White House
Donald Trumpat's pivotal talks with deputy general Rod Rosenstein while continuing the problem with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, according to White House Sunday.
Rosenstein has been supervising the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, Trump's aides, and Russia's possible presidential threats to justice.
Trump has been talking for months about withdrawing from the deputy attorney general, and how much of Mueller's independence is being harvested.
In the first part of this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing the wire to record the Trump conversations and the possibility of deposing the president by 25th.
Rosenstein nodded at the scar.
But on Monday he would go to the White House, in the midst of the reports that he would joke.
Instead, a rally with Trump, which was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like to stop" Rosenstein but that he planned a meeting to reduce conflict with the hearing of a federal judiciary committee in the Senate that would challenge both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI prosecution against Kavanaugh, which was more likely to be delayed by a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders passed Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about meeting Rosenstein, he said: "There's no date set for there, maybe this week, it might be delayed another week because of all the other things that happen in the supreme court.
But let's take a look and I'll always update the press."
Several reporters objected to his statement: Sanders had not conducted a press briefing in the While House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the shortage of briefings was not due to a dislike of "beating" TV reporters, although he said: "I can't oppose that they're really being bullied."
He then indicated that there was a lot of direct connection between Trump and the press.
"The Q<0x26>A is doing more sessions with the president than before him," he said, adding without verbal evidence: "We're going to look at these numbers."
There will be briefings, says Sanders, but "when the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States for it, it's better than talk to me.
We're trying to do that very often and you've seen us do it more than once in the past few weeks and it will change press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepted questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Sole press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, in a show of inconsistency and sometimes in the face of reporters.
UN Secretary of Health writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health will invite the EU officials who are working with the NHS of Scotland to express their gratitude and urge them to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter that lasted less than six months until the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has promised to meet the value of state-of-the-art applications for EU citizens working on devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman said: "Last day, the conversation continued between the UK and the EU about leaving, hoping to have decisions this autumn.
But the UK Government has also limited its preparations for possible nonconformity.
I know it's a weird time for you all.
That's why I'd like to see how important it is to me that everyone, regardless of their nationality, contributes to me.
Partners from all over the EU, and beyond, are bringing important experience and skills that enhance and improve the functions of the healthcare service, and are beneficial to our patients and communities that we serve.
No doubt Scotland is home to you and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Deep in Emergency Surgery After Challenging Head Damage
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie in an emergency operation after the loss of a head injury on Saturday 31-27 at Vanderbilt Commodores, reported by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred a few minutes before halftime.
"He went to Sideline and fell just there," said Reed.
Abercrombie was given oxygen by trainees and medical personnel on sidelines before she put him on the stretcher and brought in for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that there are "no details of the kind of damage" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine where the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, was in her first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
She had five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought her season total to 18 tackles.
UK royalty bills are being charged with higher levels of duty
Guests will be charged to buy higher stamp duties when they buy UK property and use more money to help those who don't fall under the new Tory plans.
The step is an antidote to Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Show up on the UK's non-tax revenues
The Curse expects it to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the uninitiated
Shopholders are set to buy higher stamp duties when they buy real estate in the UK - and to use extra money to help the unemployed, Theresa May advertises it today.
Jeremy Corbyn's goal is to attract young voters with promises that will give them a home and target large audiences.
Show the rise in stamp duty to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and use extra money to support the Government's savings to eliminate street sleep.
The surcharge--which added to the current stamp duty, including the higher level implemented for two years that was occupied in second quarters and in houses that were bought for rent, may have risen by three percent.
The Curse expects this step to cover up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's newly acquired property has been bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices, making it harder to buy homes for the first time.
Many affluent places in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost town" because many strangers go out of the country most of the time.
The new policy came out just a few weeks after Boris Johnson suggested a reduction in the staff duty to help adults who were in the area to buy their first home.
She examined the large construction company for the continued high prices of real estate by buying the land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to lay quotas at house to repair the "infamous home" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an appealing series of proposed reforms to the house, including monopoly on rent and evacuation of eviction without "no reason".
He also wanted to give the councils greater power to build new houses.
Says Mrs May: "Last year I said I'd set my first post on returning to the British dream--that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means fixing the problematic housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have life here.
However, it isn't that easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to buy homes like the british resident.
It's so far away that so many people dream of having a home, and the lack of dignity in sleeping in the street continues to be a real problem."
Jack Ross: 'My ambition over all is governed by Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says that his ambition over everything is to be ruler of Scotland some day.
Scot, 42, appreciates the challenge to restore the North-East club, who ranks third in League One, three points away from the top.
He went to the Stadium of Light this day after St Mirren's return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was young, and there always seemed to be calling me back.
So, that's only when I succeed in running the club."
Among the predecessors of Ross as the Sunderland manager were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says that he's not afraid to follow those big names at such a large club, after rejecting the views from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The victory for me at this moment will be handed to 'May I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it's no doubt part of the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to bring it there, but I'll just think of myself as successful if I could return the club there."
Ross spent just three years in his career as an assistant boss in Dumbarton and 15-month-long coaching staff.
Afterwards, he helped Alloa recover from the dropping tier, transforming St Mirren from the shortfall to the winning title of the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he used to play at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a branch," she recalled about the rule in Alloa.
"I really believe that governance fits me, more than playing.
It was like a half-way, because my game was all right, I was able to make a living here, and I enjoyed a lot of fun for a while.
But it's hard to play.
There's a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I still carry ‘the stresses and pressures at work, but the way I handled them properly.
I've always admired the management and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable feeling I've felt for myself throughout my life as an elder."

According to the sarbey, 5:30pm Saturday is the best time for a pint
The hot sun raised the sales of the tough pubs in Britain but caused more pressure in the restaurant chain.
Pubs and bars increased sales by 2.7 percent in July - but sales in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to numbers.
CGA's business consultant Peter Martin, who joined the figures, said: "The continued popularity of the sun and the longer England's World Cup prospects were participating in July followed in the month of June, when the pub sales rose by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were getting worse.
A decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales last June has increased in July.
The sales of pubs and bars to drink the main goods, and compared to those two seasons, they raised larger than they were carried by restaurants.
The daily effect of pubs on which the primary food is not as good as that of restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out and drink.
In supervised pubs and bars, alcohol sales rise by 6.6 percent for the month, and food sales drop by three percent."
Paul Newman of RSM, an RSM study of Leisure and Hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and the effects of massive social events remain the biggest factors affecting the market advantages of those outside their homes.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups are still struggling, and sales by 4.8 percent a year will be even more painful if it increases the continued spending pressure.
It wouldn't be nice to spend a long sunny day for food operators and it would only be time to change the situation when the colder temperatures we've experienced in August come to us."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newer openings, is 2.7 percent in July, indicating a shift in brand emergence.
Coffer Peach Tracker, industry sales manager for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, has collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined revenue of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and this is the industry's base.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they do not tell their parents
One in five children -- some 11-year-olds -- has secret social media accounts that they don't tell their parents and teachers, according to the survey
The serbey offered 20,000 secondary-school students to increase the number of fake Insta pages
The news has compared fears of posting sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "food" account shown to parents
One in five children -- some 11-year-olds -- are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from seniors.
A survey of 20,000 high-school students announced the rapid increase in fake Insta accounts - about the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news compared fears of posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "private" account shown to parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who accidentally encountered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenage girl who urged other people "to rape me."
Research done by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit they have private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that lots of teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "boss for athletes" at Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was chaired on the board of Scottish Athletics as the non-executive director of the government's annual general assembly.
Doyle is the track and field athlete in Scotland with the most talented, and leader Ian Beattie has described the ultimate opportunity for players to benefit from her vast experience in the global scale of the last decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect for the sports communities in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we're sure Scotland's athletics will benefit a lot of them from taking him to the board," said Beattie.
Doyle says: "I'm interested in standing up as an athlete's voice and I'm hoping that I can really contribute and help guide the game in Scotland."
The Americans who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta with her four gold medals and are now regular experts at the BBC, unable to walk after having a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "It's been a month since I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said it was time that could tell me if I was good or what level.
It's hard work but I've completely healed, I've studied how to walk again and now I'm exercising to be creative!
Thank you for the internal messages!"
Have an opinion on the internet about the advertisement for the breast pump where mothers are compared to cows
The breast pump company shares an opinion on the internet with advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are being slaughtered.
In order to mark the launch of what they say is "the world's first silently worn breast bump," the company Elvie has appeared in its dominant sarcastic music video ads to showcase the freedom that the new pump will be given to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers danced in a barn full of straws with the accompanying lyrics such as: "Yeah, I dress myself but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice that ‘that's it, it's my winds."
The chorus continued: "I'll give you milk, I'll take your babies, I'll give you milk, I'll hold my boobs."
But the advertisement, already recorded on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy over the internet.
There are 77,000 watching and hundreds of comments, receiving videos of witty reactions from viewers, and saying that it overwhelms the dairy industry's "disgusting ones."
"It's really not a good decision to use cattle to advertise the product.
It's like they had to be pregnant and have babies to make milk, so they just kept their milk from being born for a few days," said one.

Another comment: "First-understanding traumatic for mother and baby.
But then why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are not far from their babies?"
The other one said, "There's no empty advertising."
Some people accused the advertisement, one woman admitted that the song was "laughing" for her.
"It's an idea for me.
I wish I had been breast-feeding.
It's like I really feel like pumping.
The advertisement was a little different, but I really think it was.
It's a genius product," said one.
Another commented: "It's a very exciting advertisement for mothers who have been pumping (especially in their workplaces or cottages) and it feels like cows.
It's not advertising that flatters or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women will reveal that all of them are dancing with subtle pumps in their arms.
The idea behind the campaign is to understand that many women who gather milk are saying that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no wire or tubes and enjoys in the nursing bra unexpectedly, so the girls are more awkward, they are more prone to embrace their babies, and they are even getting out while they are camping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD with the Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump has undergone so much change that it should give it a bold and exciting launch.
Comparing to these women and cows we'd love to call for milk and all the hard things about it, while demonstrating in a fun and early way the great comforts that the new pump brings.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump became the headline.
Last London Fashion Week, a mother with two-year-old children was going to make a showcase for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Old Little Migrants Quiet Moving to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained children migrants has grown even though the monthly delivery to the border is still constant, partly because it has made it harder for children to put in the sponsors of harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration.
Most often, most sponsors become undergraduate immigrants too, and are afraid to risk their own ability to stay in the country when they receive a child.
This June, when federal authorities declared that potential sponsors and other older members of their households should submit fingerprints and share data with the immigration authorities, they were at risk.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, appealed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor children without them.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrestees had no previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of individual sponsors or family members of sponsors are here in the country under the law, and a large part of these are gang criminals.
So we continue to bully those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have implemented new rules for them to appear in court for a month of decency, rather than 60 days later, according to shelters workers.
Many are faced with video conference calls, rather than personal, to explain their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for help are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in severe irritability or extortion, according to shelters and reports from the system in recent months.
Supporters said that those fatalities were worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be noticed, because of its size.
They added that moving children to a ten city without taking time to prepare their emotions or to tell friends can intensify the trauma that has already taken so much.
U.S., France and Turkey's 'occupied forces' have been told by Syria to withdraw immediately
While speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the conflict was already in the eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the banning forces of Syria's land, that they are fighting terrorism, and that they are "led as they ought."
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions," he said to the assembly.
Moualem insists that the "terrorism war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have to be removed from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting the sacred battle until all Syrian territory is evacuated" by both terrorist groups and "the presence of a ban on the law."
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian troops, mainly engaged in training and coordinating Kurds and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France had more than 1,000 land troops in the country that invaded the wars.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were fixed for them to return, and he sneered at "their neighboring country" for "spreading free fear" that persuaded the refugees to stay at a distance.
"We've called on the global community and organizations to speed up these restorations," he said.
"They're replacing the absolutely empty one."
The United States and the European Union are protesting that there will be no support for reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone on Idlib's last large rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political talks.
With the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a massive attack by Syrian forces assisted by Russia has been averted in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem acknowledged that the treaty was "clearly free" and expressed hopes that military action would target jihadists among Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, which he would "subject."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to bring in the first meetings of a new committee formed by the government and members of the opposition to write down the fundamental laws after the war against Syria and to guarantee the elections.
Moualem set out the terms for Syria's government's involvement with the committee, and said that the work on the panel should be limited to "reviewing articles of present-day commitments," and focusing on anti-discrimination.
Why Trump Speaks of Two Terms
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, except, as many liberals would expect, if his presidency would soon end disqualification and scandal.
In an unquestioning "President's dramatic ending ever!"
At present, there are no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings have increased more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled by 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, rising from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led the cable ratings with 3.5 million on big news nights.
"For this fire that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, running the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secret that became president after the Capitol collapsed in an attack.
Nell Scovell, a veterinarian comedy writer and co-authored "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has a different theory.
He remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? He asks.
"He says, "Because he laughs at me," said Ms. Scovell to me.
The chaos was exciting.
Of course, unlike those on TV, stories that grow in Washington can affect the future of Roe v. Wade, when immigrant families will be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Not to listen is a luxurious thing that can only be done by the best of eyewitnesses.
But it's more than a smart people when you're six hours watching a panel of experts who debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," in a <0x24>15,000 bomb jacket by Paul Manafort's description of the ostrich skin (something more than a sleeve), said The Post.
If I were, I'd look at Super Mario.
"He's doing so for this reality show because he's going to be posted something tonight," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the originator of "Pawn Stars," about the twirling cast of Trump's show and the day-to-day storyline change.
You'll be missed if you overlook an episode.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 80 degrees sunny outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while re-recording CNN.
He could not miss the show, especially as Brett Kavanaugh of the Senate Judiciary Committee was expected to appear and hang the future of the Supreme Court.
"I've always done these masterful shows before and people have said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Near civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External bill drops into the most intense congressional elections
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th, thanks to the change in congressional districts that led to two fights for the same place.
This recently threatened to re-elect Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won the seat in another district in a special spring election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently the representative of the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, where the 17th really meets the new.
The maps were reprinted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down in January that the old districts had turned red to favoring Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th initiated campaign funds between branches of the primary party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after winning a very narrow special election in March, which was widely watched for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
The Republican has held that position for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won by 20 points in the district.
Political experts challenged the Democrats for a little bit.
U.S. Balancing Suffering in El Salvador Because of Support in China, Then Back
The Dominican Republic and Panama diplomats have already identified Beijing, with a slight objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a nice talk with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners deposed the Trump Organization's governing body.
State Department officials have decided to reinstate American leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of "decisions that Taiwan is not recognized," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, in a statement earlier this fall.
But the penalties against El Salvador, which received a total of <0x24>140 million in US aid in 2017, were considered, among other things, for narcotic controls, economic development support.
The penalties, involving financial aid measures and appalling visa restrictions, are just too painful for the country in Central America and the high levels of unemployment and death there.
While internal meetings were on the rise, North American and South American officials deployed a high level conference aimed at security and economic development to follow the same-sex conference a year ago that was rumored to be an advance step toward preventing migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to resume the conference, which would end with any consideration of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak at the conference, which will be held in mid-October, as a sign of the administration's appreciation for the meeting, said diplomats.
And quietly, all three American orders will return to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a new strict message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton will continue to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who will ask to discuss the internal discussions on the condition that they be unnamed.
Their accounts were edited by an outside speaker near the administration and also spoke on condition that he be not named.
Learning the History
What happens next is a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible threat of justice, which now has a lot of evidence on public records.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller has today shifted his investigation into whether Trump's campaign with Russia has campaigned to attack it in our elections.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will be facing office in this branch, as he prepares to perform again, and perhaps in the future with a jury consisting of his coincidences.
A lot if that's it, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable--or his coincidences with Europe.
All of us on the Atlantic side have a lot of decisions to make that will affect how long the harvest will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had handed him over and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the next three years of crime.
History is going around at such points of change of direction, and the irresistible progress of democracy is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are facing some of the points of change today.
What should we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been there since the diary reported that last year, she secretly proposed the re-recording of the president and even gave speculation that the president could not fit the position.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the essay of The Times is inaccurate.
"How do we know if the recent F.B.I. investigation is incomplete or fair -- or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite the credible accusations of sexual abuse and lying testimony?
And more than anything, will we vote to midterms a Congressman who wins Mr. Trump?
If we fall into those trials, democracy will last for the winter.
But I believe we will not fall, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime and once joined my home as an ambassador.
He survived, going to America and, 60 years later, lit me the Sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
With that heritage, how can I be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic in the coming against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, mastering the victory over the Austrians, after Spain's magnificent board against Villarreal in the first quarter of this fall, puts them in a good position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans tried to get out of the season up to 2-2 boards in Villarreal but he believed that the Rangers would use that result as a daring target to bigger things.
"It's a great point for us because Villarreal is a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and came out with points.
Maybe we got it in the end but, in the end, the board might have been a good result.
Maybe they're better at the first half and we're the better at the second half.
Thursday, one big night in Europe.
I hope we get three points, but the game will be difficult because they'll have good results with the last game, but we're backed by people, so I'm sure we'll fight and get positive results.
Last year was really hard, in all that happened with my mistakes and changes at the club itself but there's a good feeling in the area right now.
The team is great and the members really enjoy it; the training is great.
We're hoping we'll be able to fight right now, keep up with the previous season and be successful."
Women fall asleep because of fears for retirement partners
Despite the fact that people who are involved in the sarbey have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, there are only a few people who talk to their family members about it.
About half the number of people in the Nationwide study said that they were talking to their wives about the value of respectful care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance business.
This is where it can start.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't get your family ready to take care of you unless you mention your preferences.
Talk to your manager and family to talk about where and how to receive care, because those decisions are big things that will be worth much.
Summarize your financial adviser: Your manager will also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options of funds for mutual protection may be part of the traditional insurance policy for mutual respectability, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help answer these expenses or ensure yourself with your own money - if you have any money.
Reduce your legal documents: Try to avoid legal problems.
Have a health-care proxy so that you can assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your preferences if you don't speak.
Also, think about having the power of attorneys for your finances.
You are selected by a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and I'm sure that your bills will be paid when you can't make them.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that you have a medical emergency for your elderly and that you're going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about drugs and allergies?
Define those details in a written plan for you to be prepared.
"It's not just financial, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the roots?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
You have to prepare that plan."
Man shot several times with air rifles at Ilfracombe
One man shot several times with the air rifle while he was walking home one night.
The victim, in his 40's, was at Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he broke his chest, stomach and hands.
Officials describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "sacrifice."
The victim hasn't seen shooting him.
His wounds were not life threatening, and the police responded to eyewitnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll was expected to rise.
Since the lines of communication were shut down, officials from the Donggala regency, an area nearer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were cursed after the vaccine took place.
Here are some basic information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay off the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 as of 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary after the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongggala is a regency located over 300 km (180 mi) offshore on the southern western coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region lower in the province, accounted for 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and planting are the main economic sources of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of it is in Morowali, off the coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck nearby Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific side of the Ring of Fire and regularly encounters earthquakes.
Here are some of the powerful earthquakes and tsunami that occurred over the years:
2004: A powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh on the southern part of Sumatra on Dec. 26 was detonated by a tsunami that hit 14 countries, 226,000 people died on the Indian coast, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of violent earthquakes hit the coast of Sumatra in the latter part of March and first of April.
The dead are old on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered by a tsunami hitting the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that rises 10 meters to dozen pounds and causes the death of about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing collapse and fears caused by the massive earthquakes and the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami followed this time, but more than 100 people were killed in collapses.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the remote tourist island of Lombok, where more than 500 people died, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Earthquakes have closed thousands of buildings and placed tens of thousands of tourists around the world.
Sarah Palin's First Presidency Arrested at Prospects of Family Harassment
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the onslaught of ill-treatment.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested for suspected domestic violence, for allegedly reporting domestic violence and for opposing arrests, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance called the police to report alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone from her.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility in custody for <0x24>500 unsecured bonds, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocence, sure" when asked his defense, the network reported.
Palin is facing three classes A misdemeanour, which means he can go to prison for up to a year and pay a fine of <0x24>250,000.
He was also charged by a Class B misdemeanour, who had already been sentenced to a day in prison and a fine of <0x24>2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been convicted in criminal cases.
In December 2017, she was accused of hurting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report alleged resentment.
The case is currently in the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 she was accused of domestic violence, attempts to report domestic violence, and allegations of wounds while drinking in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said Palin punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was first among veterans in 2016 after she linked her son's violent actions with PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Indonesia's Tsunami earthquake: old-fashioned
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude tsunami earthquake has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity broke down and lines of communication broke down and expected to raise the number of deaths in the days to come.
The earthquake struck near the heart of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulated on social media that showed just the moment the earthquake struck.
Hundreds of people gathered to satisfaction on the shores of the city of Palu after the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for suspects in terror attacks in NYC
New York federal prosecutors have sought the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a terror attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been complied with for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used the Home Depot's payload truck to carry out the attacks on bicycle roads along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, which would unite pedestrians and cyclists on his way last October.
In order to pass the death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "joyfully" executed the eight victims and "delighted" inflicting serious bodily guilt, according to the idea of intentioning to have the death penalty, which is set in the Southern District of New York.
These two parties are likely to be sentenced to death, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sworn in against Saipov of 22 completely including eight death threats that support oppression, commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charged with violence and motor vehicle destruction.
The investigators said that the attack required "great preparation and planning," and described Saipov's way of implementing it as "cruel, cruel and eel of the same."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused pain, loss and loss to his family and friends by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnicco," he said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It was a decade since the Southern District of New York was prosecuted in a capital case.
Guilty Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time that the death penalty was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to spy for the Soviet Union two years earlier in the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were placed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who lives in Uzbekistan, did not show condolences in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had the inspiration to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the completeness.
He also asked to display the ISIS banner in his hospital room, the police said.
He hasn't committed a total of 22.
David Patto, one of the federal public defenders to represent Saipov, said that they were "disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution.
"We think the decision to assume the death penalty rather than accept the admission of guilt for long-term imprisonment without the possibility of release will only sustain the trauma caused by these events in all the duration," said Patton.
Saipov’s defense against the defendants for the first time sought the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should oversee Brexit negotiations according to Tory MP
Nigel Farage vowed to 'disturb the army of people' now protesting at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the Ukip said the need for politicians to feel pressure from Eurosceptics -- while one of Theresa's MPs advised that she should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said in a march to Birmingham that the UK would have gone 'now' if Mr. Farage had been the Secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faced in order to reconcile her meeting was given a place of Tory favors to remain in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It was difficult for the premier to keep his Chequers compromise plan running smoothly amidst attacks from the Favors in Brexit, who wanted to stay and in the EU.
The allies insisted that he would continue to make a treaty with Brussels in the face of the unfavorable reaction--and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and the conflict.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'throw away the Chequers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
'If he had ruled, we would have gone now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I'll support Brexit but we'll have to throw the Chequers.'
With his opposition in the EU, he said: 'We're not going to fight global discipline just to be successive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone dismisses proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 election: 'The idea that Britons have changed their minds and they want to stay.'
Andrea Jenkyns, the Brexit's Favorite Tory, was on the march and said to the media: 'What I'm saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Don't want public affairs Chequers, don't vote on Opposition, it doesn't like our party and our activists who are walking on the road and control us.
Please, forget the Chequers and start listening.'
In a letter to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers remain in place if they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said that politicians at the rally need to 'feel the pressure' if they hope to change their decision made in a 2016 referendum.
'It's about trust now between us--people--and our politicians," he said.
'They're trying to look at Brexit and we're here right now to say to them, 'We don't want you to do that.'
In a message to the energetic group of people, he added: 'I want you to feel the pressure on our politicians, that Brexit is supposed to turn away.
'We've turned the people's army into a victory in Brexit and won't stop until we're free, govern ourselves, high-ranking United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay until Birmingham before conducting a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Activists were waving Tory Flags Against Brexit after the launch of the group this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a colleague of Labour, has put the Conservatives under pressure because of security issues they have led to a party app to open the conference.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can put IT systems and all the technology for Canada and so much more, for free fraud without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's just funny.
"There's nothing better than Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'think carefully' to run for the presidency
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said "think about running for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats discussed his face in a town hall in the neighboring part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against state chair Rep. Geoff Diehl, who is Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign leader.
He's in the midst of speculation that he'll fight Trump in 2020.
The event took place on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, with the format of the town hall starting from the moment Trump took his seat.
One of the attendees asked him if he intended to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was a time to "consult the women in Washington to look after our government, and this includes a woman as president."
He was arrested on the death of Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting and murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims hit a bullet in the head that killed him," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde betrayed his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson asked and admitted that he was at the scene of the crime, had a weapon in his hand, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team orders are given to him by Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear as soon as Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would play a major career role.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton defending his position on the first two rounds and urged Vettel to impose his teammate.
Vettel first stopped at the pit and left Hamilton going into the traffic at the end of the group, something that must have decided on the result.
The Mercedes pressed after a lap and passed Vettel's back, but Hamilton was ahead of him after the trigger where the Ferrari driver was willing to leave the inside of the free throw to continue to apologize after a double-move to the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the lower row of the grid and was seventh late on his 21st birthday.
Afterwards, he led most of his career as he continued to run to target the fast finish and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth.
Generally he stopped pitting on the 44th lap but couldn't afford to speed his run on the last eight laps while Raikkonen took the fourth.
It was a hard day because Valtteri had done a great weekend and had been really gentle and gave me something to give.
The team made an exceptional one-two," said Hamilton.
A Very Good Day of the Lord
President Donald Trump addressed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for alleging that he did not sign a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly replace the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "cruel and corrupt and lied."
"One thing that could happen and the good things that have happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and cruel and evil and liars," he said.
"Whenever you see the shows and what they put up saying "ah, I'm not doing that.
I'm not the one who can do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you the one who baptized?
Remember his answer ... did you baptize the document--"ah, ah, what?
Ah, no.
I'm not the one who baptized."
Just wait.
Did we... No, we didn't baptize," he added, while encouraging the senator.
Feinstein received a letter with details of allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and was baptized in early September--but Feinstein denied that his office had been baptized.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't delete his story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He said to me that I kept this confidentiality and that's how I made, as he asked."
But his speech to the president, who commented on Saturday night's rally, was not going to be a good thing: "I'm telling you, it's really bad body movements.
Perhaps he didn't, but ‘this is the most intense body movement I've ever seen.'
Continuing in his defense of the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said that Democrats were using allegations for their own benefit.
"They're determined to regain power in any way.
You're going to be able to get a grip on me, and I'm going to be able to get someone to help you," said the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars will win the Belfast Giants in the Elite League last Friday by winning the return match 5-3 for Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got only two early goals through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie shared the home side before Dwyer returned the Giants' only one.
Francois Bouchard pitched the game for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals.
This was the third win in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe, who started at the back of Dundee's 2-1 win in Belfast on Friday night.
This is the fourth appearance of the season on both sides, the Giants won the three previous games.
Dwyer's opener slipped into the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assistant, and David Rutherford gave the assistant a double assist just four minutes later.
In the off-season opener season, Sullivan returned the home side of the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt pitched Cownie's match at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants would take the lead in the first break when he got his second goal that night at the end of the first period.
The home side met again and Bouchard promoted them again with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen give Dundee only the first time in the game for the last part of the second period and secured the win in the fifth halfway of his team to the final.
The Giants, who are now three out of four of their last five games, will be home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Killed While Screaming Safe Earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was called a hero after he died screaming that an airplane carrying an old man would fly safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which was triggered by the tsunami.
Then, afterhock hits the area, and many people are trapped in the wrecked buildings in the city of Palu.
But despite his teammates' rescue efforts, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the maneuvering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu airport.
She left to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, was safe.
Then, he jumped into the traffic control tower just as he thought it was going down.
He died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirait said that the decision may have saved a long-lived life, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Back to Kalimantan to take her to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are pounding at this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may rise to thousands, because according to the country's disaster intelligence agency, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong have limited access.
"It is believed that the number will increase because more bodies are under the grooves while others are out of reach," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves up to six meters from Palu crashed into the lake carrying the hallucinogenic burials on Sunday.
Military and commercial air vehicles also carry relief and expenses.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance with bodies is coming.
There is not enough clean water.
Small shops have been robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross of Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is working to help survivors but we don't know what they will see there.
It's a tragedy, but it's still possible to expand."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I'm asking you to work day and night to complete the tasks of speeding.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was marked in the first part of this year by the Lombok earthquakes, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crashes into a lake
The Pacific-Swamp Micronesia airline now says that a man is missing, after first saying that all 47 passengers and personnel are safely transported from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that Saturday afternoon, a male passenger could not be found.
The airline said that it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find this man.
The airline did not immediately answer requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats help to save other passengers and navigators after the plane crashes into the water while attempting to cross the Chuuk island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in good condition.
It remains unclear what caused the crash and the exact order of events.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane would cross the lake and not reach the runway.
An eyewitness allegedly passed by an airplane on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very low.
"That's really great," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the other passengers were able to walk in the water up to emergency exits on board the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were frightened and screaming, and that he was holding a little punch on his head.
The U.S. Navy said that seamen who repair the harbor nearby would also assist in the rescue by using a global canoe to take people to shore before the plane capsized at about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in airline crashes registered with PNG in the past two decades but not yet involved Air Niugini.
Tagasuri threatened the timeline of the night that burned alive a woman
The prosecution concluded its argument on Saturday with a relapse with a man accused of having been burned to death by a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett, Tagasuri, is serving as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis for several hours.
She presented to the jury how she used cellphone records to tap the actions of 29-year-old offender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received data from several cellphones that showed that Chambers was with Tellis on the night of his death, as opposed to what Tellis had earlier said, a Clarion Ledger report.
When data showed that the man's cellphone was to Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford was a good person on Saturday and said he was somewhere else that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was what Tellis said about two weeks after he met Chambers when he died.
According to cell phone records, they only met for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis broke his text messages, phone calls and contact information on his phone.
"He attacked the maiden in her life," said Hale.
This last Sunday's arguments were set to start a defense.
The judge said he expected jury prosecution to come on that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious hip hop?
Three hip hops want to nurture a negative view of the genre by putting positive messages in their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, says that hip hop stays away from its political roots and addresses social issues.
They want to get back to the roots of it and reassess the consciousness of hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common by artists like Akala and Lowkey are revisiting the UK.
Black again?!
A NY aunt indicted a couple for losing her job after the "racist" text
A New Yorker woman sued the couple for the illegal dismissal after receiving a wrong text message from the mother complaining that she was "blame again."
The couple denied that she was a racist, and accused her of "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she learned that her children's new guardian, Giselle Maurice, had a black one when she arrived on her first day at work in 2016.
"INDIIIIIIIIII THAT NAman," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in her text to her husband.
So instead of sending it to his wife, he sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistakes, Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that her former nurse, who was an African-American, did not do a good job, and that she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day at work and sent home to Uber.
Currently, Maurice sues the couple for the job loss fee, and demands a fee of <0x24>350 a day for his six-month, stay-at-home job, despite no contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do it like that," he said to the Post on Friday, adding that "I know that's my prejudice."
The couple return to their racists, saying that the removal of Maurice from work is reasonable and that they are afraid that they will not be able to trust her after hurting her feelings.
"My husband sent me a text that he never really meant to say.
He's not racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
"But are you going to entrust your children to someone you're rude, even if it's inconsistent?
Your newborn baby?
It's not ‘no.'
While comparing the lawsuit to "execution," Plasco said that he was only two months after his wife was born and that the situation was "very difficult."
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That's not good," added the investment banker.
As the case progressed, the public quickly accused the couple on social media, focusing on their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not like talking bears, baptism of new mail
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's nice to know now what we know about Paddington's huge success."
He still trusts even to reject his work, he says of his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting inspiration from the little toy bears that wrote a youth book, and he added that the 60th anniversary of the book's totality after his death last year was "beautiful and sad."
He describes Paddington as a "precious member of our family," and he added that his father is proud of the success in the latter.
He's just quiet, he doesn't talk," he said.
"But because Paddington is real to him, it's like something your son is getting: you're proud of him even if he doesn't do it.
I think he feels like this about Paddington's success.
It's his creation and his imagination, and he gave it the honor he gave to Paddington himself."
I said good-bye on the phone while my son was dying.
When her child fell in the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried but failed to save her life.
"Call Nad to say that's really bad, that he's hopeless to live," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who was saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to him.
And ‘I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, son.
I'll be there soon.
I'll be with you.
Minutes after losing the visas and losing in his body the drugs that the doctor gave him to keep his heart pumping.
He died before it and it's all shut down.
I can't do anything but sit there and wait, as I know it's all happening.
I can't cry or cry because so many families and people came around me.
I need to do everything."
In the afternoon, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was distressed that in her son's journey, was in an airplane with other passengers--who were homeless in her lodging.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I was just stooping, not stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but when I'm on the plane I feel so sorry for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I know he loves the baby."
Troublesome women handling cards to stop handcuffs on the bridge
Two women, who lost their loved ones in death, tried to save their life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on the Welsh bridge cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis's son Tyler, 13 years old, began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't feel like any parent feels about me every day," she says.
Ms. Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her daughter with an infectious smile is hoping to become a chef.
"He's known all because of his smile.
They're always saying her smile makes her happy."
Just so, he left his job before he died, because "he was really very sad."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother saw his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it'll have an effect."
Mrs. Davis makes cards, "to tell people that they can go to and talk to them, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet - you have to talk."
Ms Humphreys, a friend of Ms Davies's, had left Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after her mother left.
"He didn't say that he was sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"Two days before Christmas we noticed a change in her attitude.
He was sadly sad on Christmas Day--when the children opened their gifts he did not deal with them."
He said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to admit: "It was a tremendous loss in the family.
We've been stealing.
But we have to proceed all and fight."

The next morning Brett Kavanaugh was suspended as the FBI launched an investigation
"I thought, if we could do something like what he asked--an investigation in a limited amount of time, the scope would be limited--to have even a little unity," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that he would "take-a-way" the committee amid party impeachment.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their apprehension is because it's all about time.
The midterm elections will take place only five weeks, on November 6th - if, as expected, Republicans don't succeed, they'll be too weak on their attempts to destroy the person they want in the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls the Senators, talks with them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through this he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI does its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to settle the tablet and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
As North Korea's "defector" falls under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors in South Korea has increased since Kim Jong-un took his seat seven years earlier, said a South Korean lawmaker.
While discussing the data from South Korea's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that it's a big deal of stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher levels of human offenders.
Pyongyang has not received any public comments.
The majority of North Korean defectors are offered in the brink of South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said that more than 30,000 North Koreans would leave the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the highest border in North Korea and is much easier to travel than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats the defectors as illegal migrants instead of refugees and often repatriates them.
These last months' relationships between the North and the South have turned out so much -- that in fact there are still enemies.
In the first part of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks related to the alleged negotiations of denuclearization.
It took place after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un's historic meeting in June in Singapore, when they agreed on the general agreement to support the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. initiatives for the lack of compensation.
"If we don't trust the US, we won't have confidence in our national security and in such a situation, we'll never be able to first disarm," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "very good," unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Lower Congress Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "too lazy" and said that because of her conduct she was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman gets that kind of attention, they'll say 'too good,'" said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very emotionally involved in allegations that she had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In her opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost crying on several occasions and crying as she talked to her family and her years in high school.
Because she also condemned Democrats on the committee, she called the allegations against her as "a harsh and coordinated public-purification" that was voiced by liberal outrages over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that she could not sit on the Supreme Court, since she showed that she did not favor the Democrats.
"I think he specially qualified himself for those statements and the way he pushed Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi reluctantly asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to check if he could confirm, and if Democrats would get a majority in the Low House.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the Congress or the FBI truthfully, that means he's not worthy not only of the Supreme Court, but also of the court he's here today," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, considering him a conservative judge.
In hearings for his confirmation, Kavanaugh dropped questions as to whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"This isn't the time to go to court a sloppy and sneaky person and say, 'That's not good,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Must Act It.
It's a fair blow, it's been months and years of anger, and it's not going to get out of it without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I think it's common, isn't it?"
She continued, "An executive in one area helped me a lot, saying that she was crying when she was angry, but she made a way that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm disgusted."
And he went on.
I think you're pretty."
Tears were allowed as a way of releasing anger because they were initially misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my earlier work, at a men's top office, where I cried with inexhaustible rage, was to burn me on the collar of an older woman--a nasty manager I've always feared--and asked me to go up a stairs.
"Sorry, don't weep at them to see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They thought you'd be sad and they'd make fun of you crying."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democrat from Colorado, worked for Gary Hart in his presidential run.
When, in 1987, Mr. Hart was caught comforting his wife in a canoe called Monkey Business and retreating to the front, Ms. Schroeder felt that she was really disappointed, that she had no reason not to think about running for the presidency herself.
"It didn't really make a good decision," he said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There are seven candidates, and they don't need another.
A man called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already started, he had been exempted from funding, so he promised not to join the contest unless he saved <0x24>2 million.
There is no fight that is won’t be won.
She discovered that some of her supporters would give <0x24>1,000 to men would only give her <0x24>250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he asked.
When he yelled and announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overwhelmed with emotion--thanks to the people who supported him, disappointment with the system where it was very difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and resentment for discrimination in the country--so he cried.
"You imagine I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder remembered how the press reacted to her.
"Think Kleenex is sponsoring me.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my gravestone?
"He's crying?"
How will the U.S.-China trade in Beijing improve
Beginnings of strikes between the U.S. and China are awful, and despite the long-distance end of the conflict, Beijing is likely to improve the gap between the nations in the respective times, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the US, issued the first statement this year by raising taxes on China's main exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week it's the biggest drop in new tapas affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of items, which is, in fact, taxing half of all US attendees from China.
Beijing wins every time, the most difficult thing is to take lots of five to ten percent of American <0x24>60 billion.
China has promised to keep the US in its every move, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not be ruined in the near future.
For Washington to grow, it has to give up on demands, but openly bowing down to the US would be a shame for <0x58>i Jinping, the president of China.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing is well established, US pressures to negotiate a war on respectability will be positively supported by China through a decrease in the level of economic integration.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic integration in either country, is more dangerous than any observer has admitted before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate in Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria's ready for the return of refugees," said Foreign Minister
Syria says that it is ready for the internal restoration of refugees and for the restoration of a nation that will destroy seven evils.
While speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions were developing in the country.
"The situation is much more stable and safe now thanks to the progress I have been able to make in combating terrorism," he said.
Rehabilitation is under way in areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore everything to normal.
There are all the conditions for an in-depth return of refugees to their homeland because of terrorism and for a socially exclusive occupation that focuses on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have emerged from the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
And six million people still living in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said that the regime in Syria is open to helping rebuild the collapse.
But he insisted that it would not receive help conditionally or with help from the country carrying the movement.
The Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and lost to Team USA in the final score of 16.5 out of 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has won Europe six consecutive times and hasn't been Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points they needed to score against the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson's tee-shot, who was struggling with the entire tournament, crashed into the water in the par-3 16th hole, and accepted the defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari glittered in all her rounds and became a 1-of-4 player to have 5-0-0 since the inception of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth won 5<0x26>4 of the lowest ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World's top-ranked player Dustin Johnson has fallen by 2 and England's Ian Poulter, who is probably in his last Ryder Cup game.
The veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, has won the tournament the most in all time with his 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but now I can't stop.
This guy's got to be hard.
So I'm grateful for Thomas and he chose me and he believed me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to help," said Garcia, who became emotionally successful in Europe.
He passed the role to his people, John Ram, who played the legend of US golfer Tiger Woods on 2<0x26>1 in the singles game last Sunday.
"I'm really proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A bizarre statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, he won 14 big titles with Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke out after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fight.
There was a moment this morning when we made Europe a little harder.
We fought.
Welcome to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
It's great to play all his 12 players.
We'll be together again, I'll be working closely with the US PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and going on.
I love these 12 years and have the honor of serving as a captain.
You really salute.
They're just better."
Red Tide Update: Decline of concentration in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in Red Tide concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the conditions of more patches of bloom were reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating a decrease in concentration.
The Red Tide's bloom stretches about 130 miles of coastline from the counties of nearby Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Patses can be seen about 10 miles from the shores of Hillsborough County, but a smaller area than last week.
The Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Relative concentration was recorded at or away at the shores of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentrations at the shores of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or away at the Sarasota County shore, background to middle concentration at Charlot.
Irritations to breathe in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier continue to be reported.
There was no such thing as an irritation in the North West of Florida last week.
