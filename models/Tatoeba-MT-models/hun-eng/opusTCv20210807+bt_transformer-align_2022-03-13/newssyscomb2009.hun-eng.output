Right-wing populists win in Austria, with a total of 29%
According to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday brought a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the so far Grand Coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial magistrate of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a winning return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
The ÖVP was even worse, which lost nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which has brought early elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖ, according to public opinion polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for allowing the government to fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current Vice Chancellor.
Observers believe that this could take place on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate the increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously won 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ had 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party agreed to joint government with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, it was removed from the BZÖ in 2005), which even imposed sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also reached Parliament, which, however, lost some popularity and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations may get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal beetle collection could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that some estrangement could occur in Czech-Indian relations.
This is what the Minister published in New York after meeting Pranáb Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, there would be a certain estrangement," he stated after the meeting, which took place from a Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr .vácha, acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, the jurisdiction of which is the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
However, according to Mukherji, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then you could apply for release on bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
“He offered an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him,” the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide the prisoner with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that the Indian side has already provided such assistance to them.
“Our main interest with India is to maintain the best relationships with many years of tradition.
The Indians acknowledge this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it is a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scholars,” he said.
Asked if the Indian party had promised to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
“I’ve made a lot of promises,” he said.
Czech judges fighting for the seabed
It enters the wall electronic map showing Australia and neighbouring maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with the adjacent seabed.
The area is the size of the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of staff of the United Nations Division on Ocean and Maritime Law.
His boss, Václav Mikulka, is a Czech lawyer, director of the division, who monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
There's a lot of work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources, barely known to date.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but they are also unknown living organisms, which can be the key to the development of anti-cancer medicine, for example.
Seabeds larger than land
Coastal states are now intensively applying for new underwater areas.
According to the UN Convention, they enforce their rights, which were agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1982.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of that country.
Such a country shall have the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
To put it simply, we consider that part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental pedestal, which is a natural continuation of the subsea continent.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, so-called exclusively economic zones," explains Mikulka.
The request, submitted by the country to the Commission for the external boundaries of the Continental pedestal, should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the committee has discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
Australia’s success in the world has recently echoed, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the seabed awarded to it by the committee has an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. six times larger than the territory of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting applications.
They can do so within ten years of the date of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental pedestal ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as a "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed, however, is not Klondike,” says Director Mikulka, exaggerating by saying that “some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually agreed upon.”
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
This is shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
Under the Convention, in 1991, like investors in some other countries, this organisation received the so-called "pioneer investor" status.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
"It can be harvested in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian member of the division, presents another example of a concretia.
It reminds me of a potato, or with a little imagination, of a parchment with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to solve the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the rescue of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are coming to light.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, the GSG 9, the German Federal Police's flight crew and the Federal Crime Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service were at the scene of the rescue.
However, according to Ministry spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostage takers allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
"This has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the rescued arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, they have not yet provided any information as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the Airbus plane of the German Air Force.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets by a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell to the bottom.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately attempted to convince the critics of the need for the $700 billion package in a dramatic operation.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called on the Members to support him, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state bailout could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after failure became public.
Experts expect further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Directors are registering more and more reservations.
A good winter is promised to German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic of bookings for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year - more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ desire to travel, according to the study, did not slow down.
In winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the research of the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings in the autumn months is already higher.
Travel agencies’ turnover in October was approximately 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agents and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States in particular was in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the rate of bookings increased by one third.
The Germans are also particularly popular destinations for Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as for domestic landscapes.
“Organized roads are the most sought after,” said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised travel is "more predictable for passengers than for individually organised travel."
Passengers can save money, among other things, with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists have undertaken travel compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Uninterruptedly repetitive ballermann hits, liter jar beers and design dirndli wearing celebrities.
It's a debut at Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I aren't exactly alike.
He's blonde, he's a TV host, and he's wearing a tailor-made dirndli.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my dress in the groceries.
But one thing unites us: We’ve only been on Wiesn three minutes, we’re already being overrun by photographers and filling their memory cards – it’s very flattering, and that’s all on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli fulfills its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by folk costumes.
But arriving at Theresienwiese, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirndli or leather pants; no one looks at you with disdain or embarrassment - everything is completely fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are just reaping my Dirndli apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I tied the apron wrongly: "You're free to the left, you're a virgin in the middle, you're sold out to the right, you're a widow in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from the back to the left.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others make less fuss about fine flirting techniques and wear a simple felt hat with the inscription "I'm too drunk to dress up" and show off their naked butts unwelcomely.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, stretching the "aaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone sees as garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the notorious "no urinators."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances go through the scene with an army and take care of the poor mists.
Nurses always appear in a team - four of them carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuffed.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarpaulin can't be seen.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics shouted to me at my question, and then in the throes.
Police named the victim of the accident
The police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood resident of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road, in the city.
He was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
Since then, he's been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed in neorenaissance style by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms with a tower at each front corner and looks like some German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little dwindled.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large-scale enterprise this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, with the help of this railway from Damascus to Baghdad to today's Saudi Arabia, wanted to achieve its ambitions to occupy the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railway lines were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station didn't get any better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the well-developed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has been slowly destroyed and history has far exceeded it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, it serves as Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon.
The Justice and Development Party in government - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah groups in Palestine, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of fussing, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the past of Ottoman.
However, the AKP, known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose - which stands in a developing suburban district, between semi-finished shopping malls and cafés. In the latter, the middle drivers in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been suitable for a right-middle-minded politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open up in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to be at a crossroads."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey's relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, figuratively speaking, all of Europe, along with Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East on those railway lines heading east.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched this decorative structure recover 100 years ago.
How they would have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus, it occurred to me that Turkey was once called "the sick man of Europe."
At that time, there was at least no question as to which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memories of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley, as music director of Guildford, has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
According to his musical plans for the part of the city, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could belong to the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape changer) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music they put in front of him - be it a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or accompanied by a grand orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often awe-inspiring and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it."
His conductor technique has always been completely understandable and accurate, but it is never dictatorial or exaggerated.
Whatever the level of music, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there ever was a leader who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well in the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past forty or so years, I have written reviews of over 100 concerts, but it has never disappointed me, and it has often enthralled me with them.
In Tod Handley, there was greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated those conductors who, in his words, simply "galoped through the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
Many of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25th), "He continued his studies in economic history in Oxford in 1946 and became a scholar at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute in 1950... while constantly preparing for the bachelor's degree, master's degree and PhD title."
This comes from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End" copyright notes, but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and in the meantime, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51 he was indeed in the USA with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 he attended universities in Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
You don't know why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
"I recommend J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" because his black and white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photographs, drew my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
True, the passenger compartment of its predecessor was already large enough, but the interior of the new model was even more spacious.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus Revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, a number of internal changes have been made.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed presentation of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was launched.
So first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less well-known, but it breaks sales records in other markets.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since its launch on the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million examples sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 it is estimated that 100,000 cars will be sold, resulting in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz units on the Spanish market, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate by 2000 examples sold in one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate Honda's decline in traffic in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 fewer than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be the Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, the United States would account for 50% of Insight's market share, while the remaining proportion would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launch is due in the first months of the year after the official Valencia presentation scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height, on the other hand, remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed on the one hand by the new body and on the other hand by the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo hold of the so-called double-floor luggage compartment has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that these dimensions refer to the 1.4 engine type, since the 1.2 Honda Jazz trunk has 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear LED lamps or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, as well as lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while at the same time the engine offers outstanding performance in all respects.
The power of the 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and its maximum torque at 114 Nm 4900 rpm.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and emits 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The "bee car" that avoids a collision
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has this time been inspired by nature, precisely the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the flight of bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center, in collaboration with the renowned Tokyo University’s Advanced Research Centre for Science and Technology, built this little robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology Public Relations and Research and Development, defines the BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-level safety cover.
The robot enhances the ability of the company's products to avoid collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety cover.
However, the role of the bee’s complex eyes is much more important than this, with which it can see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, the bee can fly undisturbed in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
In the 180-degree field of vision before BR23C, the instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid collision.
As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the currently available instruments is that in this case the avoidance maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In a way other than bees, the maneuver that takes place cannot be directed upwards or downwards, nor diagonally, it can only move in two dimensions and only towards the rotation of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, Nissan used a rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration in the robot to avoid collisions.
“This device only has to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabytes, but we're not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of a technology for immediate collision prevention, which Nissan estimates will be able to enter production cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may be possible to integrate the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to reach the end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of cash to invest, has no common sense.
Because of the crisis around their necks and the fact that Americans don't get caught up in the mazes of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's the "Bad Loans Hotel"... that is, the Galibas.
The sad face of the accommodation and especially the receptionist suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether the time for borrowing has really just come.
And especially where to apply for a loan, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is useful, but not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than the public.
What would happen if we completed the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear at the hotel.
In fact, it's something, because we don't even dream about buying a home...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in its capital to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's shares have fallen sharply on the stock market.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide a 10% return and have a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price fell by 6.79% around 17 o'clock in Greenwich's middle time, closing at $23.77.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a bank-holding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities, but at the same time it will be under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with the MUFG confirms once again that the current financial crisis demands even more caution from corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought the share would be made up entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid potential risks."
In terms of weighted average prices, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share decreases by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares one year later if the trading price of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period of time, i.e. it will increase to about $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from the MUFG can help you take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the group's spokesperson did not want to provide accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the association of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said its balance sheet had "determinately" improved since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of its insurance against non-payment risk has skyrocketed.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but it remained at a high level of around 12%.
Of the major investment banks, only one "survivor" remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had made $15 billion: part of it comes from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
Rebuilding the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas for the new constitution on Sunday.
He successfully completed his mission, as 64% of voters voted yes in the referendum, according to official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast unfilled by voters.
The draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote to be adopted.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling offices exit and a count by a non-governmental organisation proved the huge superiority of the "yes" votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke of the victory of his draft constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorians at their governor's seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report by the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the president.
The proposed constitution places state power at the service of the economy, maintaining the right of the state to "plan development" for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by emigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to dissolve the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the mandate of head of state in February 2009.
The constitution also included the freeness of health services and education. The president has already begun to introduce it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the living standard.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to Quito and Washington's agreement on the use of Ecuadorian facilities as a basis for American anti-drug measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
He was ambushed by an Egyptian commando on the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport, around 2:30 p.m.
The hostages were forbidden to report to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo’s suburbs, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers have "not been paid a ransom," Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in SUV safari. The group was then carried from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostage takers.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border guard and director of the safari organizer Aegyptous travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special commando arrived on two helicopters where they raided the hostage takers just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the leader who asked for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special troops were sent from the Lightning Brigade in Egypt to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service personnel and task forces,” he said.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
The previous day, the Sudanese army announced that they had intercepted an SUV on which the kidnappers were traveling during patrols. Six of them were killed (including the leader of Chad) and two were arrested.
The army claimed that the hostage takers were in contact with a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
Newspaper news and the ongoing election campaign are currently at the heart of the debate on culture financing.
We can only be happy about that.
But a part of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will speak up to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money used to manage small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government agencies.
Within the framework of the Federation of Historical Sociétés d'histoire du Québec, more than 40,000 volunteers of 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogy are working on the research of history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage with teeth and nails and protest with the last force of the drowning when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Part of Fortis bank is nationalized by Benelux governments
With partial nationalization, Benelux states help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, the first European to get into trouble because of the spillover effect of the U.S. credit market crisis: the three countries support the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments discussed the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition officer.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank has the first major crisis in the wave of international money market crises for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states buy up nearly half (49%) of the bank's existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year, mainly insurance.
Fortis shares started to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious crisis phenomena at the institute.
Analysts, however, agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company’s papers fell to a 14-year low by about 12 percent on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current share prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company directors, this is not realistic.
The management blamed overseas market uncertainty over the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers went up slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to head the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients so far, the accounts have not been stormed.
In Hungary Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the Henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that always links the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
This must be in independent hands, otherwise we will leave the henhouse to the fox," Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription program, said in a statement.
Insurance companies make the premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health status of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not take insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacies, based on the customer's identification number, he can easily obtain what medicines he has purchased in the last year and a half, and from this the program itself concludes what disease he suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, taking high doses of cholesterol on a regular basis suggests that you have virtually unmanageable high levels of blood fat, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some also determine a risk multiplier number, so the insurance company has little to do outside of paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some drugs can be used for several purposes, such as some compounds against migraines or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, not the former.
Separate companies have been formed to retrieve and process the data, and before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask for the consent of the patient.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies are now processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control the use.
There is a separate health data protection law, but its scope applies only to healthcare providers and insurers.
Before the Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities control over businesses specialising in data provision.
Dick Richard admits that this is not enough: therefore, he has improved his programme, which would require the data to be transmitted to the data subject's explicit consent.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot very much refuse the consent, otherwise the insurers will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are somehow dependent on the fox's goodwill.
Global Marseille menu
EU and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trade partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this topic, along with other, largely global problems.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be the main issue.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not pressed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. increase trade turnover to hundreds of billions of euros.
Given that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not a very ambitious goal.
In this spirit, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally agreed, i.e. air traffic can also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, has been condemned in all its forms on both sides and called for the UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate programme to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as the fact that a global deal should be reached at the next climate conference and greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to hinder the rise in food prices and support the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital, where he is about to do business at the bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they hope that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth 20 billion euros.
According to the news agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers will be represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair with a strong field.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the 60th Buchmesse Fair, the most important international copyright meeting.
This year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair will feature 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with a floor area of 171,790 square metres, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The guest of honor will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy a 264 square metre exhibition area by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Buchmesse's 5.0 pavilion, where there will also be an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
The plane of billionaire Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago, was found.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000 - metre - high plateau near Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, dismissed all remaining doubts: "After determining the position of the plane, we sent a team out, and now we can be sure it's the plane Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said that a few hours after the discovery of the wreckage, a commission of inquiry was asked to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s in Fosset's name issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was given up a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks by which he wrote himself into history.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he went around the world by plane without landing.
Many of his records include flying over the Andes at a height of 15,445 meters, which he performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, Shocking Advertisement
An unusual, but also original and definite hobby walkway with large surfaces and clear corners.
In a few words, this is the latest “compact SUV” from Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
Just because of this non-traditional content, the introduction campaign of the SUV GLK, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used by the car brand in Italy.
The billboard action, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the spatial presentation of the car, in which the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be visible in almost real size and three-dimensional form.
The person looking at the picture will feel as if the car is emerging from the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one to form a unified image.
There is no doubt that with this promotion Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will this attract the interest of prospective customers? We will see.
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably being expelled from the field.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are members of a group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never fought with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Trieste, and Udine.
These were joined by smaller sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were waved, on which the home town of the fans was marked: they were taken off on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team, the Levski fans.
The Italian Football Association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were named tickets, making it easier to check the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one who was being prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a football-related record were denied tickets and exits.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for minutes from the Sofia police, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots can also be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban on visits not only to Italian stadiums, but also to all stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that others will join this less than one hundred and fifty.
“We must immediately suppress this fire, we must not excuse anyone who behaves like this,” the Interior Ministry said.
So it's better to keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's national team match is coming up in Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a smaller cell supporting Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service will meet, and Tuesday, the Committee for the Safety of Sports Events, which can also count on a division of the Homeland Security Service, the secret services dealing with fan behavior.
"The chanting of Duce-Duce and the booming arm during the Italian anthem?
This idea was expressed, quite unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed head of the Ministry of Interior's observation service a few weeks ago (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to feed the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
I am not a sociologist, added the first man of the observation service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's also talk a little bit about the whistle of the Italian anthem: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it can't be called a good education..."
