It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been poured on me.
I slowly realized that I had misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.

This is dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we're talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.

Consequently, it seems bigger.
Looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You could use a shave.
Looks like you're not feeling very well here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It's got to be fixed.

Looks to me like you're honest.
Seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It's fair to get the same pay for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.

You can't breathe in here.
It is impossible to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's hard.
That's pretty important.

This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.

Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
He's not as crazy as he sounds.
It's not complicated at all.

It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.

It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring like it's pouring out of a tub.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is manifested in the defamation of the working class, exonerating imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it has provoked, and in spreading the seed of the idea that the innate aggressive tendencies of man are the causes of endless wars.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
That's really a big deal.

Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.

It's too dark to play ball.
That's expensive to me.
It's too hot for this.
Late grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's a typical autumn time.
Colds suck.
It's ugly, it's bright yellow, and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they won't run over in the dark.
It's under the table.

This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
This was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It was not easy to keep my promise.
That was a low-belt hit.

It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.

This is going to grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It'll rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
I'm having a hard time getting out of here.
It would be pointless.
This would have been better if it had already been arranged.
It is not courage, it is stupid.
