The Prague Stock Exchange went down by the end of the trade
The Prague stock market corrected its losses after the rapid fall in the morning.
The transactions with the shares of the Czech Energy Company reached nearly half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday from the beginning of Tuesday when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the fall.
This is how the market's reaction to the result of the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives is manifested in us, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Loss of shares in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although some of the losses during the day were finally cancelled.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index described almost 4% during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese shares, fell 3.8 percent, and markets in Shanghai were closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent of its shares, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange dropped 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
"The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, defines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and accept the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences of this.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, to which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion crowns) should have been spent.
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell almost seven percent, with a similar drop in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the House of Representatives was not adopted, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdraws: US government could pump $700 billion into banks
The Supreme Leaders of the U.S. Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance for the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
But there's no victory yet.
Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was reported to Reuters on Sunday by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee.
Senate sources say they can vote on the draft as soon as possible on Wednesday.
Economists say it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "soberization" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We took a big step.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the form of the package for stabilizing the market should be like,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat at the Bloomberg agency.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Saturday night to give the government a final form.
This should buy in unsold mortgages from financial companies, which put financial companies in serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
“We are close to a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
The correction plan needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Sign for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling violently.
Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada said that lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress's decision could first influence Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, as well as whether the trial can not be stopped at the last minute because of a problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law still undergoes a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at another $100 billion and later $350 billion if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush Appreciated Progress in Negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program remained, which was to acquire financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the bipartisan efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of severance payments
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called busy severance payments of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful to all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new instalments for mortgages it has purchased, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual aid
David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, said the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“This is because it is not possible to know with what mechanism and at what price the problematic activity will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will distribute losses among themselves,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it's not so important that the plan is approved now or early next week.
"It is much more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Match on the blade: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We will help you how to choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
This makes it clear that it is better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons for getting a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if his shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, he probably dreams of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue 8,000 kroner for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20 kroner market earphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide selection.
The life of the batteries also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than simply playing music, but also what most mobiles don't even happen to do.
No device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, calling and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera in it, and even navigate.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
There are also disadvantages to multi-functional mobiles.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends you to the charger.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, count on them not to play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even call here and there, get a charger at your workplace for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have this problem, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a small number of card readers cope without an adapter with miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
With some exceptions (iPod) players do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
Most of the mobiles and players already create a music library in order based on the artist himself, the name of the album, the genre, or, for example, the user's assessment.
Some devices only represent a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing the specific equipment, ask about the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If the music is primarily a background for you and you listen to it on the tram for a short time per day, for example, any mobile player playing MP3 will suit you.
Any cell phone can do that.
You don’t even need to pay particular attention to what music formats a mobile or player can use.
MP3 will all be dealt with, and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in the same format.
MP3 is one of the most common, and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices cope with WMA format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a compelling argument for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is crappy and usually limited to one-summer radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that such a method of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he wants to listen to something, he gropes his cell phone in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the earphones or at least the hands-free ones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, with which almost all mobiles, but only a small number of MP3 players have it.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand kroner, you can get quite a decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of output from traditional earphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones can cost up to 15,000 crowns.
At the same time, the advantage of players is, in addition to others, simple handling.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the treatment of the cheapest players (see our selection) really copes with everyone.
Minimal function, handling similar to a previously normal cassette tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of accidentally turned on mobile internet, nor in the form of a huge bill for data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, it can fit up to 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you belong to the most demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, thus approaching the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the farthest in the industry, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to 4,000 kroner, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here for us - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be that way for long.
On the website Mobil.cz, we have already written many times that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the TÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the other countries of the Union.
After the European Commission's latest move, regulation of roaming charges may result in a controversial situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound counterintuitive, since we have three mobile networks, and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Pavel Dvocák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has previously stated a few times that there is no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network may not have much chance (but it is likely that it would be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one more option - the virtual service provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant decrease in prices, to which classic service providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before big fish entered the market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, there were sounds similar to ours.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, we do not have to go too far for an example.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic is also the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need far fewer customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus usually appear at a low cost - they offer cheap calls and sms, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages that are at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it is quite a good move to bet on a target group.
This provider focuses specifically on men.
“Real men choose Mobileking – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether the same idea as in Poland can work for us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav .epick, doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic there is no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the discussions do not seem very hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studni-ková, spokesperson of the Penta financial group in his telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
By doing so, it indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try their best to avoid any potential competition.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not hidden its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which wants to take another step in order to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner, the better.
This possibility has been discussed again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe now is a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that we can be lucky for the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
“At this moment, we do not think that a fully-fledged virtual service provider has a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been addressed by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the press department of Vlastimil Sr.e., Telefónica 02.
The other providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, said: "Until now, we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which to build further."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up by the end of the year.
At the moment, we should have a specific agreement on the table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone focuses its attention on fulfilling its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav .epick adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable for our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build networks shared for fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - on a string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another provider would lead to an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and a decrease in profits.
So why do we make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When service providers are able to cooperate, the huzavona around the birth of U:fon also bears witness.
The biggest pressure on the T-Mobile was probably around the birth of the T-Mobile company's U:phone.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the website of the TÚ.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument as to why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been influenced by the market access of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be highly demanding."
In view of this attitude of mobile operators, however, the total lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just about the attitude of the TÚ, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a distinctive attitude towards the whole problem.
“The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," he said in answer to our question about Kristián Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Office.
A statement from the representatives of the service providers in this way would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, in addition, make sure that no one abuses their market position, this is more than strange.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile services."
However, it is likely that the ÚOHS’ interests do not include pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to see the quite touching consistency of the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Just as petrol prices at service stations are certainly the works of chance and hard competition.
The Office has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. they have a proportionately greater responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecommunications regulator as well," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the TÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, in such a market, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
Therefore, it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if this argument were not accepted, it should be a minimum warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a strikingly similar way.
In the meantime, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the already mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiating with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ÚTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunication law, the extension of the scope of the TÚ in the field of economic competition could not be carried through telecommunications, although many experts hoped for an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, of which many already operate in Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are their own mobile phone service price lists, which, however, are only partially public.
These are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-sale.
"If there were cases that you were talking about, it would be a breach of contract terms that we would be dealing with and that could lead to the end of the cooperation with the company," said Martina Kemrová.
But it is unlikely that the news of such activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned above may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider defends itself against such a procedure.
In fact, they have a significant profit from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not particularly threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not on their name, so they cannot have it fully as the general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what the Tú should be strange about.
In addition, there is another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why do they hinder the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to expose such activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classic service providers tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that regulators intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, either with formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are giving the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If a service provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it is difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be able to make more expensive calls.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the state anthem Where is my country on the day of the Czech State.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Ji aí B alohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solos, choir or instrumentally.
Kate aina Kn aínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah a.k.a. and Jaroslav Kr a.k.a.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Balohlavek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately selected young representative singers to sing solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of the clear diction, the clarity of the text and the harmony with both of them and later with the orchestra," he said.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first performed at the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's Tyl Fidlova
He became popular, and people spontaneously considered him their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the "new" anthem?
Prague transport company will also deliver a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
1 October 2008 Wednesday is the date in the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger enters metros, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save it on their chip card at the information centres and branches of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, M.stek, Nádra.í Hole.ovice, And.l., Roztyly, Let.any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka.erov and Luka.
From yesterday, coupons can be purchased via the Internet through the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who start using internet trading can permanently forget about the opening windows of metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand long lines for line tickets.
The coupon can be purchased over the Internet and the Opencard card will be saved in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a counter with trained servers who help those interested in shopping online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrn, spokesperson for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in self-service vending machines equipped in some lobbys.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket managers, and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them in the city right now, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Opatrni added.
The coupon is checked automatically instead of the driver
Managing the vending machines that start working tomorrow is easy.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the districts of Central Bohemia travel to the capital.
"On the Prague integrated transport trains, the guides were provided with card readers to determine the zone validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal from Ropid, which compiled the Prague public transport schedule.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the cashier at the driver's office.
Therefore, when boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at a specified location on the side of the cashier.
This way the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver for this," Dráp added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires can return to self-service vending machines that save coupons for cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudeten wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Sudeten Germans asked to be attached to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from the letter from the collection of the Southern Czech Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States of America.
It is said that with this wish some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also shown in a letter preserved from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the Southern Czech Scientific Library.
In the letter, the Germans of .esky Krumlov asked the U.S. President not to allow the return of "the county of .umava" to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
“We have understood the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops are not coming to German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter says, “people who have a heart for the fate of ‘umava.”
Since the attachment to Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans is supposed to give hope to brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the U.S. President to take over the protectorate "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinions of four million inhabitants, this area would be considered a foreign country to us, which would oppress and destroy the minority and contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors could not sign is said to be fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the President of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans of .umava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the county of .umava on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and whether they wish to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians believe that it adequately depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to minimally suspect that they would be evacuated from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others hoped that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in .eské Bud.jovica.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German in Budajovice in the Navy in the Baltic Sea.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into the prison camp in Holtynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war counted on being evacuated from the country on the basis of the Bene-2 decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
In Czech history, the most expensive action for road safety.
This could also be described as the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ale a.k.a., hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but it will also appear on flyers.
Drivers should be deterred from speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
He wants to speak primarily to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What appears in the advertisements?
Emotions are attacked, primarily by human stories.
This is also evidenced by the campaign’s “bloody” slogan:
You're not thinking - you're paying!
The term "don't think" on the license plate is written in big letters.
And in the pool of blood, there's the word "you pay."
This must represent that man can pay with his life for a moment of inattention.
The viewers are "frightened" by advertising spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be viewed regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let it go for the drivers
"The driver's 'pull it, let it go' system is valid.
For them, "let go" is when they go through the red, for example, and they save time.
The "pull" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kocan, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why the information campaign is needed in the press, especially the negative campaign, says the psychologist.
According to him, the signs that draw the driver's attention to danger are less effective.
"If the danger warning board is installed, it is likely that it will soon merge with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it," Kocan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmer, the president of the interim Israeli government, spoke about the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan plateau, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that he published on Monday the Jedi Achronot daily.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, territories,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without them there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to two July attacks on two cities, during which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places” in the Old Town.
“Those who want to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said.
Exit from the Golan plateau
Olmert also expressed an opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan plateau, which he believes is an indispensable condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not propose peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know well what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up their regular support for the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister said.
Questions After an Accident: Are Passenger Guides Illegal in Buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk in a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could travel in the bus on the way.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the flight attendant are in conflict with the law on transport activities," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of a truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, the least safe place on the bus, although there were two more seats for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
It has a role to play in determining whether the bus has a standing place according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places; this was confirmed by Radim Jan aura, director of the company to Aktuáln a.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this was withdrawn and we concluded that passengers could go to the toilet during the journey if they had their own seat," he said.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant.
“There is no clear legal restriction on the role of the flight attendant – there is no regulation governing this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds spokesman Hanzelka less clearly.
Josef Pokorn, director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in its registration certificate.
And that’s the end,” he says.
Buses may be urban according to their distinction, where there are standing places and limited maximum speed, as well as between cities with standing places and permitted higher speeds, as well as long-distance passengers without standing places and at authorised maximum speed with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
The transport safety expert at BESIP, Jaroslav Hocín, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
“In continuous progress, there are not many dangers, we can compare the situation to the service on the plane.
I'm not sure here when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, the physical laws apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be solved by the carrier with internal rules," he says and also believes that the problem has not been solved from the point of view of the law.
Jancura is ready to end the services
Student Agency offers cabin crew services as a single bus carrier.
It employs 200 flight attendants.
The director does not consider their occupation risky after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the flight attendants is risky, I will stop it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers on board.
That would also be cost savings,” he says.
In his vehicles, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants for safety reasons.
“We don’t have flight attendants, we’ve been against that since the very beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end in some kind of fatal injury," he told Taden.cz less than a year ago.
An incredible tragedy has happened
Two years ago, a young flight attendant from Plzec died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a direction indicator and stopped the bus.
The bus driver suddenly maneuvered to avoid it, but the right front of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved places for the rest of the flight attendants would have been sold is rejected by Jan aura.
"These places can't be booked on long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but expects financial compensation from the offender.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movement of flight attendants on board the bus could be reported by the amendment of the law, which has been working for more than a year by the 30 experts group of the Ministry of Transport.
"But the group has not achieved any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system on the motorway deals with the maximum permissible speed and mobile use while driving," says expert Ho aín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the flight attendants to be something that would fundamentally threaten the safety of passengers," Hanzelka, a spokesman, concluded by saying that the control of bus safety falls within the competence of the police and labour offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB's board of directors to the bank's staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger of the assets of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create a "central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group", the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a link could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of when a board of directors wants to prove its capacity to act in difficult times.
After all, the insecure WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the provincial government of North Rhine-Westphalia that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was tight.
For savings bank clients, however, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, famous for its investment funds, has been a topic for a long time - also from Frankfurt.
As early as the end of August, Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, informed him that the merger of the bank on Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not make sense.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which consists of representatives of the provincial banks and the other half of the savings bank associations, commissioned the Board of Directors to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
However, the negotiations, according to financial circles, have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, Deca-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first time that the name of Deka-Bank has arisen in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to unite with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, this threefold alliance did not turn out to be anything.
The plans were hardly published, and the Hessen Provincial Government spoke against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need to approach different banks in the public sector.
Now, after the provincial elections in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg will be the first to have a relationship.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, potential partners may slowly run out for him.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger business partner, even though he has survived the financial crisis significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with an 85% stake in Helaba, at the beginning of the year.
NordLB will be left without a better one.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and Jury Association had not yet answered the decisive question about the business model to ensure the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is possible to dismember WestLB, which, of course, is not required there.
Thus, the letter from the board there also explains that they are definitely looking for a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the union of individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian Weekend"
This is Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-branded five-litre barrel, there is a man with a strong beard, and he insists to some 200 people on Oktoberfest that he can draw deep sounds out of his throat.
Elena first flashes Luca's face, then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, four buses depart from the car park near Puorta Nuova train station at 23.45 p.m. with the destination "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, and in the fourth one only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were singing next to their flag, and they started celebrating during the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long, artificial fur coat and wide silvery - stem glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only organized three trips this year.
At night there, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 22.30 a.m. home.
Accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian beer purity law, accident insurance and German language guide - Marco completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already throwing themselves into the night on the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus will soon be quiet, the passengers will sleep.
That's okay, they're gonna need their strength.
A rest stop is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on Highway 8 many Italian buses take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 p.m., there are nearly 50 other buses coming from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving one last briefing, presenting the battle plan.
First of all, put on the yellow hat.
On the left side is the inscription "Oktoberfest" written in fractural letters, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the gates of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, for we shall be stuck, and not all the yellow hats shall sit on the same benches, but let us be scattered in the tent."
The one-litre pint costs 8,25 euros, Marco screams.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you behaved well.
As soon as you leave your place, they will take it.”
Third, "Be back here tonight at 11:30 sharp." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wies.
On the way, one of the men binds yellow hats to the trees, to the signs, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bavarian People's Party.
You have to be prepared for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people are talking about crossing the Alps in the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors to the weekend are said to be coming from Italy.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which in its national statistics takes the first place with some 200 medical care, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbrau beer tent is particularly popular.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word "relatively" and even included the fact that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because that happened this weekend.
The real estate finance company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Munich has received a billion-dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person who knows the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit subsidies amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
Depfa, a state finance company, has lent money to long-term projects and has refinanced itself to an extremely short maturity - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves fell by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity declined moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash transactions fell to zero compared to the same period in the previous year, revenues from credit to receivables and specific securities and the liquidation of provisions in the credit business decreased by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post settlement costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the levy regulation and the shops for the companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively moderate revenue deficit of around 16%.
After privatisation in 1990, the former State Funder first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
Since classical state funding was low, Depfa was more involved in infrastructure projects, as well as in joint projects between private investors and the State (private-public partnership, PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now needs to make descriptions that have a "substantial impact" on the group's profit and loss account, it has been reported quite generally.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
Dividends have already been reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funder since Depfa was taken over.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions because it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending of banks to each other has dried up as banks retain their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinance part of Depfa’s loan portfolio, some EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered for the foreseeable period of time with the loan, and the company is protected from "the influence of international financial markets that are currently highly dysfunctional."
According to other sources, thanks to the money, refinancing is ensured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now assured.
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and incalculability of the crisis, they cannot be sure of it.
It is not even inconceivable that you do not have to make full use of the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Saturday’s late-night news that the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not calm the moods.
The share price fell by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite good.
While the first-ranked debts hardly change, the exchange rates of the back-ordered bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as a matter of fact, the maturity beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds previously seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their value stability should now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system due to the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis home with the takeover of Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start from the timely repayment of annuities.
Or it will happen, which almost no one at the moment dares hope to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports of partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become merely legitimate hope.
For long-term lenders, the decision to give up their investment can cause sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors can use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange rate gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inside Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop at Tachibana Highschool has to introduce herself on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German chick is completely "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange student blog she talks about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschooli.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start to squawk from eight o'clock until a short conversation with the teacher at 8:40 p.m., the "home room".
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my hostess, a blouse, blue knee stockings, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the caterpillar in this dress and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I came from Germany, and in a week my birthday will be.
At the moment, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering, giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I knew that from my manga.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
Then I quickly swung to my place.
The girl next to me smiled wide, and she felt honored to be placed next to the exchange student.
The rest of the clock was quite calm, but when the bell sounded, they ran properly.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and with their questions, they drilled a hole in my stomach - even though it is quite difficult to understand the Englishness of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their Bentos.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, salads made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of tofu wrapped in meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe with the exception of salty plums, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, Bento is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which she makes especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can see that here.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it just fascinates me."
After all, I've been reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comic books and the culture described in them, at some point I began to learn Japanese.
It was clear to me that I would have to go there sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are highly valued here.
Japan is, on the one hand, a country of the latest techniques and trends - and, on the other hand, strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life."
Rats have emotions, too.
A rat or a moth escapes in the event of danger. Does this mean that you feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the online journal "Edge", famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of its series is looking at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brains is the same.
However, as we look at other species and dissect the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same as many other animals: he pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to transfer our own subjective experiences to those of animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/control functions).
This broad area is more advanced in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other living beings.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the awareness of who we are, or in the case of design and decision-making ability, it can be reasonably assumed that man is different from even other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if it were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then its research will bring us serious problems.
Most of my discussions refer to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in the assumption examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualisation.
What does this mean for emotions?
This is due to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies a working memory.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially of humans.
In addition to language, perception is divided into fine degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states to describe them to others as well as ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the cortex and body perception areas of the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions surrounding species.
I can't deny it purely theoretically, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans in both cases is likely to feel: How can we check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in the same way?
A cockroach flees in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparisons continue to help: rats and humans have similar brainstems, cockroaches don't have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proved in terms of humans, how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I research the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level if the same is measured in rats and humans.
Just as I don't research language and consciousness in rats, I don't research emotions because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a short-sighted attitude to someone else, but I'd rather move forward than constantly bump into a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A Time of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees confidence in Ukraine in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux and its belief that Ukraine, together with Poland, can organise the European Championship,” Vaszjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries."
With regard to the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind.
It is possible to reduce the number of EB stadiums from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time.”
In Poland, they took an even more radical step.
After a number of scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN alliance, which was replaced by independent supervisory commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that this would not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Commission.”
Only in the last season, several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulation, and finally the league start had to be postponed.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she's having a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan, a Hollywood star, classified her former husband Dennis Quaide as an adulterer.
The one who fights - and fights back
War of Delayed Roses with ex-husband Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors fight each other in public seven years after their divorce.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan said for the first time last week about the causes of the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him with.
The spiritual striptease took place because of Ryan's new press work on his film "The Women", which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to his call to an unfaithful husband: "It's terrible," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News newspaper, "that Meg is boringly repeating and spending the story of our relationship."
In addition, it is “regrettable” that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly “publicly reminded of the many pains and changes that divorce causes a child.”
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a twin.
So his answer ends with the following page: "My life will continue anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family in which everything is all right."
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
Prices for flights and hotel rooms have again become more favourable, thus summarising the results of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed the booking data for the first half of 2008, and after the price increase in the first quarter, it found a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After years of increasing prices on the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices rose by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly seen in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to "the ease of travel for American tourists".
The decrease in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in airline ticket prices in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2%.
Between April and June, prices of tourist-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but prices in business and first class showed only a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent and decreased by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany has halved.
The reason for the price decline lies, on the one hand, in the decreasing economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the USA and Europe, strengthens the pressure exerted by the competitive situation.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their loss-making flights, and a number of airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe are affected.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
Hamburger SV came to the top of the table with a goal and simple methods.
At Borussia, Luhukay still can't find the working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only in the game late, and his raise bounced back from the gate.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger was HSV's physical therapist for nearly three decades, with more authority than some former players.
So his request was heard in the competent place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of the Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His command must have been the same: Give me the second goal!
The order was not executed.
"It wasn't always a beautiful sight today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt was more relaxed about it.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) goal result is due to the head of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which represented their team as the top of the championship class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
“We know where to put it,” said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself thanks to its lately committed compositions - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen acquired from FC Bayern - but it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and ruse," Jol demanded.
After the vote
Wall Street is filled with fear.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow became somewhat stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer was a good 5 percent minus and stood at 10,579 points.
The technology paper trader Nasdaq fell to 1548 points with more than seven percent minus.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a loss of 14%, followed by Bank of America with 12 percent.
Not a single piece of paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs Bank shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier, Warren Buffett, a major investor, bought a stake in the bank.
In the framework of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage papers.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the state would receive the vouchers of the financial institutions' stock options, which could be effective in the event of the appropriate development of the exchange rates, reducing the burden on the state budget.
European and U.S. and stock prices in decline
Billionaire aid to European and American banks does not dispel the doubts of investors.
The stock price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and taking Dax with it.
The American Dow Jones indicator declines despite the state's planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock ratio (Dax) deep into the minus.
Despite a rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, the value of the property funder in Munich fell to a quarter, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and recorded 5839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, Dow lost 334 points, i.e. 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote could take place on October 1.
The other European exchanges knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index dropped 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped 2.1 percent back to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator lost 506.43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor's shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheimer has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said that Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The soon-to-frozen fuel pipelines threaten to die of frost.
For years, scientists have been troubled by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational swing of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave fully as expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are abnormalities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which perceives the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not wrong, and he is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be caused by dark matter, which may be found all the way to Earth," Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space explorers for ten years.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to have an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, matter itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists calculate that a good one fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in captivity for their kidnappers, tourists taken away in Egypt are once again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostage takers were said to have been killed.
Five German citizens were abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
Again and again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists carried away in the Sahara are free.
This was reported in concert by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV station and Italian media.
Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24 reported that Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release: "Our fellow soldiers and other hostages have been freed.
We are currently looking at their health,” said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The cause of the shooting before the release of the hostages remains obscure: According to an Egyptian security official, the hostage takers have already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisedly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was about taking the hostages," when it suddenly happened, "the surprise."
Sudan soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper al-Masri al-Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers will release the female hostages after the ransom has been paid.
The men are held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Currently led to suicide" by stepfather violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, who lives in the village of Stithians, Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of rape.
The Trouro criminal court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 at her home in the Mutley district of Plymouth on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his residence again.
Her stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, said her friends were "emotional dead" and "resigned life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got into a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter: "I always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
But it is even more thought-provoking that if he did not do so, the case might never have been brought to justice."
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to the impact Stephanie’s parents have had on your daughter over the years.
If that didn't happen, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
Officials who lost important data have been charged
According to the BBC, the government official who left top secret documents on a train in June is accused of violating official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the mildest accusation of a violation of the law and there is no suspicion of a deliberate offence.
According to Frank Gardner, a BBC Department of Defence correspondent, the move surprised many in Whitehall.
“They thought the Department of Defense and the government would treat the case as an internal matter,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, has been charged under Section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about keeping the information.
The state prosecutor's office suggested that the charges against the official be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the man's rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
On Monday, he was informed of the decision and moved from his home to an unknown place.
Housing cooperatives pay B&amp;B’s account
Britain’s housing cooperatives can expect an account of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has spent 14 billion pounds on protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), it is "an annoyance" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion-pound loan will eventually be reimbursed after the repayment of Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been acting with caution ... now have to pay the accounts of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that all companies have to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit they have. Companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies will have to set aside 81 million pounds to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the housing companies union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions which have acted prudently during the boom of the housing market must pay the bills of much less cautious institutions."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“We need to look at this in every way over the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills,” Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full-year interest rate will have to be paid, which could be twice as high as today.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or lower interest on their deposits.
Milk prices rise by fivepence per liter
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by an additional five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and following a survey conducted by a consulting company.
Resellers decide for themselves whether to pass the price increase on to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh's former parliamentarian's request to defend himself
The Bangladeshi court has rejected a request for protection from former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina, which means he can be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on the charge of extorting 50 million taka (729,700 USD) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of many corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country's army-backed provisional government give him full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for treatment, the conditions of release do not clearly show whether he can maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request by saying that it was not necessary because she had already been temporarily released and was undergoing treatment abroad," Huq said in a statement.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself on parole so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
A leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
He was arrested last year after the military-backed interim government took over, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organized polio vaccination program due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to a UN spokesperson, this happened despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or hinder the work of thousands of staff carrying out the vaccination.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV rejected
BskyB’s appeal was rejected against the decision of the Competition Committee, which ordered it to reduce its interest in rival TV station ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition required BSkyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission concluded that BSkyB’s shareholding impedes competition and gives the company an unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office reported that BSkyB’s acquisition of ITV was a threat to ITV’s independence, encouraging the Competition Committee to open an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's oversight all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV share is a pointless and disproportionate reparation - especially given that BSkyB said it would be willing to give up its right to vote.
Further investigation of the U.S. state's attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move followed that the report on the case by the Chief Inspector of the Justice Department criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials heard during the investigation have tried to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated or cleared," said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the power to require witnesses to testify.
The series began with nine state prosecutors removed from their post by the U.S. Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the state's attorneys were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it turned out later that the dismissed state prosecutors received nothing worse than many of their other colleagues. As a result, many concluded that there was political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors were involved in criminal prosecutions of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and conducting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be discharged at any time, but cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
The then head of the justice portfolio, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks because of the discharges and finally resigned.
Many other officials of the Justice Department also resigned.
In his report, Gonzales criticised Gonzales' role in the case to a large extent. According to him, the Attorney General has "primary responsibility" for dismissals, "resigned" leadership role, and "extremely withdrawn himself" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, a former assistant to Bush Sr., are criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposza Receives Appreciation
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards Awards gala for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive her special gold medal at the London ceremony next week, said she considered it an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, they were placed on the candidate list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song written by Jim Steinman required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
He appeared as a single in 1979 and reached 15th place on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the charts for almost nine years, and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has been having health problems lately. Among other things, in 2003, he had surgery for arrhythmias after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts because of acute laryngitis.
Later, it turned out that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others merely perform practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time residents would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village and is heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it's much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
Practically you can not find a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to re-envelop Extra Place and ensure that the shops and boutiques of new buildings can be reached on a cleaner path.
One of the admirers of the street is the long-standing neighbors who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the area's past before the renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building preservation and development department of the city, to stick to it.
This month, at a meeting of the district government's land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the management of the city and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, district head of municipal body number 3.
“There are very few areas in the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” he said.
"Proposals for the renovation and management of Avalon may come into play, but we also want to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-envelop the small street and provide seats. Some of these would be used by a cafe for which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first published at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
“The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this desolate alley and turn it into a pleasant public place,” he said, adding that the city had suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for Building Conservation, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office’s task was to develop buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place does not have much historical significance.
According to some, it was named "Nobody's Land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back exit of the punk rock monument CBGB, closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most famous of the photos on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"He was full of garbage, pieces of clothing, pieces of barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took possession of East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city that must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" ("The Book of Sorrows: the bitter nostalgia of the city's extinction process"), posted on his blog a part of the story about Extra Place published in 1952 in the column "City Rumor" of the weekly "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end that is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty, iron-made warehouse doors and palette windows, and where the wind carries one-week-old newspapers in the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty 0.75 litre beer bottle lay next to a discarded, fresh newspaper pile.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could be renovated.
Fields said he thought some people underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places,” he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the views of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California Studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and senior director of education research, co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice.”
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking territories.
This includes Barack Obama’s proposals on education.
According to Obama’s campaign, “Afro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan explicitly supports, among other things, “temporary bilingual education” for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, overcomes his interest in overcoming major performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep contract elementary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students in the school are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of fourth graders performed excellently in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills and rejection of excuses.
In addition, and that's what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We have had a sweeping success in the fact that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn't know who the student was who came from Mexico 12 months earlier."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set the example of other schools with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English students, such as Sixth Street Prep, as an example to follow?
The results of the school should be clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it itself consistently advocates bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn English, Obama recently said that people should not be so worried about the "exclusive Englishness" of legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should get their kids to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down on them and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America’s rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil securities dropped seven percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, stock exchanges have been rocked by Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before being again affected by the immense uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, the concern again gripped investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on an economic rescue mission this weekend, which is the largest in history.
The news was shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis would not end for a long time.
As the latest event of the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire Wachovia Corporation’s banking business, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "it seems that the rescue operation has failed to revitalise the stock market trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decline.
“The future of the common stock, interest rates and exchange rate markets around the world has become uncertain,” a Deutsche Bank analyst wrote.
“We believe that the commodity market will not be avoided by the ‘epidemic’.
The biggest question from the point of view of the commodity exchange is the extent to which the "disease" of the United States infects the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption declined due to the slowdown in economic growth, banks’ analysts cut off their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team set its record
After spending more time in the Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, the defensive end player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the slow play of Jets and Arizona Cardinals came into full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass. This became the perfect forerunner of an afternoon in which their cooperation developed significantly further.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds in a row before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the trouble," Favre said about all the passes given to Coles.
"He's a good player.
We’ve been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, in the cornerback position, caught a bad throw and threw back 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment in the match.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved so far in a quarter.
When they asked Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets getting one - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best mid- and long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory in a comfortable flat track in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous result of 2:04:26, which he achieved last year in Berlin.
By the time he was 35 years old, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for his career in so many areas that he won the world championship or reached the world record in almost every term from 1500 metres to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing, perhaps in retrospect, that air pollution would exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, initially at 9 degrees Celsius and at the end at 13 degrees Celsius - Gebrselassie won on Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon was not run before, such as Gebrselassie, and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to the longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade, since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in 1998 with a 2:06:05 result in Berlin.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, his two legs cramped and he couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything was fine.”
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival, that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his pace runners as if he were running on a track and putting world records ahead of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint on Sunday at 1:02:04 with the help of four Kenyan speed runners.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the speed runners were tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers before the finish line, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who finished second with 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory in 2:19:19.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
He was not allowed to attend the Beijing Olympics because of his alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes. This was the third marathon distance run he took part in.
He won the competition with a smart calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and after about 30 km, he came after them.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa reached second place with a time of 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop came third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and ordeal of blacks
In the adventure park in Greater Orlando - a few miles from everything that shines, loud and huge - there is a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African-American life experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guajavas and two schools cities without prison."
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, a series of celebrations in Eatonville in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer in the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers Project of the Crisis Age, is separate from its surroundings.
Just as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that urban blacks in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of the looks of outsiders.
“We’re very careful about how they tell our story,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here his whole life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black standing, but at the same time a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty rates reach twice the national average.
Partly a literary node, partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture created as a result of American slavery, which blooms in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone here calls Hurston).
In books written in an honest, strong dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "They Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he presented his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the locations of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, like drum rolling, introduced his readers to Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school with a brown background with a white border, carefully kept courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller takes care of, although he can barely read and write."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything you might need in temporary quarters."
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Clearly, Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description did not really please everyone.
"Zora told things the way they were," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as the living eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a thundering Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and long pants in a city where people still pride themselves on their dignified clothing.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but a lot of people were foreskin.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, Langston Hughes' contemporary, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no major commemorations or large public readings in Eatonville.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston’s biography, published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fights about racial mixing tasted hatred with the community.
"At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died in it.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to force integration, saying of the decision "Brown v. Board of Education" that "it offends rather than respects my species."
Today, residents say that the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, weakening the cohesion of the Eatonvilles and undermining the self-confidence of young people.
“Black children are used to being hugged, I remember, hugging their teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter, managing director of the non-profit “Keeping Eatonville Community.”
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise - black writers, actors, and artists who have overcome prejudice, as she has done, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as the following: "How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered to Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a respected Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores, which once again brought him back to America’s role models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again at the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community started organizing a Hurston festival to show what the county would destroy with its main road.
Thousands of fans have arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the ceremony every January.
Several years later, the county withdrew its proposal for road construction.
"Because of the five lanes on the main road, the community is revived, fully connected, which means real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
An increasing number of people outside the city appeared, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started going to church here in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) was opened on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains Florida's cuckoo egg: it's not quite ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes you feel like it's a suburban side street during summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take care of the outsiders who arrive here looking for Eatonville's story and what he has to say.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things – such as Eatonville’s oldest fresco painted by a white man and depicting black people working in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville, including the confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became more and more widespread, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with his problems and everything, no better, no worse, just as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
An honest civic bond is expressed in the words of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work for the local government or the police, which he believes need help.
And it seems that the younger ones have also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the rest,” Kenon said on Sunday after the service.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, then this is a very beautiful city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about newspaper booths and huge television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who hold power over New York have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers still rattle their metal tea trucks through the sidewalks, delivering trays filled with muffins for morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips are still shuffling among the blocks, carrying 50 ironed shirts like a human mule hanging on a yoke-like loop across their shoulders.
Office workers are still in line for their morning sweet pastry at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I deliberately planned to do it at the time of the afternoon's calm in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, I had about 20 people in front of me.
Not at the bank teller's window, where money can be taken or paid, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the banker "assigned to me" - lined up with the same intention as me.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have been quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has been placed under bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank rescue buyer with savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, a bank that did most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
Over the past few weeks, ordinary New Yorkers have become experts in finance.
A woman at the local Chinese store on her phone talked about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor of my apartment block in his 50s, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I changed, I don't take risks."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, where the organization "Varians Against the Conquest of Islam" was introduced.
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed with a red line.
According to the police, far-right extremists are responsible for desecrating Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when far-right parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some graves with paint sprays, but according to investigators, they only tried to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the grave desecration that took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience check following yesterday’s parliamentary elections, during which the political balance sheet tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Future of Austria by the Freedom Party and the Alliance, a highly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the votes, expressed his hatred for food allegedly associated with Islam and the campaign against headscarves and burkas.
At the party's final assembly in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that led to the victory of the far right, the change was due to the largely young voter base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of child rape, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities who checked him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police obtained a ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence of child rape convictions against Glitter to the court.
Glitter, known as Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokeswoman said: “On Thursday, September 25, Kent police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd’s planned trip to France and Spain by March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he was obliged to do so by the law on persons registered in the register of sexual offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they didn't want to talk about his unique cases in Glitter County and his possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police Department said: “The Kent Police Department is doing everything possible to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“We think it’s easier to control someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system here so that we can manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police Department is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the conduct of persons registered as sexual offenders and living in the county to minimise possible risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have boarded a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities refused to pass the passport test, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the regional police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in uxbridge, West London, because, according to Scotland Yard's request, he was admitted to the register of sexual offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs of child rape.
According to a source from the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, was reassured and pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take photos on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal point of view." -Günther Bauer
There's no scenery, no ruffles, no dance shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close by, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments far away from the audience, when we can watch a personal movement, grasp the depth of a captured look, or we can marvel at the inactive but expressive beauty of the artist's hand, which is not about to perform on stage.
In the German series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known everyday side of masters.
Through the photos, flamenco presents its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international significance of flamenco every day," the creator believes, adding that Flamenco-people "could be anyone, since when the images were seen, the observer realizes that these images do not typically depict artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivate the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the very depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave Bauer his long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits evoke classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of subjects.
However, the use of various stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes day by day and is always fascinating."
It's not the dance, it's not the song or the music in itself, it's the artist's personality and character that fascinates the audience.
In recent days, the leading motif of the works that can be seen in the El Photomata gallery is the search for an encounter with its essence, the artistic crow, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and representation.
Known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morene, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are hallmarks of this collection of photos of almost 60 artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, about which an album of portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer's passion for portraits was encouraged to repeat the idea two years ago with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different from this, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, you meet, you meet personalities that you don't even know sometimes, or who only take a few minutes to shoot.
But in spite of these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition entitled Flamenco-people, selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, can be seen in the El Photomata Gallery, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, at calle de la Mata 20 until 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "ready recklessness"
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for 20 years and also visited Amazonia.
At the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday, the writer with a chance for the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted that his current work was "ready recklessness" and "all signs that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I hope I can get to the bottom of it at some point," he concluded with these words at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo theatre.
After the greeting of Felix Romeo, a devoted audience received it. For the public, the lesson quickly flew away, during which the Peruvian writer told with amazing memory and a great deal of humor how his writing profession developed from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing methods, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his writing profession, and on what memories his stories were based.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is a mere entertainment or a tisaflower experience", since it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of ease and to take responsibility for their vocation.
Due to the harsh weather, the farewell to Pozoblanco is shorter, and the horse bullfights are also cancelled.
The horse bullfight traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco holidays was cancelled yesterday morning after the future horse toreadors found the arena's terrain unfit for the tournament.
As a result, the committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to lag behind the bullfight.
The weather hardships thoroughly torn up the series of celebrations, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain left the second bullfight behind.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought the bulls of Castilblanco.
So it wasn't until Friday that there was a bullfight.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who brought home three ears as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around shoulder-to-shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante’s two bulls gained a number of recognitions and trophies, but this was due to the audience rather than to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who contributed little to the improvement of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable march with the second bull, most of the audience was able to get out of control.
Two tons of van carrying hashish in Alawa tried to escape roadside checks
Four-fifty minutes in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police carry out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armicón (Álava).
The authorities are stopping a van in which two of them are traveling, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not conspicuous at the same time.
The investigators chased the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., the Basque government's Home Affairs Department said.
The arrested man is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armicón, where traffic control was carried out by the staff of the Álava Traffic Inspectorate on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the scene of the inspection.
The investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away on the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police eventually captured one of them, and after screening the Iveco Daily-branded van, they seized its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashishbales filling the rear part of the vehicle were transported by the police to carry out a more thorough investigation and measure the drug.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proved that the false license plate of the vehicle does not match the data in the van's papers, so the arrested person is also prosecuted for falsification of public documents.
The Basque Regional Police continue the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the motorway and, on the other hand, determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court measures began.
Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by police this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of medicine.
According to a witness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesperson for the California Traffic Administration told People magazine.
According to the witness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which partially paralysed the traffic on the highway.
"It looked like a noise," so the patrols took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was excluded almost immediately. The spokesperson also said that based on the first impression of the officers, she was believed to have been under the influence of Locklear medicine.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. Around 19 o'clock, he was taken to the local prison, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action on the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, IU Secretary-General and United Left representative, said today that the regional federation of the Corps will make a decision on the case of former Seville Councillor for Youth and Sports, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family members.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter is indeed within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that the detection of irregularities that Silva may have committed should bear in mind "transparency": "At IU has always advocated that such cases be fully transparent."
He added that part of the training is "the strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May blood", Garci's epic work
Benito Pérez's National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in May blood, which, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the human flow and social analysis he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist. At the film premiere today, Garci told the audience of actors in the company of Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
More than two and a half hours of May blood will be presented in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will screen it as a mini-series for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdos' literature, realized his childhood dream with this shooting. He owes all this to Esperanza Aguirre, because three years ago he commissioned him from Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the story could be based on the National Episodes.
The budget of 15 million was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci to present "the confused Spaniards, who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge backwardness with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regretted that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which had more than doubled the May blood. As a result, he was forced to miss some scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, were recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So he resorted to the usual method of working with the director of the Restart, recording the scenes with the actors with whom he started the rehearsals before shooting. Casting was not, because Garci considers it "humiliating", and because, as he said, "it is part of the directing profession to go to the theatre and cinema to find out what is going on in the industry in which we work."
Several actors of May's blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larra aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar award, believes that this year’s nominees representing Spain in front of the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the May blood, the Seven French billiard tables and the blind sunflowers that were finally selected, represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, “should be presented dead,” he said.
Garci doesn't expect awards with this film.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for posterity, and then you realize that all that matters is success, and in the end, you’re happy to make one more film,” Garci says with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the Catalan father (Floren a Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women’s equality, whether it was Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that inhibited women’s freedom of movement.
He started a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, the "dance of the butterfly" to the guajira, or the "dance of the snake" to the tango.
"He danced sensually, and others think that's what my style is," he says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Door at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde forms the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the invitation, I'm very honored to have you perform in my play."
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; percussionist El Pájaro, viola player Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the real diva with his constant love."
The play also largely presents the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and reaches distant landscapes at the time, including India, the United States, or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but nowadays he is no longer known and even less appreciated for his work," Bayón says.
The performance starts tonight at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of Triennium, "The Diary of a newly married poet" will also appear.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of programmes entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two of them.
Thus, the closing chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the reissue of the above-mentioned work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the memorial house of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Poplar Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God makes perfect people sometimes.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in the film Victims of Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness Newman's death in the American cinema industry and all over America.
How hard it was to get the Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
He was known to be sick,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or overextended.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home went through a particularly dark period, overshadowed by fear of terrorism and market conditions, a desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When such difficult times come and many easily lose their virtues and very few people we can look up to remain, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of people, he really embodied the platonic idea of beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, ranging from an anti-drug foundation in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his home-made biofood brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had a hard time transcending its suicidal food culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration has traveled all over Hollywood regardless of nationality and origin.
According to the last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, not a man, but an era died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today attempts to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: they demand honesty and serious privacy far away from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in the midst of today's media jungle.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He divorced once, but then he lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for 50 years, even though he would certainly have had many opportunities for infidelity.
“Why do I eat hamburgers when I have roast meat at home?” he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"He wasn't as proud of any of his performances as he was of the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather, and a devoted philanthropist."
The difficult journey of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may become 2016.”
But, I ask, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we start from yesterday's race, I don't think so at all.
It was called the perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of many I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a lot of nonsense, and if I had to be evaluated, and I would be the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
Let’s move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the receipt of the serial number, which led to the arrival of earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid standing in line later).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first, only the serial number was handed over (first senselessness, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual queue), how surprising it was, only an S shirt (second senselessness, because I have an XL size)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save money and buy only cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it was extremely early to take over the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't give up the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant to wait for more than 40 minutes, which was accompanied by popular uprising and stand-attack attempts.
I think tomorrow we'll have about 500 sure pneumonia, and some of us, myself included, won't get our position with our actual time, because I'm assuming my chip misrecorded the launch.
If you asked me about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can keep dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that, however, can perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on the company’s territory) based on the information heard from the conversation.
This "reception" can use a camera and a form and facial recognition system to recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even remember what they wear - and to hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, he can group the people present on the basis of the conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist identifies a third person, but she knows that she does not belong to the company talking to him and is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to visit someone and assures them that he will soon come to his aid.
All this without the blue big screen.
Impressive.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, many people said that Microsoft has changed its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and have fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented Spanish, considering that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming more and more marginalized, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google took the first step to become a competitor of Windows.
Many people have correctly realized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for the hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system should be taken into account, not in absolute terms, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and there is more and more time spent browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
It's less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft’s goal is to integrate its services online and eventually make it an alternative to Google.
They really need it, so I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken earlier this month in a meeting room for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster invites them to use the company's browser. - "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google to browse the web.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It does not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, in fact, in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in the Bloody Diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, as well as one of the basic costumes of the bulked gay customer audience.
And while we're on the list of specialties, we can also recall the peace figure of the weightlifter of the travelling circus with a cocky mustache.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than the - typically tight and sleeveless - men's cotton t-shirt.
That is, about the "tank", as the Englishmen call it, but no competitor of le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is referred to as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to sport, according to legend, he was named after Marcel Cerdan boxer, singer Edith Piaf's lover.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex tailoring, special logo and small (almost recognisable) Belgian flag make it stand out among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
However, the Belgian company does not only make tank tops.
Sports shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardioganes, wool pants, marine T-shirts, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and we could even list them - are all products of the company.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
However, it is also unfortunate that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but at the same time he managed to achieve himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the world of fashion.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than a few pretty and beautiful girls giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris and at the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
He's got a great deal of warmth and mildness.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which was designed by my brother Penélope. In addition, we participate in the announcement of the second Mango Fashion Awards competition and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we took over a lot of things from there.
And then, often, I just walk around the city and watch women dress, change and choose their clothes - one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
I think so too, but after all, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
Even when I was little, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and look in my aunt's closets.
Well, that was you on the Canaan, almost worth an amusement park.
And as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for classes and rehearsals so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in the role of actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday, didn't you fall into lethargy?
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think that's when women are really worth it, they're experienced enough and they make fewer mistakes in life.
The biological clock doesn't bother me.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want to do, and it gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother, because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I definitely don't want to miss that.
As far as the future father is concerned, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you've made several movies that haven't even been presented.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I look forward to the presentation of The Last Hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your debut on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization called Women for a Better World. I chose two of her own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned off, and the money received was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
They talk so much about him, so I know him, and I can assure you that half of him is not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of his activity.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know anything impossible.
Drunk drivers will be forced to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving offences, the Ministry of Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the device.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the State Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for one year.
Since the aim of the project is to restore it to the market, the driver will also have to participate in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Transport Safety, the DG Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air in it. If it is higher than allowed, or if the driver did not blow into the device at all, the system does not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the offender.
A study conducted in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved by this rule every year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from turning into crimes,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce it, as the legal reform is being implemented in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental law amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party that calls for the installation of the system in school buses, as a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English accuracy, at 17:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force's Asturias Prince's Party transport plane landed in the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already on its way down, but it was still so high that we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were coming to town for an official visit.
- Okay, well, there won't be an airport shuttle for a long time... she's from here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press knows all about the Duke of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon created by the 27 naval soldiers who protect the dignitaries.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea blue dress, and then the Princess, with her long hair caught in the wind, in restrained clothing, but not in the usual shoes that flashed her toes, may have warned Mexico City that there was a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras, then enter the room where the official reception follows.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are waiting for a reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The best place in the world to award a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and coolest of today's fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to raise international awareness of young talents in the fashion industry.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first tender, saw her own clothes in the window of Mango under 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris, and she almost shed tears of emotion.
By the way, this is the second largest European business of the company and has recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of the many events and the thanks to Valentino for presiding the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, Mango’s presidential table of the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness because of her brother’s recent death, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking ornaments of the ELAH. She accompanied Valentin to the main table of the dinner in her honor with her son Luis, nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Along with Baron Rotchil, they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, as they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own-designed pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night opera visit, Gaya Toledo was so excited in the ballet room that, recalling the old days, she snuck up to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before that, he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we could enjoy Oliver Martinez - he's almost two meters tall and he's on a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said in advance that he didn't want any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l a l a, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000, and there's one way to turn off the chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at bookstores on September 30th to bring peace of mind.
It's almost agonizing at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how fast-tracked life today's world forces you to live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and overcome problems at work.
No, that number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find a solution that is most pleasing and adaptable to their free minutes.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 relaxation method and the calm from it comes to the bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
In addition, it offers other ideas that all help relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and your stress life has become a central problem, it’s time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus on reading alone.
Those who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more of you have been told that you spoke last night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a high fever illness), or more regular (once a day, weekly or monthly), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often combined with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, nighttime alarms, nighttime bedwetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, a state with a high fever, or even a stressful situation or an increased excitement can be an accompanying phenomenon.
In any case, it has been studied little so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, it can consist of incoherent words, murmuring, but unlike all this, it can also occur in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and turn to a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety and thus offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by another manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, here are a number of preventive measures:
Make sure your child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose comforting games and avoid making your child watch fear-inducing or more aggressive TV shows or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to relax are taught some relaxation methods to find inner peace of mind more easily.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If you do start talking while you're asleep, try to keep our calm.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary because the child is unconscious, but he would get out of sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Remember, if you experience severe anxiety more than once, it is advisable to contact a specialist or explore what causes a child to experience a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), do not start asking questions to find out anything about him.
It would be unnecessary, since he is not so conscious as to collect his thoughts during sleep.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that they can question his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, since it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
Finally, the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took a new boost and won another victory at home.
Although there was no awesome match, the yellow-blacks were in a position several times, one of which they could finally win.
The pace of the match was not very tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot at the gate was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. Then the Illhaeusern came to the top, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a distant shot, and then Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain spickel and Diebold also tried to shake the protection of Dannemarie with a distant attempt.
On the other side, the players defended themselves in a block on the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: first Riahi and Temporale were placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: after Diebold's first shot, Marais of Illhaeusern scored the ball with an excellent position and then put it into the gate (53 minutes).
However, the goaler of Illhausern could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of its advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds saved some excitement when, after a great rush, the ball came very close to the goalpost.
Sarkozy Meets Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by fishermen crippled the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistere on Tuesday morning to meet representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with specific proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee", which was set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in gas oil prices, as the oil price exceeded the average price of 1.14 euros per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said the president would “negotiate with fishermen what solutions could help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for sailors.”
The fishermen are looking forward to Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, in Morbihan and Calvados County, traffic slowing demonstrations were held that caused congestion nearly 10 km long.
They also paralysed the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-ele were not blocked.
Roadblocks were placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination, and at dawn, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel warehouses in the Brest ports, while demonstrations took place in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. In Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, for example, fishermen did not board ships, while in Le Havre some 20 ships hindered the traffic of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the county of Loire-Atlantique eliminated the huge Total oil refinery blockade in Donges in the evening.
Boulogne-sur-Mer's fishermen, on the other hand, decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting in the Ministry with a decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to decide on Tuesday on its next step and participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
“The strike continues,” said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently pay about 50 cents for their litres, but they believe that the only way to make a ship profitable would be to reduce the price of diesel to less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Beautiful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was killed at the age of 83 in Connecticut as a result of cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to Paul Newman, an actor committed to the film legend and profession who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its delivery plans for 2008
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is able to keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is very important for the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, set up by U.S. financial authorities, wants to sell more than 15% of its assets so that it can repay $85 billion in advance, the Dominican edition of the Financial Times said.
In addition to its life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities at international level, AIG would cut off most of its other business, the newspaper said.
According to the Times, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
The AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company’s aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG must quickly acquire liquid assets to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government, thus taking the risk of losing 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders accordingly.
Paris Historique Study on Morning Meeting's Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which represents an unprecedented decline of nearly 800 points), and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) sank by 777.68 points, so it closed at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest decline in the index to date (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed following the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Based mainly on technology papers, Nasdaq closed at 1 983,73 points with a 199,61 point drop, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500's expanded index decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock exchange was already indisposed at the time of the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it went deep.
By 228 "no" votes to 205 "yes" they refused to provide the funds requested by Minister of Finance Henry Paulson.
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans voted against the plan.
“This market has picked up bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be "too late".
“If the plan is really doomed ... then it will be up to the Fed and the other central banks to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to tighten,” warns Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To further enhance his sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "Every day, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt in the United States."
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market "has developed not only an American, but a global crisis," adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen significantly.
The yield of the 10-year government bond fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, and the 30-year-old fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first television duel
The first debate of the two US presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be out of the duel as winners.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaigners claimed the victory in the television duel watched by one third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was respectable, it was not "impressive enough" to stop his popularity from falling, as evidenced by surveys five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better at fighting: according to the results of the poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most calculating, still indecisive voters, 39% of those surveyed believe Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden's promising Thursday appearance, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned this weekend: “It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
He's got a good feeling."
McCain, in his seventies, never fails to put his own indisputably vast foreign policy experience first. In addition, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand,” the attack said several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack platform that has been exploited by the Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, focused on the fact that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he said it together and accurately.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does," the Democratic ad posted this weekend said, pointing out to the Republican leader that he still didn't assess the impact of the crisis on the American "people of the street".
“In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered in the rain in North Carolina.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The turbulent situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, who the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said Charles Schumer, a Democratic senator.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had “excellent instincts in the field of the economy” like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment on the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator confirmed once again that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, he will be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goals include the creation of a possible energy independence of the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to establish 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the issues related to the $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opposition protesters protested in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closing of the polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square to protest against falsifying the election results.
Although results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the following words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!"
Some admit that they didn't even go to vote: "Why would I go? They're doing what they want with my vote anyway!" says a young man.
Protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to present itself well to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic change of regime.
If the elections were to be considered clear by observers, they could lift the sanctions on the country, which denied 40 Belarusian leaders visas and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
“We were kept away from the election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” said Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson for the United Democratic Forces coalition, which was organized from the twelve parties.
"The changes were purely nominal," emphasized Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case it is the executive power.
If the opposition delegates get into Parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to have a seat on television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit bills.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because "a dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk falling under Russia's control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high, and the wide-ranging organisation of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of voters participated in Minsk) has given rise to any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was released as the last person in prison in August this year, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
There will be a maximum of five opposition representatives in Parliament, namely those who are most suited to the leadership.
By October Square, the silence of the night falls again.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Committee rejoice.
Blood is safe again.
The Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of people, which was severely shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserve treated by the Canadian Red Cross blood service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and general upheaval, the government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994 under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever. The purpose of this was to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to formulate proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed the submission of his report, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one is the Hema-Québec serving Quebec, the other is all the other provinces and the Canadian Blood Supply Society responsible for the care of the two territories.
"When Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we managed to regain the trust of people." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population considered Hema-Québece reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since the foundation of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, the principle of caution has been applied.
During this period, a number of cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its foundation in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain changes, inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
And a few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease spread through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, there was a technique on the market that allows the HIV virus to be diagnosed more sensitively. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, not antibodies against the virus on which the tests used earlier were built.
Using the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk of unknowingly infecting blood cells by blood donors and that this could not be detected.
With these improvements, the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions has been greatly reduced.
Today, the risk of receiving HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
“In other words, this means we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health today, according to Hema-Québec’s No. 1 leader.
“The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens will be introduced into the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we have to be on guard all the time," Dr. Décary continued, and then stressed that, apart from emergency reserves, Hema-Québec had to provide enough permanent reserves.
“As the population grows older, so do the needs.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood donors, since the number of people in the network who can donate blood accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years old, who meets the conditions of fitness, can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria destroys are not entitled to donate blood for a year.
“With these 3 percent we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones age, because they can no longer donate blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In this fast-paced world today, a man hardly has an hour to go to give blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen and placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages Quebec's only public stem cell bank.
Blood can be extracted from the umbilical cord once treated only as medical waste, which is rich in stem cells, thus allowing the treatment of serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the inclusion of the 1,000th cord blood sample in our bank, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who says that the umbilical cord blood removal program is very popular today.
“Many mothers are sad that they don’t have the opportunity to do so,” he said, “because Hema-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football - Semi-finals with Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday at the USL-1 qualifier and reached the semifinal with the overall 4:3 result. This was the second quarter-final and decisive match for the total results, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second half the two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, found themselves in the opponent's net.
Only Roger Levesque of the Sounders team managed to play goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Recall that in his first match on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact plays in the semifinal with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which lost 3:1 from Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but Whitecaps reached the semifinal with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
Canadiens' favorite triassic is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally the Canadians won 3:2 punitive shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored one goal. Plekanec finished the match with two goals, and Kovalev finished with one goal pass, which was the fourth victory from the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
"I need another game to really feel in shape."
“He was trying to get too much out of himself in the first third,” said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the match.
He's got a huge ovation."
Charest 's
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Just as the meeting of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest traveled yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) is seeking victory in the interim election to be held today.
"Repressing our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was set by Jean Charest at a meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president tried to focus on the essence.
During his performance, behind his back, he was screened with images similar to "Moulin . . images".
The three giant projectors were followed by stunning images: hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very close.
The "north plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" of Quebec's future, embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at 49 degrees latitude) has often been included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
However, the head of state merely explained why he considered the North to be “a treasure mine full of huge opportunities”, but he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few opportunities for development: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of catching-up countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north there is "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is "our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only in us, but in us,” he said, stressing that he wanted to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec’s development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a theatrical break and looking at the huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
“There is a boundary on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government,” he said.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we also need to rethink our view of the North,” the Prime Minister said, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which opens every year as a result of the melting of polar ice.
According to the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will bring a lot of benefits, especially to young people.
The two ministers belonging to the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was a delegate of Parti Québécois inungava) have already begun negotiations with about 30 local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee led by Benost Pelletier has also started its operation, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not necessarily a summit", where "a common vision is created".
The North would otherwise be developed in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly,” the Prime Minister said.
Jean Charest described this vision as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This, by the way, was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québecet, Lesage, who carried out the quiet revolution and the national spread of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” Charest said.
At the press conference, he quoted another - true conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister's program "Roads to the North" between 1957 and 1963.
In connection with the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, President Charest highlighted that the installation is planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was received by a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which is also allowed by the law.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he took on tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the summit of Quebec-New York.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thinking. This is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party in particular demands the recognition of "Québec's specific character" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members have the right to veto decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
Parti Québécois leader Paulina Marois re-launched the development policy in northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, refused to apply this policy.
Had they not done so, "we would have been much ahead of you today," said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Francoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"But we want it not to be a mere act," noted Sébastien Proulx, party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, Secretary of the Harper Cabinet (by the way, Minister of Justice) last summer took the liberty of calling Louise Arbour Canada "shame."
Thus, to desecrate a woman who has fought for justice incessantly and deserves all our admiration - this tells us a lot about the people surrounding the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, who, among the Western countries concerned alone, did not bring home his own citizen from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes charged to him.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer in inhumane conditions.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet theater while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Association of Lawyers are also demanding Omar Khadr's repatriation so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, at present there is an insidious destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper constantly utters this word, which from his mouth sounds like an empty voice.
So the time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the mercy of the leader of a government that has been a minority until now (and what can come after October 14th...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that glorifies Virtue, Law and Order. They do not see that this government tramples on the values to which our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is rather this - don't look elsewhere.
Review of Barrick Gold Orwelli
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President and CEO of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
As a result of Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a six million dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company for the initiative of, so to speak, a "public debate".
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation cases, is based not on the truth, but on the law.
It is not surprising that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way of public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada have to spend considerable money on defense and fighting in an unequal fight where on the other hand there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources of the mining industry.
By the way, in such an unequal struggle, the tactic is often to destroy the defendant and conclude a friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposite, but even intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in front of the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this happens differently, in Canada, the arguing parties usually do not hit each other with sticks, but tell each other their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine would have had enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying for independent research groups that could have revealed the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public and, in one move, sweeps aside petitions and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, he disregarded the opinion of this public?
In the vice-president's mind, this word probably means only the lawyers who are paid well, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed down a lot.
In a democratic state, even those who detest others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because they condemn the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and form a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, not by a lawsuit aimed at silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal discussions, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
On the whole, the procedure denies the right to quote credible sources, something to debate the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis of intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of today, under the burden of litigation, who will take the liberty of doing so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
In our university circle, we have been able to handle disputes, differences of opinion and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's reckless procedure shows that, contrary to his claim, he has no interest in having an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and for the Canadian public debate institution. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation, which has been the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective control of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the envisaged public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to lack of payments; right of access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican congressman Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, Bush administration representative.
“We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do that, there will be a huge amount of shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Congressman Judd Gregg.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
They gave themselves a deadline for the deal to open the stock market this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but they did not welcome the fact that the situation had increased to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the expansion of the agreement with elements such as the provisions on the preservation of house ownership or the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the state.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people’s irresponsibility, that’s not very welcome.
These steps, however, are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope I do."
What I have read in broad terms is that it is something that we all have to digest and that we can move on with.
“The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the dubious demands of American financial institutions, something at risk, unsold assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the burst of real estate balloons, which first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the uproar of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft deal was broken by a group of Republicans last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats have agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty will be provided by the government rather than bought up.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, the plan included a provision requiring that if the government had to bear the losses under the programme for five years, it could levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion instalment would first be paid, followed by an additional $100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by a new vote.
In exchange for help, Washington acquires a share in the subsidised companies, through which it receives dividends from profits and can sell them after the crisis has ended.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan. In addition, it can set the maximum amount of wages and severance payments that can be paid to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on today by the House of Representatives and Wednesday by the Senate.
However, despite their efforts, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, there were repeated statements against the plan among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It's very clear that Washington can't hear your voice," Scott Garrett, a member of the House's finance committee, told his constituents.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that benefits taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic representative who led the small congressional group called the "sceptic faction", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred outstanding economic experts, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us asking Congress not to hurry and carefully examine which path to take,” Sherman said in a statement.
At the same moment in Europe, it was again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalize part of the Fortis banking group worth EUR 11.2 billion (US$ 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitor on the verge of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (US$2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
“This is not wasted money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
“We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Manche, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of Bradford and Bringley Bank's ongoing loans, of which real estate loans amount to EUR 41 billion (US$ 75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would acquire the British bank's subsidiaries and clientele.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has wanted to nationalize since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Actor's Idol
Beautiful azure eyes, some say his main card, others say his main weakness.
Did the American actor with a charming smile ever get rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
Through his shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent, he was also far from the harsh style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a huge career he's entered!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at his estate in Connecticut, one of the last icons of the American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled, and who for a long time was a rival on the screen. He was more restrained and undoubtedly vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University, then at Actor's Studio in New York before it exploded into the world of theatre, television and shortly thereafter cinema.
In addition to being at the forefront of civil rights, he won second place as a racing driver in 1979 in the 24-hour race in Le Mans. In addition, he was considered a sex symbol, although he has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what the shadows of this mysterious, private, dedicated actor's life were, who hated the glamour of show business.
He was an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his great roles we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his oeuvre, the seventh American art has flashed before us, cinema has been with constant changes for more than 50 years.
In our memory, we remember the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the estranged young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role we saw in Tennessee Williams processing "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990), we can remember him in the form of sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age with his marriage failing to fulfill his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up There", he performed an unforgettable performance in the role of Rocky Graziano, a stormy criminal-boxer. This role, originally intended for James Dean, and taken over after his death, started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work "The Great Trouble", which won the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961), he played a bitter, vengeful billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money".
Times are changing, but it's always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by a change in eras.
The younger ones are mainly known from George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a hockey team working with unusual methods.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Jump" in 1994.
The line was closed by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of damnation" in 2003: it was the last time he appeared in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not consider it "a living refutation of underplay" without any humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen into the lap of film roles.
Yet he played young and successful characters less often: rather, he formed figures on the edge of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to return with perfect credibility.
As director, Newman showed a less well-known face: his truly chaste and sensitive man at the bottom of his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adapted by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence's novel), she starred with her wife Joanne Woodward in a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
The 1984 film "Harry and his son" commemorates Scott, his son who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman's countless admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said with sorrow: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and his criticism of Hollywood's debauchery are obscured.
Many times we could see his picture smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in his mouth, although at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In a letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all else.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including falsification of documents, which cause particularly significant damage to the criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money won was used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed by false invoices.
State and municipal money - about HUF 65 million in total - migrated partly to the young left's cash register and partly to the pockets of some people.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the money won was taken on the basis of cost invoices behind which there was no real performance, and the associations never complied with the commitment undertaken.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, the invoice blocks were acquired on the market in Józsefváros, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to which companies should the production of invoices take place, it was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidéki körút to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, on the model of which the invoices to be submitted to the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest were prepared.
Most of these were written by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, mostly wrote the reports necessary to obtain the grants.
One of Lados' "study trips" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for the 90-person group of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, according to the manager, they would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued to the Foundation for a Better Future - later Together for the Third Millennium - in the summer of 2002 was filled with formal and content errors.
A bed and breakfast in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form fillers were also exaggerated when they marked Pigal Kft., which is also a catering company, in whose accounts, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not even include documents about the Better Future and the name of Oops.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and bills were shown to him, he immediately knew that these were false documents.
“The name of our company and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp.”
He added that in addition to the formal reasons, it was not right that a hundred people were accommodated according to the bill, because they have a total of eleven rooms in which there are not so many seats.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant hasn't worked in a long time.
The zealous account makers did not investigate the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at only organizes foreign trips, so they marked travel in Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's account issuance practice.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Better Future, as the company's service is not charged by the designated 25 percent, but by 15 percent VAT, and the employees of the hotel only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" also corrupted the invoice by the fact that in the case of a company road freight transport was designated as an activity carried out, it was revealed through the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company originally based on investment advice.
In addition, it was also due to formal deviations - inadequate account format, not a real stamp - that the accounts for the Foundation for the Third Millennium, the Cultural Association of the 21st century and the Commissioner Point were false.
Just like Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehérto, whose representatives denied that the accounts were issued by them.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was under liquidation at the time (2001) when the Young City Association group ate there, which is why, as far as we know, the company's liquidation commissioner denied that he would have issued the paper.
Consciously Exposed
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Foundation for Chance Budapest issued an invoice for the Foundation for the Third Millennium for some HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious invoice.
The Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Pine Association with invoices of roughly HUF 5 million, behind which there was no real economic activity.
There is no money movement either, because the completed invoices were then reduced, but the organisations have already forgotten to include it in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to those that can be linked to the accused.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest, which deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade, although not located there.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the Ltd., he issued an invoice to Atlas, Oops and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, and he took up their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies worked, which the defendant said was because they didn't get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were useful because, at the request of his accused partner Zsolt Szente, a lawyer who also prepared the documents of the company's foundings, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices to the organisations worth HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutors said that 10% of the bills and VAT hit Kubatov's grip.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the tender of the Commissioner Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the socialist party's public benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to avoid this finding, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found, by the way, during a search of the house in Árpád Kemecsei's office at the education wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the prosecutor's office, are likely to report on the process of bill production.
The most interesting thing can be if the primary defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to raise the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak in full, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the interest of this, or whether the socialists have made a deal with him in exchange for the compensation of most of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi will take the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to place him under house arrest, have constantly fallen on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and do not convert them are free to walk or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of over-licensing: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
This well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been able to reveal the neurological-economic foundations of neuroscientists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be left behind in a type of competition such as eBay’s auction, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the nervous system pattern of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group took part in a player auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method was used to examine the active brain areas of the experimental persons.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, in which the overlicensing of the other party is an essential element, the subcortical complex striatum was activated intensively when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system, among other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in the price can be explained by avoiding the violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the members of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told how much the real value of the product was, and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they were won out of the game, they would be rewarded with $15 more.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group also lost this money.
So the difference between the two groups was that one of them was stressed to win and the other to lose.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the "against loss" team were willing to bet higher than the control and "winner" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the phenomena of auctioning with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now having a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death in Hungary.
The number of people with hepatitis at home is 100,000, but only 7,000 are treated, the reason for which is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, typical of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (doves, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travelers should be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, usually accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After this, the jaundice on the skin and whites of the eyes develops, the stool becomes bright, the urine becomes dark, the healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people a year worldwide die from the more severe form of the disease, hepatitis B-induced liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the cells of the liver, in many cases only after 20-30 years the first symptoms appear.
Thus, it is very important to carry out early prevention, regular screening tests.
In three groups, there is much more than average: between people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooists.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is currently 200 million in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth contacting the general practitioner when any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
Recognizing the disease in time, the virus can be eliminated from the body, thus eliminating infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by patient organisations around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects people's sense of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
In the framework of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were given electroshock, while they all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that scans the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university in addition to academics.
The study was conducted precisely by attaching a sparking device to the test subject's left hand, which provided the electroshock.
Researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century with Lady Hermeline.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as being "cared for" and "rested, filled with peace".
While looking at the religious image, they reported 12% less pain than when they saw Leonardo’s creation in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, only the right photo should be found.
“We should find a picture of someone they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality,” Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a similar-caliber painter showed a picture of a madonna to the believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would the sight of the Virgin Mary of quality bring even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say that people’s pockets are as much as they are in the sky above their heads; he knows where they’ve vacationed, what specialist orders they go to, and what they’re interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's main people.
As for the skeptics who parallel the Orwell horror, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary to keep up with the original goal of Google founders, which sounded like “get all the information in the world into a system.”
According to Google, the company is still at the beginning of ten years of world-wide subversive work to manage all the information.
Asked what would happen five years later, Schmidt replied: “You want Google to be able to answer questions like ‘What do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘What kind of work would I really do?’ – but until then, software can’t answer such simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the fact that search queries are accurately recorded, the IP address from which they were searched and the page to which they left after the search.
Launched two years ago, Personalized Search will allow users to store their own surfing background stories, look back at what they were looking for, and generate much more personalized results for them in the long run - the same logic will be based on Recommendations, which will offer us products and services based on our previously described and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at me, what do I do? - asks users who are worried about seeing Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the rebellion against power triggers counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but may also be transferred to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected by anything.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on pedophiles from the social network Orkut, which it maintained, to enable identification.
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights may have sighed in May when the company, together with the EFF electronic rights organization, successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI: according to these, Google could not be forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI at any time in the future by any point in the Constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought some 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search terms, which it obtained by referring to the ratification of the Child Protection Act adopted years earlier, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and a two-month full list of websites and keywords.)
Google’s perception is quite controversial: those who fear giving their personal data are scourged because they feel that their privacy and privacy are being compromised by the fact that they are starting to use Google’s services and are taking action against them with the rebellion of multi-company companies in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users in many countries see them as the next generation of big companies, the "hot corporation", unlike its rival, Microsoft, who is considered a world conqueror because of Windows, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google does not ask its users for identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, continuously kept source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, more cool than the official software giant's practice.
However, it may also happen that geeks have an accurate understanding of the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been drawn by one of the most frequently expressed keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is all about collaboration, deliberately leaving clues and exploiting the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these varies from person to person, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can run a profile from Facebook to Xanga on several social networks, connect them to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm listing his music habits, and then connect them to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and lead a blog that automatically displays their latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases from which we can see: the girlfriend easily discovers the morning photo flood of the common circle of friends, who her fraudulent friend spent the evening with or can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on top management in her blog: a sure, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
If you live an online life, it consists of what you show yourself, this is how we can formulate the basic principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
And if you want to hide something, or at least avoid the Google monopoly, you can do it (for example, with Scroogle using Google's search system, but not deliberately leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who deliberately do not sign up for social networking sites so that they cannot be found, Google's online applications can be switched from word processor to image manager and news reader with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and that do not compile the best profile we have ever had.
The public is not so secretive when Google shows the protein of its teeth.
The company is worth $156 billion more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten advertising agencies' revenues, and services at an ever-accelerating pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
However, critics also find the counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of employees after doubling the company kindergarten fee, the management found it too expensive to feed employees every day, but it is dwarfed by the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, according to their agreement, the company filters out any hits that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they do not announce a new service in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is so large that the company will soon have to face the U.S. Supreme Court, others fear Health's system, in which we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also give a good raw material to the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, Scroogle dot Orwelli, describes the future in which a man can only be approached alarmingly well from Google data.
Two juveniles helped the Ózd double killer with the crime scene.
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the Ózd double murder, and they were well suspected of helping to cover up the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the act they are burdened with, and they are currently accused of abetting.
The two juveniles - according to MTI's information, two girls - are at liberty.
Abetting can be punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the Ozd double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was arrested in advance on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated, profit-seeking, murder of several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to an Ózd site last Wednesday, where he killed him and then the man's nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime in advance, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a hidden gun at the scene.
The gun and the conditions of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange bids to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which the Poles made despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers in a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the offer of the Poles is the highest amount offered so far for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a share of about 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday, dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers have already referred to "September 11th".
The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States, accused by Rome's La Repubblica, the President has not even been able to line up his own party behind a draft bill that is designed to remedy the desperate situation.
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press see the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but the vote in Congress threatens to put Washington out of the political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can still provide a lifeline to support financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino cubes, neither funds nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, infirmary financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion, according to the Vienna Der Standard, the concerns that, like the Americans, European taxpayers need to reach deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
Rescuers don’t have to start waving hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good to fix it: in which case it is reasonable to touch taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
The flying of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision, if not to mimic obstacle sensors in the natural world?
The bees, for example.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, bumblebee bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point for building the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C bio-imitation robot control system, a robotized mini-car with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety cover, explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of technology PR and research and development brand at the exhibition.
The role of the complex eye of the uterus is important, which can see in all directions at an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of a complex eye, engineers touched on the idea of a laser telemeter.
This identifies obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C within a 2 metre range, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If that were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
You need to react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, a layer within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only towards the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless opportunity for bees to avoid other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration and slowing down were used here as an option available to the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store it.
This device only has to process and react to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you constantly use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate bypass technology, which Nissan estimates will be able to enter production cars within ten years.
Another possibility of application is the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to the specified end goal by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He also became the name of the expensive child.
A written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law to be applied in several instalments to buy bad loans from banks has been completed.
In the first round, half the amount is spent.
According to Eastern Coast time, during further discussions after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders have come to terms with the debate around the $700 billion rescue package that has been going on for days, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said the deal is now on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson, speaking of the outcome of the compromise, stated that the programme will work and be effective, but further work is needed. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wheel of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening 8 (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause a spectacular rise in the fairs.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft law on the programme, which will be called the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, and then the Senate will vote on the law.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night and welcomed the news of the agreement at the White House.
“We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, by the way, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which would have meant that $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of low-quality, credit-backed securities.
In the first round, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, of which the Treasury Department will buy credit-backed, low-rated securities, and another $100 billion will depend on the President's decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body involving the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new resolution by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made in the framework of auctions and directly, Ministry officials said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program, where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to get $700 billion to the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the widespread purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the bosses of banks in distress and waiting for state help can expect their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a gold parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute unless the levitated bank manager is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the management money is not exaggerated.
The image includes the fact that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, commented the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the state acquires the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank saved with it recovers.
The bill states that in the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about the plan.
“This is not what American citizens asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayers’ dollars,” Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, California, said in a statement.
Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were urged by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, the domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, KSH reports.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than in the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than in the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum of 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The biggest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8%), mainly due to a 4.6% monthly price increase in bag and belt production and a 2.5 percent monthly price increase in footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product production sector (1.6%).
Price reductions occurred in the sectors of oil processing (1.4%), electric machinery, instrument production (0.9%) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases ranged from 0.2% to 0.9%.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represented a significant weight in the domestic sales of industry, increased by 0,3 %, mainly due to the prolonged effect of the official gas price increase carried out from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, prices increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%) in terms of domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors.
There was an increase of 13.2 percent in the production of metal processing products sector and 11 percent in the production of food, drink and tobacco.
Price reductions occurred in the textile, textile products (2.5 percent) and electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 percent) sectors.
Price increases in other manufacturing sectors ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1%.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7 percent a year earlier.
In August, the largest monthly price increase in domestic sales was seen in the capital goods manufacturing sectors (0.7%).
Consumer goods sectors grew by 0.3 percent, and energy and re-use sectors remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the highest price increase was observed in energy and re-use sectors (16.8%).
We measured a price increase of 6.8% in the consumer goods sectors and a price decrease of 1.4 percent in the capital goods sectors.
In August, the export sales prices of the industry increased by 1.1 percent compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to 12 months.
In a month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro and 7.1% compared to the dollar, and by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and 15.9% compared to the dollar compared to August 2007.
Do you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "now virtually everything depends only on the timely establishment of an electronic access and control system overseas".
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The leader of Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiating in Washington from today.
He meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will award the Star and hold discussions with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Next to the bank rescue package are Barack Obama and McCain.
Both Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, supported the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of marathon negotiations, Congress and administration representatives announced at dawn on Sunday that they had concluded an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defrost the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be more capable than their rivals of leading the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melted McCain's advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's nomination as Vice President.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the $700 billion package law would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages that he supported.
“We have to act now, with responsibility... your jobs, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy are at risk,” he said before the crowd of 35,000.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas obsolete.
McCain said in an interview with ABC that "we're all going to have a hard time swallowing this... but doing nothing is simply not a viable way to do it."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a board to oversee the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the severance pay of top leaders, which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a meaningful role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
Review of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the voters become more self-conscious, so Der Spiegel analyses the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, Bavaria's revolution eats up its birth fathers, he analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising to the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party ceased.
In 1998, CSU landed at 47.7% for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was mentioned in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the modernisation carried out consistently by the CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the voters to CSU in the developing regions of Bavaria, secularization, educational results, the introduction of East and North Germans.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have voters become more self-conscious, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks classical civic groups have been most distant from the CSU; they are liberal professions, industrialists, graduates and higher education graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In the article "Who, Who? Party Presidents on the Lowly Coalition Issues", the conservative Vienna daily deals with the confusing domestic political situation following the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss the coalition.
The election took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, party leaders barely allowed insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - it exists in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the ÖVP, as Vice Chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open to the party for the time being, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ was once again open in all directions.
“To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Equal Opportunities Summit was launched in Paris, hosted this year by France, which represents the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, drew attention to educational segregation in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional meeting, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, this is the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European human rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
According to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are primarily excluded from the labour market due to their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and only a small part of them can obtain higher education as a result of poor basic education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children could mean strengthening the economies of the European Union Member States.
According to the Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the most widespread way, including between Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid on income and consumption.
“The Roma must be granted the right to quality education under the right of EU citizenship and the elimination of their low-quality and separate education must be guaranteed,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to bring together the European Union’s objective and action-oriented to speed up the desegregation processes in schools immediately, for which the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential.
“The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen,” Járóka said.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
The fate of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October.
Despite the ugly election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Party President Erwin Huber and Provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in place, the question is how long grace will last.
The fate of the 17% disastrous voter tandem will be decided by an extraordinary party convention on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized pair showed that they did not stick to their chairs with all their strength.
By doing so, they tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who demanded personal consequences the day after the "Bajor tsunami" because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they only ran 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “single ruler” in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of German GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count high in the southern province of the key for the Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of reorganization within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the possible successor of Huber, will also be included in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start soft-talking negotiations on a possible government coalition in Munich with the liberal FDP and the Free Electors organized along the right-wing values.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a coup opportunity, and then harshly dealt with the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, who has so far woven the threads from the background, will play an active role in the transition, calling 28 September the most bitter day of his political career by the former Provincial Prime Minister and former CSU President.
Huber made some epic comments to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the brothers.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in the national success of 2005, is somehow not restored together.
According to Merkel, which is difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the CSU's loss of soil will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Grand Coalition.
What is relative, of course, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result in Bavaria by 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it can be explained by the illegality committed at the time of the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislation of the country of 10 million has been without the opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that, as a result of the constitutional amendment, Lukashenko, who renewed his term of office for the fourth time in the disputed elections in 2006, would "allow" some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament.
Thus, the ODSZ also stopped the boycott that had been considered in advance.
The opposition expectations were based on the fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has taken out loans to reduce the ever-expanding Russian gas imports and has also contributed to the Russian transfer of Beltransgaz to the gas pipelines passing through the country, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive travel permits because of the anti-democratic political system in Belarus.
He pointed out in advance that the OSCE focused on positive shifts in the evaluation of the election campaign rather than on shortcomings, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from running.
However, the OSCE rapid report on Monday already objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates could not substantially appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is still a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, has already considered the two areas independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Mr Milinevich said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to allow even an opposition to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course, and we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are putting obstacles to the dissemination, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting the change, including among the elderly," said Milinevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which sees the creation of social security as its main result, is not considered appropriate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
“Due to the country’s indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before the breakdown of social security, evoking the silence of the cemetery,” Milinkevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers classified the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, who led the mission of the Community of Independent States, told Russian news agency Ria Novostyi: "People believe not words but actions", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotating doors were installed for the entry and exit of workers.
As of today, this new measure will take effect against skilfuls, to filter out those who block and then go out to have coffee at work.
Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office, presented the anti-stealing novelty today.
“Rolling gates,” Brunetta said, “are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services.”
“There will be a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform," Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
According to Masi, "the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view".
“We did not see any resistance from the employees,” the secretary-general said, “the workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated.”
In a word, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta smiles and advises: "A good little cappuccino at 7 a.m. can do wonders"
The Roman College of Public Administration
At the meeting, the Minister said: “In three months, the absences of public sector workers due to illness have decreased by 50 percent, which means 60,000 more people in one year.”
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more effective.
“The wage dynamics of which, according to the Minister, have been twice as high as those of the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and well above the inflation rate.”
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered, joining the petition supported by the Italian Organisation of Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the Brunetta regulation.
"While the Minister of Public Administration is boasting of data to support the reduction of absences due to illness, the war of 'untired slackers' is constantly growing," the consumer association writes.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative employees have gathered to declare war on the illegal requirements of the regulation."
The regional administrative court is challenged, inter alia, to abolish the additional sickness benefit due to reasons of service, to extend the period of residence of workers on sick leave at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects contained in the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, of which 3 end in death and 27 end in permanent disability.
According to the occupational accident insurance company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and requires almost twice as many victims as manslaughter.
Today, Anmil organizes for the 58th time in every county in Italy, the Day of Victims of Work Accidents traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, support the fact that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Accidents at Work.
The head of state sincerely praised the association's "persistent commitment to prevention at work, to protecting the interests of workers who have suffered an accident, to helping family members of victims and to making public opinion sensitive".
"Nature and honest-to-everyone outraged by such tragedies, which, by their size, attract media and public attention, but in reality, we face dramatic, repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with a lack of resources, the financing of education and information is crucial.
Intra-school initiatives aimed at direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain an interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be low on the social importance of the issue, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
The president of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that "the serious accidents at work that result in death have a social significance that affects the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work shows a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high," Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli said in a statement.
"We do not want this downward trend to be accompanied by a downward trend, because the greatest tragedies occur when attention is reduced."
"We believe that at a general level we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex programme of action.
In our opinion, we need stricter supervision and control, Mercandelli stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education."
“More efforts are needed to inform and capture the public,” he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticized "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and "the trend towards which the system has drifted in recent years".
“The aim is therefore to restore to the workers the safety afforded by insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the arbitrary and divisive measures of the legislators.”
MP3 players can cause hearing loss
Permanent hearing loss can be caused by longer and high volume listening of portable player devices such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, referring to an opinion published today by the EU Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The report shows that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music players for more than one hour a day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss," the statement said.
“It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones in bulk and frequently are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk, and we urgently need to respond,” he added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this.
In the light of this expertise, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can operate with sufficient efficiency and keep up with the latest technologies."
Brussels has asked the independent scientific committee to investigate the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise pollution they cause.
"Researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine possible measures to protect children and young people from noise pollution caused by portable players and similar devices," said a member of the Committee.
The current European safety regulation defines maximum noise levels that can be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but there is increasing concern about hearing loss due to overuse of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise damage, which can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for those users of portable player devices who listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum level for noise at work.
If you listen to music in similar conditions for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of users of portable devices, which can mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee for the future of the capital city
It starts today, it lasts until March, and the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the "Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will develop Rome's guidelines.
Following the final word in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee so that in June the strategic plan of the capital city, officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno, can be submitted.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented," Alemanno said, "and it is the task of the committee to come up with proposals for the development of Rome, on which political decision-makers, including the General Assembly and the Local Government Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the good of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be disbanded because it has a mandate for a fixed period of time.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the "Future of the Capital of Rome", the mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, claiming that the expert opinion it has set up is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on the work the Commission will do and the quality of the proposals it puts on the table.
If the standard proves to be adequate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I take for granted in the case of Rome, his contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the management of daily affairs and in the management of urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further and plan for the longer term, taking into account the perspective of the future, and we are committed to working for the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless "head of water" because it is completely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro, but it will serve as an incentive for thought and aim to involve the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, “there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump to the level it needs so much, thinking in a united spirit about its future”.
Regarding the future on which the Mayor of Rome emphasises: "It will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but it will look much further away", we see not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also the role it can and must play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, claiming to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had close relations (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam."
As the time of the election approaches, the attacks on Obama will increase.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama insolently believes he can win the highest public rights dignity of a nation of which two governors and five senators have been black so far."
These attacks are really meaningless; they are racist, of course, but they do not answer the question of whether he will be a good president, and then there are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant priority.
In this case, there are people who listen to their emotions, not their minds.
Inside the southern states, a Mississippi newspaper wrote in its editorial: we know well who the real American patriot votes for in the ballot box.
A side of American thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk whatever you want, and we'll know where to put it, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
No such words have ever been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these reasonings, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush’s term of office? 89 percent replied that Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was tipped to the bottom by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was a weak spot for Bush.
There's a huge task ahead for the man who replaces George W.
The U.S.: the economic collapse is felt by journalists, and the time has come in the newsrooms. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Now, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not clearly state that their concerns regarding credibility had been reduced.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsrooms, i.e. newspaper editors.
“If we don’t want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum in the sense that the general public understands it, this problem needs to be solved,” the journalists said.
Today, American journalism is characterized by visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior executives in print media are convinced that national journalistics are on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press has no difficulty in seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many believe to be the "murderer" of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” perceived by journalists has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they were voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit the journalistic community.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between editorial leaders, i.e. directors, and correspondents working for them.
At the national level, 56 percent of executives are confident that their correspondents share their information with others, while at the local level, this rate is only 23 percent.
Some people associate this with a secure job.
At the national level, 47% of managers are afraid of losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this figure is 30%.
In America, the question of "safe work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
In a vast nation like the United States with 300 million inhabitants, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TVs and Internet service providers, employers usually recommend as much as they want, so it works on a "must or not" basis.
Directors usually get a high salary, and editors can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year it is x days, and in the third year it is also until after a certain time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF JUSTICE IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, rejected the application of Danilo Coppola, who was active in the real estate industry, who wanted to move from his residence, Grottaferrata, to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the framework of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate professional go from the rural small town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow the company to influence its affairs and access the evidence against it.
The elites are at risk.
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has caused a break in the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between the traditional, restrained Eastern Coastal attitude supporting federal institutions and business circles and the growing new direction against the Washington and financial world in the central and southern states.
This line was expressed in a critical way during the vote in the House of Representatives mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the significant changes that the still ongoing economic reorganization predicts or allows to be seen, not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world, perhaps even outside it.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the phenomena that have been lurking for a long time, which are solidifying in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the re-updating, bringing back to public consciousness the dual category of state sovereignty, in connection with a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions that, although they have close links with the rest of the world, are, above all, and quite widely, bringing with them people and families living in one country, one state.
This, in turn, is a direct political difficulty for those in government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
So the crisis seems to be worldwide in an economic sense, but in a political sense it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially out of line: the European Union, which is not able to establish a uniform political direction between different interests and different national strategies, is an eloquent proof of this.
Thus, everyone expects the individual national governments to intervene, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but especially the opening of funds: because only individual states have economic resources, financial resources that may be able to make things right.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation will likely ever have to that extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation statehood is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things such as water, crops, and oil.
From things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, they are completely linked to a demarcated place, an area.
Thus, whoever dominates the area has much more cards than who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I would like to move on to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Anyone who states that territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, it seems that the economic crisis produces two congruent phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular, brings a total loss of credit to economic leaders, who have proved completely inadequate and have proved that many are still in the dark.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a sense, more disturbing: the feeling of loss of credit, impatience, inadequacy and separation, which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that a growing population is convinced that the time of the social elite at its peak has expired. It has expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the complex sense of the word, have become their own. This makes the social elite increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In a word, the demand for leadership, in a veiled form, feeds a diverse but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is manifested in unexpected "humbles" of voters, or in recent times in sudden changes in public mood. For example, the rise of conservatives to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of Labour unity in Britain, or the rebellion of American congressional representatives against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right is included).
It seems that the traditional elite, along with its parties, programs, and even its customs, press, and renowned intellectuals, are less and less able to understand, and therefore less and less able to represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper layers of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading and potentially able to create increasingly excessive emotions.
Despite all this, talking about "the imminent rebellion of the masses" would be, frankly, an exaggeration.
But walking with your eyes open doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk with super strong glue on the wall
With the help of a super-strong glue, you can defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several American research centers, and a group of four institutions are close to a solution.
With a piece of glue of just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal STUDY - Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of special materials with a nanotube structure of carbon n.
“We need to think of the principle of glue as a package of spaghetti-like pipe systems,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the foot of the gecko covered with microscopic folds, which gives the animal perfect grip.
Tests with various materials such as glass, teflon, and sandpaper have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles, but at the same time “it easily separates from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as a temporary glue," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe we can walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe we can, but researchers are thinking about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good at driving heat and electricity.
You can also find further applications in space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University, California, is also conducting experiments with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, scientists in California have presented a hairlike, microfibre adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning while moving on the surface, thus always providing perfect grip.
It's not allowed with juice.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high vitamin-containing, especially popular thirst-extinguishing drinks in summer, if they are introduced into the body together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or reducing their effect, as the case may be. This may also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks of the combined use of canned or fresh juices and certain medicines. The professor announced at the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thus preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient’s health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already been placed on the accused’s bench when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety-reducing, heart rhythm control and neuromedicine to toxic levels.
RISKED MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take the risks associated with this consumption seriously and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are prevented from being absorbed by grapefruit and other juices could be included.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at Milan State University, points out this: "Such discoveries are usually immediately indicated to various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, ensure that the data on the information provided by the given drug are changed.
That is why we should always read the information on the medicine we are about to take, and if something is not understandable, we should not let ourselves be influenced, but we should clearly ask our doctor or pharmacist," said an expert at the Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for the analysis of trade models and the territorial context of economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist in the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the fiercest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the September 2001 terrorist attack, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This prediction has provoked a lot of debate, it has been put on the eyes of the economist on several occasions, but we now know that it was accurate.
“I’m surprised, and a little shocked, at how quickly public interest went beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom,” Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "broken valuable economist", but at the same time he spreads his criticism of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration in a rather aggressive style."
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package was worth it
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is a personal productivity-enhancing, open-code application package that targets an increasingly wide range of users, from home to office users, from liberal professions to administration, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by SUN Microsystem and volunteer developers, the new Open Office introduces more new features to the public: in addition to the welcome screen and the redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it also offers several important innovations. For example, compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can also open Microsoft documents with a new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting is the specific function of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphic module, keeping the page location layout.
On the same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other's works. Each colleague's comment is marked in different colors, which helps to make it easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of the features of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version may be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, after being added to the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
On request, we can take the installation CD at home or at work.
Freeness is probably the biggest attraction in terms of the spread of the home application, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is also a lack of ideal education, consulting and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant word editor; Calc, spreadsheet to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 goal is to reach 5 million downloads. But if you consider that with the release of the new version, we are already at 3.6 million, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, again produced a positive sample, who won the best mountaineer shirt in addition to the bronze medal.
The news was published on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, after the Italian Riccardo Ricci and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test of the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like tests carried out in recent weeks, has been tested by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay Malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose his third place and, according to the regulations, will be banned from racing for two years.
The report on the positive results of Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and told Associated Press that he had indicated the positive doping result to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, as well as the polka dot shirt for the best mountaineer.
NEW YORK TIMES IS THE QUESTION ASKED, IS IT A RASSIST OF ITALY?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to one of the preferred destinations of reluctant immigrants.
This is the question that the New York Times is asking, based on the case of young Burkina Faso's Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "north paradox": in the northern regions, "the strongest integration and the highest employment" is at the same time "anti-immigrantism and support for the Northern League" is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also cites the cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins of immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, were also discussed as an example of a change in mood in Italy.
Both the Pope and the President of the Republic highlighted this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church cooperate to defeat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rents, it can cost up to 900 euros a room
The housing market for college students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such amazing proportions that, due to the large total costs for families, a wide range of students are blocked from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office. "In these cities, the high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of expensiveness has started against local residents."
In the majority of cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rental restrictions, with a related sub-lease.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices through the revision of the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, a bed is also charged EUR 450; the price of the single room ranges from EUR 650 (near Bande Nere) to EUR 800 ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can reach EUR 900 (near Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed place costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room costs about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where most of the students live in the vicinity of the university, a bed costs EUR 250/280 if it is double and EUR 370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single bed and 450 euros for a bed in a double room.
The prices are somewhat cheaper (550 euros for a single room) in the vicinity of other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitte).
You can save some money in suburban districts: a bed costs 300 euros and a single room costs 450 in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they charge 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price is the highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 euros for a bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often seek accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old movie halls is over in the cities
Traditional cinemas close for the benefit of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore are an effective representation of everything that takes place in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the loss of single-rooms in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When places full of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend going away, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says Cinema Paradiso director. The film, which 20 years ago was an Oscar award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival for Tornatore, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, the yearning, after a cinema experience that may have been lost forever.
The data published by Anec, the largest association of operators, speaks clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The biggest loss could have been recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront of the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that the expansion of multiplexes is responsible for their disappearance, and nothing proves it better than the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same number in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec president Paolo Protti. "It's okay to build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all walkers are willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the uncharged financial funds intended to support operators: the state's overdue debt is about EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
To maintain the market, it would require EUR 16-18 million a year."
The case of Bologna deserves special attention. This is the first Italian city that, in its concern about closures, decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost one-room cinemas in the foreign and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park in certain parking lots with reduced tariffs.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, must improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale, so that I don’t see the posters blacked out by the dust, I turn my head. I’ve had so many experiences here.”
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges were made by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal network.
Cuffs were placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as a lawyer nephew with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal network and was compensated for EUR 10 million.
"The disregard for all legal and moral rules, even good taste," the state's attorneys wrote. The two local governments declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to Piromalli's lawyer.
"Thus, the clan would have had official access to the city hall, which would have given us an additional opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the Assembly of the Calabrian Region, does not hide that there is "a number of collusion between local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean".
This morning's arrests are a continuation of the events in July, when the police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even then due to the alleged mergers between organized crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Christian Democrat mayor at the time of dissolution, was led by the centre-right coalition in the second round of 2006.
He shouted scandal when the County House ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He brought the then Deputy Minister of the Interior to justice Marco Minnini and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but in the arrest warrant signed this morning, the court explained that the Piromalli clan had ventured to demand a change in project A3.
The wiretaps ordered against Dal Torrione show that "it was willing to comply with the demands of an extensive entrepreneur representing a group known to be close to the Piromalli family, to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the clan interest."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is only now being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that have been targeted by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
They've been researching the possibility of getting energy from the movements of the sea for a hundred years, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the re-increase in oil prices give a new impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by facilities that exploit sea waves.
This is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement on a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies have voted for marine energy, including those who have been committed supporters of traditional energy so far.
“Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and considering working with us,” a spokesman for an associate company of the American oil giant, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a permit issued by the U.S. Energy Commission for the launch of the project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is of no small importance, especially considering that the US is currently producing oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a further drilling plan.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are on the way to extract energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as details can be known, are of increasing interest.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, this is still a rudimentary technology, even because energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, similar to those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, it is necessary to have facilities with a significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure turns on a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity goes to land on cables under the sea.
For now, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are just waiting for federal approval, some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started powering a shopping mall and parking lot with the help of six submarine turbines located in the East River Strait in New York.
At tides, the movement of water turns the blades of turbines, and this rotating movement feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are just waiting for permissions to use energy.
It's tidal after waves.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through tidal tides.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the tides. This amount is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
