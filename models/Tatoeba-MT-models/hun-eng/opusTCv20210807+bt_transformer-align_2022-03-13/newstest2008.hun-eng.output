European inflation has slipped on food
Accelerating inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in 13 countries in the euro area, with annual inflation recorded at 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the EU’s statistical office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent likely, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB) in the United States, the British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction, along with rising raw material prices and easing unemployment, would lead to an inflation spiral.
The ECB wants to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in its 22nd trap: “We need to talk down inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, inflation in November is a record of 3.3 percent for 12 years; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1.
Euro zone inflation has been driven by rising food and energy prices.
Future wheat quotations increased by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached the highest value since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
Oil prices on the world market rose 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
Analysts say the 12-month inflation rate will remain at around 3 percent in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB has reduced interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support circle increased significantly by the beginning of December, so it has now had the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such a low, 13 percent socialist support.
For certain party electors, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would mean more than two thirds (71%) of support against one fifth (20%) of MSZP's support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is two percent.
The supporters of both camps are one percent more among the sure-voting party voters.
Economic sentiment has continued to deteriorate to the previous low - it has never been so high, 41 percent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while another 46 percent said it was quite bad.
Families now judge the change in their own financial situation more pessimisticly after more hopeful prospects in spring and summer.
For the following year, the larger half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth of improvement.
In December, more than all previous Gallup surveys, 71 percent of respondents, believed that the Prime Minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the supporters.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all, 27 percent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of society thinks that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 percent considered it desirable to remain the government and the head of government, at present this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees only the solution in issuing new elections.
It is typical of the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answer the question of willingness to participate that they would be sure to leave, and another 20 percent say that they would probably leave.
In comparison, only 55 percent would be sure to take part in a "now Sunday parliamentary election" and an additional 15 percent would consider their participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent would say no to visiting fees, and 84 percent would say no to hospital daily fees.
If we look at the same percentages only among those who promise to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visa fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, with nearly a fifth raised by Tesco
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 percent last year, except that VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
On average, the daily Christmas basket in the Budaörs trade triangle increased by 16 percent this year, but in each hypermarket there was an increase in value of well above HUF thousand.
Since prices in food stores had already "disappeared" in December last year, there was no drastic increase compared to the previous high base.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they received last year was well below 9,000 forints, they will not even get it now for 10,000 forints.
The Daily basket in the examined hypermarkets crossed the ten thousand HUF psychological limit by at least 91 HUF.
The highest basket value was HUF 10 573.
(In 2003, the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and live fish almost remained at last year's level, but turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy were also very expensive.
The price of flour and bread was followed by the KSH data in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-litre redeemable bottle was below 200 HUF, so together with the deposit fee they only asked for 257 HUF for the product.
However, Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily Basket this year, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased prices by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices in the Daily Basket by about 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket value, the difference was 12 percent, while the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive was 21 percent.
On average, there were 1480 increases in forints.
Last year, the average price increase came out to HUF 1206, so that last Christmas the VAT increase had an impact on prices.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, apparently the stores were unable to decide how much margin to apply to each product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of rotation of a product is poorly planned by the trader, there may be a serious profit on the margin adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily Basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive was HUF 1720 more than the value of 2006, while the price difference was only HUF 844 more than the cheapest.
This year, this extreme did not show itself, as the most expensive was 1630 HUF more than last year, and the cheapest was also 1284 HUF more expensive.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices, with daily consumer goods increasing by more than 30% in hypermarkets in less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not necessarily justify the data of the HCSO: the statistical office measured a price increase of more than 30 percent over 12 months for some basic foods.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product already quite expensive last year produced a price increase of less than 10% compared to the base in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the eggmen, and they managed to fool the drastic increase in price levels on the multinationals.
In the trading gold triangle, the hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, most of the customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantities of everything, they carry long-lasting foods.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines in front of the cashiers because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that there is less traffic in the countryside, and more multi-companies complain to research companies that there is even less revenue than their plans, not only for food, but also for durable consumer goods.
They save on disinfectants in many places
This year, more than 1,000 infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds and the overload of staff do not favour stopping infections, says the head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of John’s Hospital.
After a serious accident, a man was found to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
There was a similar infection at the beginning of the year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery has not been performed since then because of the bacteria in his system.
This year, by December 10, 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, and the rest is unknown.
About two thirds (683 infections) of infections were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
A third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly resistant bacteria that spreads rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, when the immune system is temporarily or permanently impaired, it may cause serious hospital infections such as wound infection or sepsis in elderly or low body weight patients.
According to the medical director of John’s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections belong to the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the disease, MRSA is only not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resistant to antibiotics
"We isolate such patients, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the right antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are pre-examined to see if MRSA is present in their bodies, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable for preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should check patients entering and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in this, that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these tests.
Most cases will thus come to light if the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the head of department at the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections and pathologies.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always comply with this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another through the mediation of medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA spreads with droplet infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, the wards are often crowded, and the beds are often very close to each other, even though from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, we can also experience, noted Karolina Böröcz, that in hospitals in an unfavorable financial situation they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses, there are many patients, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is less infection or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection causes huge expenses for health insurance companies, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, for example, it included the prevention and reduction of MRSA in the government programme.
The program appears to be successful, and according to the data published, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the prevention of the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
The police officer who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII Police Commissioner has been prepared.
There is no way that he would have been driving drunk or intoxicated in the meantime, the XXII. district police captain, who hit a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the expert opinion on this was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the primary test result, which already concluded that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he sat behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district station hit the 55-year-old man who did not want to cross the road to the other side of the road with his own car while cornering Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII. district.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not an easing circumstance according to the rules of the CRES, the turning driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because the case shocked him so much.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Investigative Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors who carried out the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit lines supporting education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in Hungary in 2006, of which 100 million loans have already been concluded by the parties, and the now signed contract is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
Education-related projects are also financed by the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later by extending the loan contract.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, metro 4 was also mentioned.
They agreed that when Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans is provided by the EIB with an 8-year grace period linked to EURIBOR and without a maintenance commission.
Bulgaria the EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed to the Balkan country, which has been mentioned little.
What, where and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate shopping destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balcsik.
Analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria say that sooner or later the central part of the country will attract investors - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people will buy around the particularly cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golf havens, making it a priority destination in addition to the summer and winter seasons in the other two seasons.
Foresight investors are therefore already buying big, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy renovated properties for between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or destroy old houses for between 5 and 15 thousand euros, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to a big city, shops and, in general, to a local doctor.
The second category belongs to holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who purchase in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of capital properties is constantly increasing as demand is increasing.
Although Bulgaria has the lowest house prices in the European Union, they have increased by 21% per year in the last five years.
The rise in property prices is substantially higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set out in the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
This is currently being debated between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question of the conference is whether developed countries will undertake, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
There has also been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of 16 members, expected to be within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), according to the Market and Profit.
6 percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to preserve its flagship role in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU will commit to a 20% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to take up to 30 percent reduction if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to take on commitments in accordance with their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol set a total reduction of 5.2 percent, including the EU - 15 Member States at the time - took up minus 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is a 6 percent greenhouse gas emission reduction compared to the 1985-87 period, which Hungary will meet.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate policy agreement must be concluded within two years, otherwise its entry into force would surely be delayed beyond 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by another international emission reduction system, the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize winner, international scientific body on climate change, pointed out in its latest report.
By doing so, emissions reductions would be delayed and an increase in the Earth’s average temperature above 2 Celcius degrees would be inevitable, which scientists believe would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
Photographs of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan will be published on the video sharing by British army units to promote themselves.
For the first time, the British Air Force (RAF) caught YouTube: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC said.
These miniature, helmet-mounted cameras are checked at the Air Force Operation Command in Kandahar and then sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 recordings on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos of both actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Commonwealth Office and Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Deployment in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention, he posted the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also good for making the public aware of the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this form will cost almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements, said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but it inevitably also carries some political message, as it justifies the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
The army also has a problem with the fact that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are added to the divider, which, for example, also represent the death of soldiers: in slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers maximum talk about losses, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos from the Iraq and Afghanistan battlefields have already been posted on the Internet, which were made in live missions, but the British army has only recently caught up with it.
The Americans recruit in a slightly different way, with the free download of America's Army shooting game, in which the player can become a soldier in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It'll be a Christmas party at the Ministries.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who owe them cake and coffee from 2007.
There are some ministries where there's going to be a live music party, somewhere else with raffles and toasts, they put a Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how the power is fun.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party of the Ministry is held by the Defence Ministry this year, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry's employees.
On Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, on Mission Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, but there is also a press reception.
The wallet allocates 25 million to the mood at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are firing me from the harness compared to other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4 320 000 and about three hundred and fifty guests from the 600 ministry employees.
At the ceremony of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas mood, but there will be performers and raffles.
The Christmas of the NFÜ cost HUF 4 700 000, and it was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinners.
The room rental cost a million forints, and the remaining part was spent on more than 400 guests.
As we know, one department of the NFÜ is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
The building of the Vígszínház was rented for the purpose.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt. as we failed to reach the competent one.
No need for a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca Day Ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask them for money to use the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and after dinner it was possible to dance to live music.
To his [origo] question, it was said that at the ball there was no obligation to wear evening clothes or suits at all.
The health, labour and municipal wallets are set up for a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and ceremony for workers in its own building for HUF 400,000.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for a year-end workshop.
They expect one hundred and eighty guests, who, the press department said, will only receive coffee and cake, so the party will be brought out of HUF 350 000.
Minister Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas party in its own large hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
2500 HUF per guest is allocated for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, every year the employees of the PM have a similar Christmas.
However, there will be no party mood, the officiality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon date.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Városliget, and according to the wallet, 1000 HUF is allocated to the hundred guests per person.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple standing reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial greeting and end with a restrained snack.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not having a Christmas party at all, they told [origo] in the relevant press departments.
They couldn't tell the price of the environmental ministry's official Christmas in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party, which is held at the Museum of Artists.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a protest general assembly will be held, and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act, the cessation of work will begin.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will almost completely stop and strike at BKV for 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present the details of their Monday strike with the National Federation of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday the organisations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the start of the strike has not been marked - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if they vote in favour of the legislation, the strike committees will meet and decide to continue.
Based on the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions in transport can be expected: work at the railway will be stopped indefinitely, some of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volán companies, may stop in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a semi-track road closure in many parts of the country.
The strike call has been joined by a number of trade unions and NGOs, the list of which is constantly updated in the League's country.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period, others have announced temporary cessation of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient service, even though as Christmas holidays approached, more and more people were travelling by rail.
According to the previous announcements, the LIGA Electrical and Heat Industry Trade Unions will strike at BKV from the start of operation until 13 a.m., between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers will hold a four-hour strike.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationally at alternate times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector of the SZEF (EDDSZ) holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws the proposal for the reform of health insurance and put a new concept into social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new method of calculating pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of entering the system in the case of early retirement already before 2010 in the case of worthy jobs.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) belonging to the League Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport for railway wing lines, waiting for a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard raises country’s risk
With the support of Jobbik Hungary Movement, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded in August of this year, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
In the company's "risk warning", they wrote that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Gypsy population in Hungary can develop violent ethnic clashes in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this can be traced back to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "the public debate on the Roma issue was handed over by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Gypsy-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, mainly as regards faith in the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that from the autumn of 2006, it was part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary that received increasing publicity and momentum, that from the summer of 2007 several organisations calling themselves "national self-defense" associations were formed in Hungary.
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as NGOs, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members, even armed ones, for defence (catastrophic, defence, law enforcement) tasks, and also on the grounds of the inadequacy of the police, the army, the state," they added.
They noted that this is done in accordance with the method of putting various political aspirations in civilian robes based on the political and anti-partisanism of society.
The emphasis on civility and the form of association therefore serve not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration in the case of these associations, but also as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and the ultranationalist political actors of some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, the establishment of which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass Roma riots that broke out in a quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU took advantage of this decision to establish a guard, saying that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defense".
“In the last 17 years, there has been a ‘Gypsy terror’ in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent,” he said.
They added that the initiative provoked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they are creating their own guard as a resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will respond to the threat in the same way by organising their own self-defense, read the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said to the interest of the telegraph office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish their risk analysis every year, and if they experience something that may affect the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It's not a red-letter holiday everywhere.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays it has become a common practice to rearrange the working day, from which there will be less next year.
The holiday is not united in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly linked to church holidays and outstanding historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are public holidays - the latter only so that New Year's Evemakers can rest.
We have a total of 11 red letters all year round.
National holiday is also the Memorial Day of the 1956 Revolution, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848 and 23 October.
On August 20th, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our relatives and friends who died.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are two-day holidays.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work-school on the previous Saturdays.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been regulated by a separate decree on the exact day immediately before or after the holiday.
The legislation covers all employers and their employees, civil servants and those in the public service relationship.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays as a result of its purpose.
This year only around the end of the year holidays changes the work schedule: from 24 December life in the country almost stops, as experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slipped" by the majority of people or used for this purpose their saved freedom.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle and at the end of the week, so there will be fewer workday relocations than this year.
First, the calendar is transformed around the celebration of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days.
The Saturday on 26 April will be a working day in exchange for Friday's rest on 2 May.
The other transfer is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year can be completely in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from 24 December almost everywhere a non-stop break is held even if the New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Disturbing Things You Can Do to Annoy Your Colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never get, innocent lies that we almost no longer notice: they "color" everyday life at work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or put on gloves and consciously avoid misunderstood situations that cause annoyance to others.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the marketing department," one of your colleagues said.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
At best, he regrets and tries to make it right, perhaps he calls the marketing department to tell you that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less conventional solution).
Most of the time, it's taken care of with an apology.
Before you make an embarrassing apology, it is worth considering what it is that can give your colleagues unpleasant minutes and consciously strive to avoid it.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or your phone, and that's nowhere to be found.
Remember you put your stapler on the table yesterday, but by morning, you had your feet on the table?
Perhaps you will discover your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they'll be right to be angry at you for riding their property.
Don’t put pockets of office envelopes, post-it, because it can be uncomfortable if it runs out prematurely and you need it immediately.
Are you gossiping about your colleagues' privacy?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did you do?
Where and why?
Don't put your assumptions about the privacy of your colleagues on everyone's nose.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Bury what you hear and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence, even if others know about your colleague’s things.
Are you reporting unreasonably ill?
When you call the office and report a patient with a slush headache, because you feel bad or feel like you’d rather rest that day; think about the fact that your work, your urgent tasks, your futures work should be done by someone else instead of you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you are not going to go into the office the next day, or something may come up that you need to stay at home, signal that your colleagues and your boss will not face your absence the next day.
Humping, giggling, making calls
You're deep into work, but you're being dragged out of it by the giggling of colleagues?
Have you unwittingly become an earwitness to a phone conversation that would have been better off not hearing?
Do not disturb your colleagues with bulging, singing, loud conversation (which you continue over their heads), foot beating, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
These can all be confusing, even if they are not deep into a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If you don't have time, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don't blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos that may prevail in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you've made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage to someone else, and eliminate the damage.
Ask yourself how you can make up for your mistake and make up for it.
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Bears and slippers: comfortable to wear for home, but not for the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes even if your job allows you to.
Don't be smug, your colleagues, and respect yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes - if your job requires it, neatly and elegantly!
If you want to live up to it, you're no longer interesting.
Harvesting the car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio there is a special melody: the sound of the violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music changes tempo and the bass arrives next to the previous sounds, and then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love is on mr2.
For a long time, Hungarian music life has not pampered us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like there's a whole different plug when you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground slowly change the overall picture, and despite the fashion of guitar threshing garage rock, the Hungarian electropop also proves that there is a new under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi's band until - perhaps because two honks couldn't fit in a csárda - he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, he began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Török Ferenc Season).
The formations of the first smaller clubs were introduced to a wider audience when wan2 magazine classified their first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, in the company of Yonderboi, was declared almost the only Hungarian trendmakers who seemed marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better album.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new ways for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial years of Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer's old band there.
With the airy, flying reference, we would be on the spot, but in addition to the airiness of music, the influence of the louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the age, has now appeared.
In these songs, György Ligeti, a singer currently working with The Puzzle band in England, presented himself at the Millenáris premiere of the album.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and from morning to evening, Mr2 Petőfi, who played popular music, began to smuggle into the ears the great melodies of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
All is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: With this new hit, the question now arises: how much layer music do you have left to play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of popular music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, meaningless, and can be prepared for sale in the same way, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from an honest motivation.
The attitude of the recipient also operates in this spirit, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
There are not only the eleven-to-twenty-year-olds who go to concerts, but also the older ones.
Rather, they monitor the popular music changes around them, because they are also considered part of contemporary culture.
Q. What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not for purpose, but for some reason.
Rather, the role of the audience can be perceived at concerts, where the interaction already works, but this only lies in the elusive changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How much do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo and built his career further west of us.
Zs.B.: We don't really go his way, regardless of how they sometimes try to explain it to our music.
We’re more of a team player who trusts the other person’s musical presence and lets it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi's music, as many of us separated from his orchestra and started on another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on the top list of Mr2 Petőfi.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Are you consciously open to a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, with which we tried to dissolve the sound organ and the more difficult themes on the album.
How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came to make this choir from the good-sounding soloists of our own home music scene.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - came together, which was then named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song exactly like this designed or shaped by the girls?
Zs.B.: The number had long existed in an instrumental version, and then when the disk material came together, we thought that this number would need something else.
It was the chord procession that attracted me to put a song on it.
That night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first time and frighteningly spontaneous.
I remember he was very excited at the time, but of course he needed the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), no role of their own, they sing completely together and are not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was purely due to technical problems.
It is clear that we did not want to share solo roles.
That's what my mouth is about to forget our egos a little bit, who came from where, where he's going, just let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
Q. Which was the most work done?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the pieces were heavier than mixing than the musical creative process.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a tournament piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then slowly everything came into its place, like in a puzzle game.
Q. What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "let go" of the album.
Now Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The traitorous broker risked billions because of a feeling of inferiority
Unfaithful embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost EUR 5 billion.
However, it seems that Kerviel was not untalented at all, but rather a great player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's less mentally capable," said his superiors who informed the police.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s testimony shows that at the end of last year he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was news that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for customers with low income or repayment problems in the past.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in that and he put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits and adds that he didn't keep anything to himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he forged his reports in such a way that it could not be revealed.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his transactions.
The risk was a gain.
Were you afraid you'd find out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them."
How did he have the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at the Société Générale bank since 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and became an independent broker with a salary of $90,000 a year in 2005.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, I knew in my first conversation that they were looking at me with a bad eye.
My education, my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his entry, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he earned half a billion euros in the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses were supposed to know, or rather suspected, everything.
"As long as I made money, they turned a blind eye."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend he wanted to cover it up in mid-January.
When he left for work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
“I only took four days last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look into his reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has 365 billion chances
The Czech government’s ministers and representatives of the European Commission have signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic will be able to raise EUR 14 billion (about 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
The Czech Republic is about half of the total amount that can be obtained from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion kroner of seven operational programmes are allocated to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion kroner from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is for transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund of the Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in obtaining EU funds so far.
Nicaraguan ex-president approves 20-year prison sentence
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud worth $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be returned to prison again is unclear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will depend on the prison leadership whether they let Aleman's sentence be served at home or whether he goes back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
In reality, these fictitious companies and their account numbers belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds were then made by a foundation founded to finance Alemán's 2001 election campaign.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This year, it passed with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow non-acceptance.
Unlike the loud debate before the vote on distrust of the government, this time there was no drama.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, although most influential, law.
This is a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends at each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the government and the opposition powers.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why it receives much more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of these is the high proportion of the mandatory, so-called payer expenditure law, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of .S.D. and KS.M. before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are a deficit in the budget of cities and districts.
Many mayors can raise money for investments other than taxes, levies and bank loans, often issuing bonds with which their town halls are disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
They don't have that kind of source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we shall establish that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt, managed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is a great shame for previous governments.
We belong to countries that are least threatened by poverty by global standards.
There is therefore no need, for example, for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have grown to a gigantic size in recent years completely unnecessary.
Although this year we managed to eliminate part of the meaningless populist spending approved before the elections, even if the retirement limit and pension reform will not be pushed out in the near future, then in this country any policy and whoever governs will actually end.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that most of the taxed money from governing politicians usually becomes their pension and social benefits become their mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by expenditure on principals.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not wasted everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not really want to have mere officials from governing politicians, we must be patient and have peace of mind to prepare further reform laws for this not-so-strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only issue what it can get from taxes and levies.
These are the only things that make it possible to achieve a balanced budget gradually.
Jisí Krejsí
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
Money markets cost more than $100 billion through stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, the interest rate on the bank is increased, for which they are ready to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will put $40 billion on the stock exchange and make another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time after the attacks on 11 September, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest problems in the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, a consulting firm at Economic Outlook Group, wrote in a report to his clients.
“The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion mainly in the United States because of unrepaid loans.
Analysts expect additional billions of dollars in losses.
“Central banks can really fear what might happen if they decided to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
The situation seems to be really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce the need and plunge the US economy into recession with its possible consequences for the economic growth of the whole world.
The central banks decided this after the failure to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank supply rate, which is used for money lending in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of lending mutual money, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and Great Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
“This will have a similar effect to a further fall in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' action will contribute to averting the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
His book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, said that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a special mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality accompanying it.
“The debate there absolutely lacks structure, it’s just throwing words, which are a substitute for solving current problems,” Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it is very important to him and that is why he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book is also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only caricatures of my opinion".
So now the interested ones can read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climate scientist, he believes that he has enough foundation to write such a book.
As an academic able to monitor and judge professional studies, he has experienced statistics and economists.
To conclude the book, he indicated as a thesis that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. that its changes are normal, and that all scientists do not agree on the warming of the planet that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so they do not pose a threat, and that the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions on others to be unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against the rational protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people were unable to change their driving licenses
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver's license in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when they can still apply for an exchange so that the offices can issue the new driver's license in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers would leave without a valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the driver's license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While districts represent a sharp fall in interest in licence exchanges, capital offices have been flooded with applications for licence exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, the driver’s license was not replaced by about 140,000 drivers.
A new driver's license will last for 20 days.
However, the new licence can be applied for with a shortened deadline of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay an extra 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to complete the mandatory change of driving licence by the end of the year and start driving with an invalid licence will be punished from January.
The criminal must pay a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
However, the police may settle the offence by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on previous information from City Hall, you can also get a fine for someone who doesn't travel anywhere.
He's supposed to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
Earlier, the Ministry called on the offices to be lenient and to impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport spokesperson Karel Hanzelka, however, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
A driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an ID card that must be valid for everyone.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It's enough to take it or send it by mail to the right office.
At the end of the year, the licenses issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually replace the other types of driving licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 can replace it for another three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court lowers sentence for Berdycchel co-operated investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kocacík, suspected of teaming up with David Berdych's criminal network, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
This was decided by the Supreme Court of Prague with final effect, which thus reduced their sentences to one of them and to the other by two years.
Investigators of the Organized Crime Division in Prague were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first judgment.
In other proceedings, he has already been punished for more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of robbery, of which the Supreme Court today heard 16 appeals.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation by saying it was a speculative matter.
According to the Central Bohemia Senate, police members after the agreement with Berdyc, among other things, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robbery attacks and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
The gang therefore sold 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Kocacík.
In the indictment, we're talking about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are primarily robberies whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the powers of a public official and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because the police illegally held pistols, steel-core bullets, laser sightings, or machine guns during search warrants.
The gang is accused of taking tens of millions of crowns with the robberies.
The gang of less than one of twenty members has already been convicted by the courts of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment testify in other proceedings before the court, some cases have not yet been brought to justice.
So far, the first instance trial has avoided Tomá a Puta and Maro aulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
For the children traded in obstetrics, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, demands 12 million kroner of pain from the hospital in T.ebí.
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and a million for children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ond-ej Dostal Veleba, fundamentally disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject such a demand because it's too much," Dostal said after today's trial.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll determine if it has any usable value at all.
But we maintain our opinion that this will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K a.m. for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablosov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was criticised by experts on the basis of compensation negotiations, which was developed by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, children’s parents suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they encountered such reproach that they did not prevent the exchange of newborns.
Women cope worse with the actuality of the trauma they have experienced and what is happening right now, he summed up the content in Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were traded by nurses at the birth in T aebí on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola .ermák in P.ibyslavice, Veronika Libor Bro and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
At the end of October, the district leader of Vyso aina, Milo a Vystr ail, handed over 100,000 kroner to the families to replace their expenses, which were caused by the mistake of the hospital in T aebí aske, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance from the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach into the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they may ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, calculating the amounts on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million kroner.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valasko
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Vala asko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name King of Valach, the project was developed by a team of years of work around Tomá a Harabi a working with the actor.
Polívka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabic and his team preying on the popularity of Polívka Bolek," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, everyone thinks of the actor-comic.
This opinion is also shared by Harabic.
“We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing actions," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
Years later, they realized that the project was successful and they could gain something from it.
They want to feed on our work," he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name of King Valachi was first used by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohat.
At that time, however, this was not related to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabic came up with the idea of issuing Valchi passports.
The original student prank operation turned into a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabic then based the creation of the society of the Kingdom of Vala asko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to indicate his name and signature on passports and even offered their owners discounts when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabic himself used the idea, which Polívka published in Manes for his business.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity has certainly helped the Kingdom of Valachi project," the judge said.
However, he added that the soul of the project was the intensively engaged Harabic and his team.
The cooperation of the now-controversial parties continued until 2000, when Harabic organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have accumulated between Polívka and Harabic, which have resulted in the exoneration of "the forever elected King Boleslav I".
The leading role in the kingdom was taken over by Jarmila .ulaková as queen of the mother.
In 2002, he then brought a court action against Polívka Harabic and his associates, which was rejected today by the court.
Light in the debate could be brought to the throne and half of the princess by the battle planned by Harabic.
This battle should make him a new king.
He didn't want to tell me the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the King's march in Slovacko.
The king should be elected for a definite period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply calmly," added Harabic.
Test of the 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: Disappearing Prejudices
Honestly, I never liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the march are nothing special, the quality of the change, the leadership and the production can often be described as below average.
But his successor, Peugeot 207, already present on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further, so for me, all I have to do is think more.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the place left to the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaint is over here, because the body of the station wagon means that in this regard, the giants two meters high do not suffer anymore.
Fast in the world
In the interior, I quickly get through so that I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively good design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, since the exterior of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
The lateral driving also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
In the station wagon, the few places of the head already mentioned disappear.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing in this vehicle is therefore its luggage compartment.
This should be considered very accessible (and thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tires, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they can be pulled apart and they can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume a little bit.
This is based on tables in the basic layout of 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after car of this class - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the product of the new generation in Mladá Boleslav, we will find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 liters.
This value is almost critical for a foreign holiday or for the insertion of a stroller.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backrests of the second row were folded or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6 l four-cylinder, non-ignition engine with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the one thousand six hundred that drives the family hatchback should look like.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption and it's mainly pulling.
If we compare it to the equivalent of Akoda, which often acts as if a rag had been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
The price whispers
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car still leaves with a four-cylinder foreign engine for 329 900 K-2.
The car starts from 410 990 K a.m., which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws the equipment at an additional 80,000 K-4.
But we also had head airbags, automatic climate, automatic wiper start, rear windows electric remote control....
That is, the car costs 531 900 K a.m. with a tok and a tow.
This is a lot, but count the additional equipment of Fabia and you will get a very similar result.
There is no other choice but to make a decision for the brand.
Unsuccessful integration of Slovak students in British schools
In British schools, there are an increasing number of children in Eastern Europe, which causes concerns among locals about the further development of local school affairs.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
The quarrels and quarrels between the students already characterize the relations of the parents.
The situation has gone so far as to the fact that in Chatham the police have arrested a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by insulting him with racist curses.
Police had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls allegedly scolded the man with racist comments and threw stones at him.
When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he struck us with apples and pears and then revealed his naked butt,” the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents classified disputes about immigrants in Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks looking for jobs.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
The golden and white shores, high waves or sea, calm as a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean islands, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
During the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure warehouse and a transhipment site that was robbed and transported to Europe by the Spaniards in America.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, a boss of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily Prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
For example, there were guests
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tower houses were built in Havana, cars became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century on the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of American show business.
And today?
You can sign the Bodeguita wall in Havana.
In the bar of the dear Nacional Hotel, they'll make you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And the cult cars of the '50s still travel in Havana, because the once exported gigulis and your son long ago rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana is largely destroyed, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere else in the area as there are.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the necessary money, its development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been built not only in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines operating there, whose contemporaries can only be seen elsewhere in museums.
Which way to go?
Most of Cuba's most famous places are not avoided.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss visiting this museum.
The valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from limestone.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and a fertile soil is gathered in their cavities, thanks to which the scattered cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spaniards.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-great city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plain and the sea is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That kind of isolation helped him stay an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break down, everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón coast or the Sugar Factory Valley.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music will not be quiet until morning.
Baracoa
The town in eastern Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and divided mountains, leading through the nature almost barely affected by human activity.
Thanks to the untouched nature there, UNESCO added Cuba's eastern land language to the World Heritage List.
Here he makes his best chocolate, in the church he has the cross of Columbus (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailed) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today the El Castillo hotel stands, some of which are the most famous of which are El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meatro plains, Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, Santeria, African religion, which is professed by the descendants of former slaves, can be written a lot about this.
As they say, it is better to see it once.
Afghanistan’s allies are passive, the Americans say.
Few soldiers and lack of necessary equipment influence the course of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Minister Robert Gates said NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the southern part of the country have agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also discuss further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, with the help of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called for more activity this week by NATO troops, Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development assistance as a priority.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to start further developing the economy and security themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of Afghan insurgents has been strongest in the last five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in Helmand's southern province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the southern regions.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they asked for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We need to seriously think about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” . . .
In a similar spirit, Jaap de Hoop, Secretary General of NATO, spoke today.
“I’m not happy about what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been debates among the participating countries on whether all allies in Afghanistan are offering the maximum.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
“The German population is relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the least violence and combat requirements are not as high against them as they are against us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan sundiggers have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government debt reaches one trillion in 2009
For each Czech, there are 84,000 kroner public debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroner thanks to better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, this has increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
From June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance confirmed its government debt data from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 kroner in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroner.
“For now, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit next year, we could only exceed the one-trillion-kroner limit in 2009.
The next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion kroner," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek of the iHNed.cz server.
Vladimír Pikora, an analyst at Next Finance, sees this in a similar way: "In 2009, we can cross a trillion crossings.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget unknown to date.
If it were proven that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, which could be postponed until 2010.
But I don’t expect that change,” he said.
Growing Debts
Public debt consists of the debts of the central government, which is primarily formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed by cashiers' tickets, public loan bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has increased by 38,5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
For the time being, the state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called saleable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“All-year debt rose by 13% in the first quarter, which is actually quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be what to trade when the pension reform is here,” Pikora commented.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly the deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kroner instead of the assumed 91.3 billion kroner this year.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency's planned maximum resource of kroner 13.3 billion, the reserve of ten billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of public loan bonds of kroner 43 billion and the repayment of loans of kroner 1.8 billion from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in a court in Khartoum because of a name given to a teddy bear
A Khartoum court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country in Sudan on Thursday night for violating Islam, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad, but the Islamic religion forbids any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested on Sunday in her own apartment. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rebellion after the parents of the students complained against her several times at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
"The children proposed eight names in total, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohamed," said school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, by voting, 20 out of 23 children chose the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a joint diary with the picture of the bear and the inscription "My name is Muhammad".
The problem lies rather in the fact that any representation of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
A Muslim colleague of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school, said that he knew him well and that the teacher would never have done anything that would violate any religious conviction. According to him, it is only an "innocent mistake": "I only regret having the children vote for the name".
Many of the teacher's students agree with this opinion, saying that the teacher is "very good with children" and "he never talks about religion in class".
Remember that Mohammed is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name so often chosen by Muslim families is a way of expressing respect for the prophet. (Often this name is given to the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last meeting in Vienna on Wednesday.
The end result is failure.
The meeting between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians on Wednesday morning on the future status of the separatist province in Baden, Austria, ended without approaching the positions.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on status," Wolfgang Ischinger, EU diplomat, said at a press conference in Vienna.
The US ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There is no need to fear violence in the near future, but it is a very difficult time," he added, stressing the existence of "obvious tensions".
Mediation ends on December 10.
On Monday, the European Union, the United States of America and Russia will be visited for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo by an intermediary troika.
The future of the 90% Albanian province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and final meeting of the negotiations since the UN commissioned the troika to mediate again in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation task will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already thwarted Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
“Russia was and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise,” said Bocan-Harchenko.
One-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years under the control of the United Nations, the Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was prepared to unilaterally declare her independence if the Security Council did not decide in her favor.
Belgrade will continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we failed to reach an agreement," Kosovo's president, Fatmir Sejdiu, said at a hotel in Baden where "the last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and the future Prime Minister of the province, also expressed regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be "a continuation of the past that led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible, and he warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade fears a "domino effect" in an unstable region due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not rule out the possibility of compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has the right to veto.
“The Kosovo parliament will have the last word.”
“For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They have to end at the same place they started: the Security Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that "the Kosovo parliament will have the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians is based on "conciliation" with the Western powers.
Bush calls for agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to enter into negotiations immediately to finalise 60 years of dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every way possible in order to sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate “terrorist networks” and Israel must stop its colonial activities, Bush said, and reminded the two parties of their obligations regarding the “peace schedule” adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Abbas-led Palestinian Authority and Israel aim to “sign a peace treaty with which all pending problems are resolved, including central issues”.
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived in the territory of today's Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the US President, insisted that future negotiations be “global and profound” and touch on all areas of regulation, such as Jerusalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security.
Then Olmert, who entered the platform, promised that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous", and he would strive to "end them in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out to achieve the vision of the Palestinian and Israeli "two states" that exist side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
With the support of all Arab countries, Saudi Arabia (whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington) initiated a plan to guarantee peace to Israel in exchange for withdrawing from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a choice in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is usually the case with such news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first figures of the investigation launched by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 17 o'clock.
"The car was patrolling, so it wasn't in action. It was moving at a speed of 40-50 km/h, without sirens," we found out from a police source.
The young man without two helmets was driven at "high speed" with a green engine "not included in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) Kawasaki brand.
“Because they didn’t follow the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car,” a police officer said.
The results of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle were negative.
It shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car is dented, the windshield is cracked in the form of a star, and the bumper is torn off.
In an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning, Pontoise's Attorney General Marie-Thér-se de Givry said that he had entrusted the IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation, which was launched "because of negligence in manslaughter and failure to provide assistance".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told a press conference that police responsibility could be excluded at the current stage of the IGPN investigation.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses interrogated by the accident on Sunday evening confirmed "the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, from a strip that was undoubtedly pulled by the footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were stuck together and were moving together for a while until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been seized for the purpose of a technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were examined yesterday by a medical examiner.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, there was a rumor in Villiers-le-Bel that the police left the scene quickly without helping the two young people.
In this regard, the IGPN is cautious, but it excludes that the police have made "any serious mistake".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires an even more thorough investigation, and in doing so, special caution," we learned from a police source.
The Libération met a witness who reported on the few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of your apartment looks right at the scene.
“My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, went down immediately to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a police officer who was completely confused and limped.
The other two tried to revive one of the young people, and the fourth called."
There was an increasing tension among those present, as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the arriving police drove their colleagues off the scene.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also used heart massage, but in vain.
“I wouldn’t say that the police didn’t try to help young people.
Young people did get help.
Firefighters immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension increases in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations after the state of emergency introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures introduced during the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers have been made.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded the lawyers.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers on the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan in the central part of the country and in Peshawar in the northwest.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has been supported by the vast Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. Its leader "incited the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who took an oath before Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court will have to declare the legality of President Musarraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the president told The News.
President Pervez Musarraf’s promise to leave the army to take on the role of civilian president after the introduction of the state of emergency has “lost”, the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, announced on Monday.
Musarraf had to part with the military uniform until 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has refuted the rumours that President Musarraf would have been appointed a forced residence by his deputy general.
More than one-third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
More than a third (36%) of pregnancies are still unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined) 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or unplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablets or bee spirals, still fail in 5 to 6 percent of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between 20 and 44 years of age took contraceptive pills in 1970, but today this proportion is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plans with a few months of accuracy, and if possible, by spring, since this is the most favorable season for receiving a child.
Spectacular repairs to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of the broken solar panel essential to the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space walk proved to be a record in several ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be done away from the residential modules with tools "made" by astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, it is necessary to ensure their power supply.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move one module producing electricity using 17.5 tonnes of solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to its final place.
Then the crew began to open the module's 76 - meter - wide solar panels.
This is when one of the harmonica foldable boards was violated by a stuck cable in a length of about 1 m.
In order to avoid further damage, the opening of the board was not continued.
Astronauts were originally tasked with taking a check-up walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repairing another solar panel with a malfunctioning rotational system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to do the stunt on the 30-metre robot arm attached to the crane of the station.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
He's tall, he's strong, he's extremely skillful, he's muscular, he's got a long arm.
So the 46-year-old man with a medical degree had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with some "rails".
In his work, he was helped by another "spacewalker" who remained near the safe passageway, as well as by other astronauts inside, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick equipped with insulation against the voltage of hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "made" by the station's astronauts.
After completing the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions opened the board completely and then packed his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day rest, and today seven of them returned to the Discovery shuttle to begin their return home on Wednesday.
EADS share prices are falling
The price of EADS shares on the Paris Stock Exchange fell sharply after the aircraft and defense equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
After a decrease of 4%, EADS shares currently stand at EUR 21.96.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine was delayed, which obviously led to a delay in the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, which was announced in October, “will cost between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will affect Airbus”, announced the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer.
As a result of these expenditures, EADS will have to publish new plans for its 2007 operating results next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not provide further figures.
The Group also indicated that it took into account the six-month delay in preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, the operating result of EADS decreased by 86%: this was largely due to a delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which also imposed a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo remains.
Sunday’s elections are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin’s party, the United Russia.
In this, the Russian demand for stability, as it were, arbitrary governance, appears after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to voters through public service channels in a television message, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin is leading the list of candidates for the Kremlin’s support party, the Unified Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the head of state's behaviour did not reveal anything: he only made another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations,” he said.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they believe that the voters have been pressured.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zjuganov, claims that "such a dirty election in Russia was not even in Yeltsin's time".
After the defeat of last weekend's demonstrations, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorized demonstration, and his lawyer claimed that he could not continue to visit.
“The Russians are still thinking like ‘homo sovieticus’.
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of state?
The date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, was published in the official paper yesterday, and the candidates can indicate their intention to run until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There are no other offspring on the horizon.
What role does Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the president as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the parliamentary majority?
No matter what happens, the outgoing power triumphs in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
This has become a tradition.
“The Russians are still thinking like ‘homo sovieticus’: they don’t feel they can control their fate,” said Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. All the more so, because this new kind of paternalism did not involve intimidation, but certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility voluntarily", which quickly manifested itself after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all sectors of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of Unified Russia are led by 65 governors from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cserednichenko, 54, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Remarkable Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen, Hessen Province, have so far only been researched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have only provided unique and name-based access to former victims or their descendants.
The eleven states that managed the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archives to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After all the states ratified the treaty, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen archives allows historians to conduct research "on the relocation of prisoners, the inhabitants of camps and the health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
This may include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons. The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly provide evidence of their internment, which allowed them to receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent workers are currently processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
“These documents are basically nothing new,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Anti-Semitism Research at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
The turnover of indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath announced.
EU Foreign Ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission should initiate negotiations for the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Annual turnover of indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India’s number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner in the EU, according to European Commission figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can have an economic boost for both parties" and that "India could thus increase its presence in a prosperous market with 450 million inhabitants".
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange “goods worth EUR 47 billion” and “services worth EUR 10 billion” each year, said the head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi this week. At the same time, he regretted that bilateral trade “still has not reached its full potential”. The EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday in the framework of the eighth diplomatic summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England offers the financial market 10 billion pounds for a five-week term
The Bank of England would like to ease the unrest about credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it would pump EUR 10 billion into the financial market, which it will make available at a base rate of 5.75% and, unlike usual, with a maturity of five weeks.
"We want to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered on the international money market in the framework of a five-week open market operation from 6 December," the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was "ready to take further measures" to ensure that interbank loans were adapted to the central bank base rate.
The current interbank rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
And the three-month interest rate exceeded 18 September: it is currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant punitive interest on amounts pumped into the financial market, which has deterred banks from using them.
Rumor has it (which is only reinforced by the development of the pound's exchange rate compared to the euro) that many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre group refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Bureau of the Socialist Party, which included, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the restoration of variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel cheques and the restriction of rents.
Since the UMP and NC voted 180:115 against the examination of the articles, the government party and the opposition eventually interrupted their discussion, which took place only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all his group's proposals in the framework of the amendment of the corrective draft financial law, which will be on the Parliament's agenda next week.
A new festival is born
There have been a number of rumors about the new Philadelphia music festival to be held by C3 Presents. However, now the company organizing and promoting the event has announced that, in cooperation with Melvin Benn's British producer, Festival Republic, the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey.
“It’s an honor for us to work with someone who is the starter of today’s American festival movement,” said Charlie Jones of C3.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to camp.
The festival will be held between 8 and 10 August in a private 500 acres area about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
He started organizing the British Reading Festival in 1989, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn continued to expand his palette with the organisation of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic brought the Latitude Festival to life in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival's production, licensing and organizational tasks. This festival can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
C3 co-worker Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event he's ever attended." He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“We’ve chosen the location in Philadelphia before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we’ve worked hard to organize this festival in central Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We had a discussion with the city and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we have been able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival in another unique location that ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional festival organizer talent in 2002 with the Austin City Limits music festival.
The gross revenues of the two events in 2007 were 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars respectively.
Both festivals were held in urban locations.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way, creating both the European rural atmosphere and the usual urban feeling in America."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“Vineland’s population, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in such an event at a venue that hopefully will host the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "giant" in size, with a capacity of roughly 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
The ensembles have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music to make sure everyone finds what they like in it,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners Charlie Walker and Charles Attal form the C3 company, which received the "best independent event organizer" award at the last Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if they have to fight the Terminator himself...
"Seduction" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes shooting his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the Terminator Governor?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best location for it.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, that's where you'll go.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions, which will make them decide for us,” Schwarzenegger says.
Competition for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, now focuses mostly on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, be it the Sundance Film Festival, the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film L' age des tén-bres was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is also presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quebec also had four short films and four feature films represented at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts' opinions will be shared in the "subprime" crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors are already rubbing their hands and looking forward to their usual year-end hair.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "from a statistical point of view, the stock market is generally positive in December.
However, only statistical forecasts are not necessarily correct, and even in the current situation, the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term."
Experts do not support the stock exchange’s year-end growth, although they state that “the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, which gives an opportunity to invest, as there is a lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed yields, which are negatively affected by the escape to quality securities, both in the long and short term”.
As a result, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by lateral movement, which is not free of volatility, "mainly because the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is unknown for the time being, because the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tension is threatening".
Javier Barrio, the sales manager at BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means that it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "it's not a rosy situation at all."
The loss of Ibex is nearly 4 percent compared to the highest recorded values on 8 November, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts are so obnoxious.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the reorganization of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some change is expected this year, as the rally will shift to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Constitution Festival.
The analyst believes that volatility is unlikely to affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we are close to the technical level and that “we are experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may rise depending on the news from the US, as regards the consequences of the credit market crisis”.
Analysts are confident that they will be positive.
Analysts agree on which securities will be aimed at achieving the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "it's time for big securities."
He added the two major banks and a few construction companies to the list, "because by then the electric sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
For construction companies, the rally can also be positive, if at all.
“ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow along this path,” he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main player for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although there is not too much representation on the Spanish market in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have only been two December exchange rate falls.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets recovered from the crisis caused by the burst of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex corrected 35 28.17%, a 6.8% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (at the moment Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the end rally can take place.
Banco Popular Espa-ol 200 opens a 12-hour account from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Espasol has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This affects a total of 200 branches in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These accounts run under the name Popular Max and bring a big change to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group, whose branches are open continuously until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly said that it plans to extend its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to reach an agreement with the unions that he'd close 75% of his accounts in exchange for opening up one afternoon, although not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Espa-ol will be crucial for the other institutions, as this will be the basis for deciding whether to join the initiative to support a more favourable opening of shops.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Espa-ol project.
In these places, I would like to target individuals shopping, small and medium-sized enterprises, sole proprietors and local shops.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned opening hours, as it is not about a new opening schedule, but about the transformation of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening time is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
Ángel Rivera, who is responsible for commercial banks, points out that there is no need for large investments in restructuring, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Branches, which include even meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable experiences
The initiative has already been implemented in the three branches of Banco Popular Espa-ol in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The branches in the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Espasol currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialising in immigrants, and also have a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these units of PopularMax, a model of BBVA is not used, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's acting advisor, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when it turned out that the TV station he ran doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Yet one thing overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
Even so, he placed great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we "falled less".
Telecinco closed yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This increase puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
52% of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13% to Vocento, so according to Bloomberg data, its stock market value is EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has fallen 40.5 percent since January, reaching half that much, 2.193.46 million yesterday.
The other listed communications companies have a value of 3.571 million for Sogecable, 2.518.53 million for Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can accomplish in the same market, at what costs, and how this will pay off in terms of ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first TV channel in excess of $1 billion in gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publispa.
If the reported fact is met, compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent this fiscal year.
Antena 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (so it reached 734.4 million), while television’s net turnover increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors driving Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay out held so far: in 2006, he distributed 100% of the return of the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this rate may change after buying 33% of Endemol with its parent company, Mediaset.
“We are officially guaranteeing a minimum of 50% payout, although we have always distributed a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be happy with us this year, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by some slowdown.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the fact that the estimated increase in turnover will fall from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% in 2009 and from 5.5 percent to 5.1 percent in 2009.
According to the same company's forecasts, Antena 3's profits will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurity: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to its high profitability and long-term sustainable potential resulting from dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favourable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (maintenance) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, he recommends underweighting due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the takeover of MiFID, which came into force on November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with a congressional vote approving Senate amendments, the government initiated a social dialogue on the regulation on which the law was based, so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups unanimously highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable normative protection for investors and to regulate the activities of companies in detail in order to operate effectively on the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive enables financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems for the execution of orders to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchanges.
In addition, the Act requires investment service providers to provide market information on the defining aspects of their business profile, risk taking and risk management methods, and to keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of CNMV.
The Congress Economic Committee has introduced a number of amendments. Among these, it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to the high risk to the investor. This has been proven in connection with U.S. high-risk mortgage lending (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the royal decree defining professional functions that could only be carried out by economists came into force in 1977.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as an intermediary agent who works for another account, does not need the permission of CNMV, and can sell products or acquire customers to several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November, reaching 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that can be compared with data from the United States, both in terms of their origin and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs from the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore differ from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, a vice president of the government and Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1 % in November is only "temporary", but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
In the corridors of Parliament, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same within the monetary union in recent years.
He added that the month of November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged in connection with the data released today.

Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently amount to only 12 billion pounds (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since it was in crisis in mid-September and had to take out an urgent loan from the National Bank of England.
At that time, he had a record number of deposits of more than 25 billion pounds, the number of which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to customer confidence loss, despite the fact that the Government promised the bank a 100% guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will operate this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to obtain about a quarter of British banks' revenues over the next three years in order to obtain the remaining 18 billion pounds, thus reaching the $30 billion target.
Richard Branson's group of highly respected businessmen, who became known for his prominent advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend about quid 50 million a year (i.e. EUR 70 million) on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the goal set.
Northern Rock highlighted this week the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favorable to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Suspected Corruption Case
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana (Popular Party) in Murcia Province at dawn this morning because he was suspected of being involved in an urban corruption scandal this week.
Besides him, a secretary of City Hall and the chief of police of the settlement were arrested.
Former city council member José Martínez Andreo replaced the EPP representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the SER radio station, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the parliamentary presidency if the elections are won.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE in Toledo in the next parliamentary elections and to serve as President of Parliament if the Socialists won the elections.
This was announced by PSOE Organizational Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and confirmed by Bono himself at the party's federal headquarters today at noon after a meeting with Zapatero.
The head of government justified his election to the former minister by saying that "we have to deal with the best in politics", and Bono is "one of the best".
In addition, he added that "probably" the Mancha politician will be the candidate of the socialist party for Parliament's presidency if the socialists win the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run for the next elections and, giving up his political career, would then fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former minister admitted that the head of government had constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he stopped active politics two years ago.
He added that since voters are aware of who will be the economic vice president in the event of the socialist victory, the party would also like to inform them of who will be the President of Parliament in the spirit of transparency.
If Bono really does fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "the scene of respect and not insult or shouting" and more like the home of citizens.
"Unfortunately, Parliament seems to be the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly, the head of government's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Marín, his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president so that his opponents would not consider him "supervisor".
Campaign for climate
Because the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must bring to his side a political leader such as the Head of Government Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and proclaims that "we must make a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sectors are affected, and why did the Government not seek to avoid this?
It should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits of the population will have to change, what individual and social energy savings should we expect and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have not and will not be given an explanation of these questions.
It's precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures brought about by climate changes, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even the increase in PSOE's petrol price would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
In other words, we must save the Earth out of nothing, merely with propaganda texts, empty passwords free of actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even embellishes election meetings and awakens tenderness in us.

Mayor and Chief of Police of Totana Arrested for Suspected Corruption Case
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, the People's Party José Martínez Andre, the local Police Chief, the City Hall secretary and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources have informed me today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to City Hall, where he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the municipal body responsible for the management of the Urban Development Council and the Industrial Plants and Apartments.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday by the arrest of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as a built-in area to allow the Galician Nuaria company to build 4,000 homes after illegally paying commissions to managers at the time of their previous mandate.
Two others have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the information of Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now also under investigation by an independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the previous mayor, who lives in Murcia's provincial center.
The director and owner of Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A. lawyer and entrepreneur, was arrested in Nigeria (Pontevedra), together with the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. The latter company belongs to the Nuaria Group and the bribes were carried out through it.
The investigation is carried out by a group of Gendarmerie Operational Central Units responsible for crimes committed at municipal level, whose members carried out eleven searches in addition to the arrests, mainly in companies related to the arrested, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the area, who could have played a mediator in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, for which 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels would have been built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Conycase, responsible for the management of parking lots on Coruna, Venezuela Streets and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, Hogartel, specialized in direct marketing, and Preconiza, responsible for the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I'm already equipped with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can think of something for themselves.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of Finland's largest daily newspapers: (certainly at the head of the PISA report on the level of culture of the world), at Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn's book on 18 November.
"The philosophical teachings came before the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
In the messages of the killer, a student about to graduate, he quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Councillor Pekka Elo, in charge of teaching philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye, and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in compulsory basic philosophy classes in secondary schools".

One of his colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a misdemeanor related to Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a misdemeanor and is punishable from six months to one year.
However, stealing a record worth less than 400 euros in a store is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a shop, the theft is a misdemeanor, but the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty that can be imposed in the event of an Internet download (Article 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it in 40 hours, the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading it online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you participate in a mass fight, you may be punished for three months to one year (Article 154 BTK), but for copying a CD, you may be punished for six months to two years
(Article 270 BTK).
According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is more punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague is right, things have gotten out of hand.

My GP gave me an article on strange research entitled "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the workers on the payday depend on how much the others have received.
The experiment was conducted at Bonn University by measuring magnetic resonances by tomograph, and the results were published in the last issue of Science.
The study’s author and head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but the partner made a mistake.”
The researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double amounts, activity increased.
I have no idea why so much science was needed for such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague and investigating crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste in her mouth, as those responsible for the massacre in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Bosnian leader Radovan Karajich are still at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). Like a real crime scene, the film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to need the loop around the fugitive sinners.
What insurance is right for me?
Vehicle insurance, which means safety for the owner of the car against various damage events, is significant and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining the driver's license, marital status, type and nature of the car to be insured.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes to compensate for the fixed insurance premium in the event of the event of the damage.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and others.
Insurance companies determine the premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by those who represent a higher risk of accidents.
That’s why women over the age of 25 or pay less, as statistics show that they pose a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, frequency is decisive.
More frequent use increases the possibility of an accident.
When determining the insurance premium, insurance companies take into account a number of factors.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into it so that he can choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors in choosing to best adapt to the needs of the insured and to set an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have to face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of their driving licence.
Although it is ideal to be assured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
Precautionary drivers can take out complete insurance with themselves, thus ensuring against all dangers, and the price will be affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of the self-insurance to be paid by the insured depends on the premium; the higher the premium, the lower the self-insurance,” says Luis Noguera, head of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended liability insurance for third parties when the customer provides himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus and you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
Bonuses are called discounts compared to the basic tariff of the insurance company.
Compared to the basic tariff, the penalty is called malus.
“The amount of the bonus and the ralus depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, you can afford to increase the bonus,” explains Noguera.
Once the age of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to get adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced thanks to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to take full insurance with you.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experience properly in an accident or even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married, but they do not have children yet, it is best to take out complete insurance, of course, if his financial opportunities allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so the fee to be paid is also lower in their case.
In this case, it is best to own a complete insurance (this can reach up to EUR 300) or, if they have a higher bonus, extend the insurance to the damage caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share," Luis Noguera said.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend full insurance (around 150 euros) or in the case of a higher bonus it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it provides protection to the owner in the event of damage events, but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the personalized form of insurance properly.
Celtic wants to score a point in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will match their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point at the closing of the Champions League. The Italians will be the first to qualify and the Scots will be the first to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round they have ensured the passage with a draw with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but one more point is needed so that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, does not beat it.
Group D's two matches will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milán will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championships, where he will try to make it to the 16th final in the semifinal on the 13th.
With this, Group D will be closed sooner than the others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the draw, the two teams will strive to win, as the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the eighth final.
Even losing to Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure of that, because if there's a point equal, the Ukrainians will go on, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next fight (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scots miserable, who want to get into the eighth final of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after the previous season they lost a goal from the Rooster in the extension after the 0-0 draw (1-0).
The victory of the "Rossonerik" could be best enjoyed by Shakhtar, because if Celtic loses, they'll be in the eighth final and stay in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite the fact that it is currently in the last place and without a chance to stay in the European Championship, can still win the third place with a victory to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver, Canada, for the first time in front of 20,000 viewers since they disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced a few minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was "in great form".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, where a video film was presented about the history of the band in the 1990s.
At the same time as the band was reassembled and the tour, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring the larger hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took the stage in a bracelet from the husband of "Posh Spice", British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although Victoria forbade him a few days earlier.
When the performance was announced, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "did not see our performance dress, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think about the performance".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason the band disbanded two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members did not understand each other". He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
Now I'm glad I made this decision," Chisholm said about the band, which was disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also added that over time "things have settled and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on Virgin Airlines' special plane.
At the airport, a group of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th)
They will perform in Madrid on December 23rd.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
The gas dispute between Ukraine and Russia has resumed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations are always closely monitored.
Kiev said that if Moscow raises the price of gas to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also hit Russia with higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries have decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow relates to the attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom to negotiate an agreement on the price of gas to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to implement a 50% increase in gas extracted from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement concluded with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the shipment from Gazprom for Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in line with one of the most important transit states for natural gas during the negotiations," Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should certainly be linked to our debate on the extent of the costs of transits through Ukraine (and to Western Europe).
As a result of the recent major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas tap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s gas supply.
Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS “must monitor foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS Committees must improve checks on the criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal was made by Chief Accountant Robert Black after a foreign national doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of overseas employees.
At the same time, in his report, he pointed out, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that have been properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the chief auditor checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors questioned by the Old Bailey Court in October on charges of car bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees shall verify the existence of qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and the availability of permits to work in the United Kingdom for their employees from overseas countries before starting employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the territory of Great Britain.
Among other things, the chief auditor's report proposed that the committees should introduce the Criminal Records Office's guidance, which facilitates the audit process with different overseas countries for the employer.
"Although evidence of such checks has been found in the records of the staff, they are not carried out regularly," the report says.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening procedure at a high level, adding: "Our report highlights the areas of the system that can be developed in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS overseas staff."
According to Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, it is “extremely unrealistic” to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently in place in NHS Scotland are working well, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas employees, consisting of doctors and nurses, currently account for 1,161 people.
However, the chief auditor pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which can be partly explained by the fact that the Commissions have a problem identifying employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian operate in a highly coordinated manner.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and evidence of professional qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on pre-employment controls for NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was very pleased that this task was carried out after the attack on Glasgow airport.
He further added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the up-to-date guidance on pre-employment checks on the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division at the Film Awards
The biopic "Control", made of Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, also received an award, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was played, as well as director Anton Corbijn and side character Toby Kebbell.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the thriller "Details of a Scandal".
And the Variety Prize was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for the international spotlight of the British film.
The awards were awarded in the framework of the ceremony held in Roundhouse, London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis' rise within the Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The production of the black and white film "The Killers", David Bowie and the black and white film "New Order on the soundtrack" cost only quid 3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously become known for making the album cover of U2 "Joshua Tree", was still awarded two awards; the award of the best director and the best beginner director.
Another award winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, singer of Clash, won the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of David Cronenberg's London thriller, the mob boss of "Killy Promises."
Ray Winstone, famous for his hard-core roles, received the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes, among other things, the films "Scum", "Éhkoppon" and "Sexy Dog", is currently involved in the production of the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after Harris, the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" who died in 2002.
“For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors,” Winstone said.
“I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time, and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 people arrested in Saudi Arabia in connection with terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were arrested, planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility and several strikes on churchmen and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to the television report, an eight-person cell led by a foreign resident was planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After an attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, organized by Al-Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began building a rapid response force of 35,000 to protect the facilities.
According to a report citing the Minister of the Interior, 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile shooter" who illegally crosses the border.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight bullets into the territory of the kingdom.
22 of the arrested were planning to commit attacks on church leaders and security forces.
The government has called on church leaders to take tougher action to curb Saudis who are joining Al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government. The latter is considered heretic by Saudi hardline Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda fighters regard a significant part of the Saudi Arabian church leaders as involved by the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family governing the government.
Encouraging Al-Qaeda’s Saudi-born leader, Osama bin Laden, to target the pro-Western Saudi government, the group’s fighters set out to attack settlements, government buildings and energy facilities with foreign residents.
“The security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past... five months,” an Interior Ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also caught in Medina, aimed at spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims branded unfaithful and apostate.
The arrests included 32 people accused of financial support for the militants.
The climate of Venus can provide an outlook on the future of the Earth
Scientists found yesterday that Venus could once provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggests that this planet is much more of an Earth's capricious twin brother than we thought.
Venus is the closest planet next door to Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago Venus could have been ruled by living conditions very similar to that of the Earth, and even habitable conditions could have been given.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the lower rotation speed of the planet, Venus has entered a completely different developmental path.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is destroyed by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year's study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can occur on Earth.
Fred Taylor, a professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is beginning to show why the climate of Venus differs so greatly from that of Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar in structure.
“With the help of our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it could have had living conditions similar to Earth.
"Enriched Uranium" seized by police
A kilo of radioactive material - enriched uranium, according to reports - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokeswoman did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Widely open gates
Mitt Romney says he's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Yet the Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions submitted on Wednesday evening, November 28, proved to be as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate broadcasted by the other party on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers on this occasion reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year's election.
It is not yet known on what basis the production leaders of CNN, who co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube clips submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half hour of the debate dealt with immigration.
That's one of the Republicans' commas.
CNN asked some insecure voters to dial a number if it was a graceful thing for them: the mediator experienced outstanding agreement when the candidates spoke hard on the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani, who was leading at national level, and Romney, who advanced in decisive pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture of her being too light on the issue of illegal immigration during her mayorship in New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house by the former Massachusetts governor.
The battle between the two became particularly intense when the questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would ensure illegal immigrants permanent status and citizenship).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as representatives Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, have managed to get deep into the subject.
And although none of them are likely to be nominated, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they began to ring the bell of immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take tough action against illegal immigrants.
This theme, like the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani faced the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner asked whether the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this matter, Giuliani stumbled and finally held on to the view that, although he considered the Bible to be his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the election in Iowa, who was responsible for his victory thanks to his persistent Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it was necessary.
When asked if Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for office.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's dynamic rise in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fundraising operation and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at the debate on Wednesday.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the aspirants representing more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who shouted the victory message of America's greatness in time and convincingly, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
However, the party is now divided, and the consequences are unforeseeable for the time being.
Labour Party Pains
There is another gap in front of Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged
Compared to the British political scandals, the current one does not seem too spicy.
No one sold their honor, no politician found their Paris hotel bills, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
However, the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the names of others, for more than four years, contributed a sum of more than 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million) to the Labour Party, which ruled Britain, and that the party did not report on this, is one of the things without which the surrounded Gordon Brown would have been well.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when, with his statement that public opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision, he recklessly questioned the British's intellectual ability, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, noted with ever more witty remarks, turned from once feared Brown Stalin into Mr. Bean.
The failure to save a stuck bank called Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and judgment gaps in the crossfire.
Sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to join forces with the government.
The loss of 25 million people’s personal data by the tax authority has revealed an unimaginably high level of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals instigated mutiny, protesting against the reduction of the army's budget, stating that the position of Minister of Defence is a part-time occupation.
And now here are the mysterious donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (formerly administrative leader), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which control becomes impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is unlikely to be able to move things forward, and perhaps not to remain in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil servants are starting to leak out, the cabinet ministers are going to brief, the press is looking for bad news; and the government is starting to defend itself and will be unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as he'd like to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and tax records, for example, are linked to decisions made during Brown's Finance Ministry.
And although Blair did not participate directly in the missteps, such as the protracted investigation of the relationship between the "nobility for money" case and political party financing, voters can rightly assume the opposite.
Although Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
The blunders committed aren't as scary as the toriks indicate.
As in Mr. Bean's case, no one died, no one was picked up directly.
And compensation, no matter how painful, can always be the creation of the trends promised by Stalin in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed governance.
For example, there is a fuss about political donation.
The garboian mysterious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to present his good deed to the public.
Perhaps that is the case, but it was not his responsibility to make the decision.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clearly justified: the population has the right to know who knocks at the gate of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, knew Abrahams' action, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations; just like Jon Medleson, head of the Labour Party's foundation, who was informed of the confusing donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, has no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these twists, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, half of the Prime Minister's task has been fulfilled.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, his strength was diluted by the fact that he touched a familiar instrument; he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, just in case.
In this story, the "learning lesson" is not very complicated.
In the event of a breach of law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown has to fix other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee on administrative rules, which has been without a leader for six months, or the promotion of effective reform of political party financing.
This would require the hard hat Labour Party to cooperate with the Toris and break up with special financial relations related to the associations - this would be a tough wall for party loyal Brown.
But you're going to have to face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win back voters behind him; the only way to achieve victory is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card sharks
Is the Second Market Mortgage Market Crisis Threatening America’s Credit Card Market?
If there is blood in the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is indisposed, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail loans, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-down rate showing the rate of unrecoverable loans and the default rate indicating the rate of late payments over 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion in the US consumer finance segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
At the same time, panic is premature.
The rate of write-offs and late payments remains low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by the Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decline in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency applicants, but at the same time caused a large loss in the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the total terms of borrowing deteriorate or not.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit repayment for consumers, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market are clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the movement of money and not the value of assets, so the fall in housing prices does not necessarily cause a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may also benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage, the incentive for consumers to repay the credit will be reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will move forward in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of a sudden re-price of assets.
“It’s unlikely that one day we’ll wake up to fully reevaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is much greater.
If declining housing prices and a decline in lending put America in a recession, the industry is no doubt facing a grim future.
It's worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers plead guilty to Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were tried to investigate their role in the fraud of Enron's former financial director, Andrew Faston, confessed to his guilt.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent of seven counts of fraud, which alleged to have cooperated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing before the U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of single-order fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into the case launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers named "NatWest Three" were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud together with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was then the right hand of Fastow.
Fastow, responsible for planning countless frauds that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men well knew that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's share of $1 million in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would buy the $20 million subsidiary share from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million hit the hands of British bankers Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers got $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his two counts of guilt for his role in Enron's collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a prison in Texas.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States for a bail of $1 million each during the trial.
Enron, the seventh largest American company ever, declared bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer cover up the millions accumulated as debt or the profitable but actually loss-making businesses.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs were lost, market value fell by more than $60 billion and pension funds by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, was convicted last year for their complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine that takes the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
However, this amount is only small for some Russian rich people.
“It has 18 passengers in it,” said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one orders so many seats because the machines are purchased for private families or corporate managers."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Millionaires Fair, which was held in the huge exhibition hall around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented a stand at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new rich are interested in everything, from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-coated grilles worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not worth our products," he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did in his prime, during the oil price explosion.
“We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered materialistic here,” said Marshall Goldman, senior scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like Saudi Arabian gamblers in the 1970s and Japanese gamblers in the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organized by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people, there are 53 billionaires in Russia who have a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who have a total of 670 billion dollars, according to a study by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed personal welfare development in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, the number of people living below the living standard in Russia was 15.8 percent in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London’s David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are impeccablely cared for, and men are a treasure trove.”
On Sunday evening, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were attributed to both themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I was trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said young Yumatova, who was in a brazen rush in his custom-designed clothes, as if he was used to this fuss.
The fair was held primarily for the new rich, brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around a drafty, fancy decorated venue after several hours in traffic, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund plush bears at the same time.
For ordinary people, the ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who had a patriotic look at the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, as opposed to a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue tile painted Rembrandt imitation.
“The Russians are more interested in things that are striking.”
Indeed, the sellers here said that for a long time (according to Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) rich Russians have already switched from flagrant logos to bagatell, limited editions of brands that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, filled the place every day.
Some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil's bedmaking company, said that on that day he sold two mattresses, each worth $70,000, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with a golden thread.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of A1 Moto, who is engaged in supplying high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170 thousand.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that provides a solution to individual needs, sold three grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms by Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said was coated with Swarovski crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a set of four pieces: $22,000.
“A Russian millionaire who wants to have wheels made of ostrich leather and a picture of his wife’s face made of a zirconium cube will not necessarily use these objects,” Karapetian said.
"He'll keep them in his garage, guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid increase in real estate prices there.
“If you bought real estate in Moscow four or five years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, if not in cash, or at least on paper,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least give the impression of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were piled up with millions of fake dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many of them took pictures of themselves using a mobile phone as they lay in the throng of money or just put a few million in their pockets.
“You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev said.
Surgical malpractice suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked at the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just a Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly thereafter, a police patrol car arrived.
And then another one.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” said Mr. Livingston, an inspector working at the restaurant.
"Then I knew someone was dead."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo. She used to work as the chief assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
The investigation is currently under way to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon working under 212 West Scott Avenue, unidentified by the police.
Authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests that will be available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to high-ranking employees of the Newark police.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
“He was loyal, diligent and reliable,” McCarthy said in an interview with Arroyo on Wednesday.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, who was a former Newark police officer, currently working on the Gas Industry Products Control Committee, and left behind two boys, 14 and 11 years old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the investigators were working to determine whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's intervention.
"The probability is high," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November
On the 21st, and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
More than a week has passed, and the police have so far revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro had been heard by the detectives.
The study participants will investigate whether part of the house has functioned as a doctor’s office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a wilted rose bush stood in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the basement, in the car entrance there was a blue tank marked "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
From hookers, two mountain bikes hung sideways.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years at the New York police station, Mrs. Arroyo was an invaluable help by helping her navigate the unusual and uncut political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'This and that will be better for you to be careful,'" he remembered.
“He was always here when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations for the Fed to cut interest rates lead to a storm in the world’s stock markets
Stock prices rose on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the reassuring statements by the Deputy President of the US Central Bank increased the hope that the Fed will try to ease investment opportunities with further interest cuts.
Stock markets were booming in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of Fed President Ben Bernanke, declared that leaders should respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing unrest in the financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal to calm the markets amid the signs of a revitalizing credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest “partly pushed back the development on the market at the end of September and October”.
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as saying that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest rate reductions in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements also calmed Wall Street, which has recently been exposed to a number of bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of U.S. housing sales.
The side effect of the financial unrest was confirmed by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that, in order to compensate for the loss in the U.S. second-market home loan sector, as part of the cost reduction, it will lay off 650 employees and 4% of its global workforce.
A total of 20 jobs in London with 1,500 employees are affected by this measure.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55% and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The credit market unrest was renewed after the high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank brought three-month-long papers to European banks at a price of 4.7 percent, which has not been seen since April 2001.
After a steady increase in the British interbank interest rate, Libor, after November 12, reached its highest level since September, 6.59%, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to release additional capital to the London financial market.
UK demands decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the English team's number six jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, who makes the decision is no less important?
The latter question is relevant, on the one hand, because David Graveney, president of the selectors, who temporarily fulfills this particular task, assists the lead coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the account of the English Managing Director Hugh Morris' desk is starting to fill with requests to reach a national, or at least a one-time selection post.
Of the two players, the shorter one draws, which does not get the sixth place, but as is known, life, and especially sport, is often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes a person reach the top of his or her vocation, while no one else can get past even a lower level. Often it depends more on luck than on talent.
It is not only cricket that it is difficult to choose, often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, such as, say, John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications who know business well, while there is room for only one of them.
Who can tell to which level a cricket player is fit without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data greatly influence the decision, but the options are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain's glance at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batting player has to get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
For example, more people have played better than James Anderson in the last season, yet he is a sure team member in the first test, despite Stephen Harmison's own statement that he is in good shape and is doing very well.
Anderson fought 32 first-class gates down and 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only struck 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope that they will continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can blow up or break anyone's career, but it may not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet it was Paul Collingwood, who rose up at the time and became a decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated even today, despite the fact that he scored a double hundred points against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will vote for Shah's greater experience against Bopara's young vitality and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is in favour of his bright and successful debut in the districts of the 88 Bombay test. In contrast to the 22-year-old Bopara, who is seven years younger than him, who also achieved 32 first-class hundreds in excellent twisted throws.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah ran only ten in two quarters at home in May, in the Lorda test against West Indies, and that Vaughan, who fought for him for his re-enactment in the next game, met the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have reduced the perseverance that was still clearly visible in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's universal talent is a cheerful and unsurpassed player.
There's nothing to upset him about on the cricket track, but he described his off-track behavior well when he overturned at an exhibition with a four-wheeler from the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
Nevertheless, the very first thing he did after that was take over Vodafone's (of course sponsored) phone and call his remote-watching teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better trackside player with classics. He creates an advantage for his slipped medium steps, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I would give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would be outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing this weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by bus to work and fight Al Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired their visas, or even those who hope that order will be restored in the city.
There are also those who have returned to fight the soldiers who chased them out of their houses.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled dozens of buses arrived.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sunni Dr Sabah al-Qubaisi.
“I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is safe now.
“They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he added, referring to the militia minister Moqtada al-Sadr, who has currently stopped his Shiite army.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from Amariyah, predominantly inhabited by Sunni, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking up work.
Amarijai's Shita neighbors called him and urged him to return home, saying with the help of American-backed troops, he managed to push Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, North Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had created an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed the support of me and my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke about the fact that since the entry of American troops in the capital, peace has been strengthened and that armed civilian forces working with Americans have lured them home.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, with three children, voiced the widespread view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject refugees' visa applications to force them to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people escaped from the death squads operating in the country.
“Everything was fine until Al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and pressured the government not to issue any more visas to Iraqis in order for them to move home,” the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled.”
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the Sunnis were expelled from the Shita areas, while the Shitas also left Sunni areas, resulting in a reduction in tension in many regions.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will upset the moods again, which may lead to new battles.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal province is a leader in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one training area do Saarlanders struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
“For the fiftieth time yesterday, I explained to someone outside the Saarland that we are not French,” a self-ironic slogan on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which, according to surveys by the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, can boast of the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even because of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is high by 15.6 percent.
However, even those who want to study in the Saar region have an above-average attraction to colleges and universities in the Saar region - many of them do not have high school degrees.
“In the Saar region, professional training opportunities are being exploited,” explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than a fifth of young people gain further education in vocational schools, making the Saar region more than seven percent above the federal average.
The combination opportunities of professional and higher education are also well-designed.
The infrastructure for double studies is second in terms of population in Germany.
Despite practice-oriented training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education in Saarland obliged higher education institutions to conduct marketing campaigns focusing on engineering.
“In primary schools, we have initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for children to start studying earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that the other federal provinces have started copying in the meantime.
Whether the performance of the students will be permanently improved will only be answered by future comparative studies.
According to the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of students affected by the risk decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saar region has not improved as much as that of the other federal provinces.
The Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language knowledge is not taken into account in the Pisa survey - otherwise they could otherwise reap laurels in this area,
The language of the neighboring countries in high schools is a mandatory subject - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chavez changes the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are different in the near future than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timers back in the Latin American country by half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, according to a new law, clocks are turned back four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-U.S. Chávez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States forced the whole clock-based time zones into the world.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chavez said, calling for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country will have to express their views on Sunday in a referendum.
The reform would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels about the release of hostages.
With his decision, Uribe "spit in the face" Venezuela, voiced his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, there was a new mobile ringing: "Por qué no te callas" - this is what more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet for themselves.
The sentence comes from Charles John, king of Spain, who was so upset at the last Latin America summit by the constant shouts of the populist politician in Ballolda that he put it in his voice.
In 2007, German workers were at risk of falling wages.
A real wage decline is forecast to threaten German workers this year despite strong economic activity.
Experts supported their pessimistic predictions for a bouquet of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually expect less pay in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage development, an increase in VAT and a rapid increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research told Bild.
Employees may also be burdened with unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the daily newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the current situation is a right and reasonable reduction in unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be placed in such a difficult situation to apply to the alliance for credit or support, the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD, was quoted.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
Annually, prices increased by a total of 3%.
Venus is the Earth's diabolical twin
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than previously assumed: In its atmosphere, the European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightning and on its polar circles wind vortexes such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightning.
The European space probe "Venus Express" provided evidence - discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles, in the columns of the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "old soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightnings: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington, D.C.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin brother, but it's still her twin brother," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different path of development.
The launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 1990s, no probe has been on the road specifically to find this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles prove not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, researchers have discovered an even faster-moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, according to the research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmoca Institute.
The second innermost planet in the solar system is almost the same mass as Earth's, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost the size of Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Evening Star, orbits the sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own tenge: a Venus day lasts 243 days on earth.
Although Venus’ surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with 92 bar pressure, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were formed under completely similar conditions.
They both had water on them, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while Venus went to the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus it forms a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Köhler, President of the German Republic, demands the end of the debate between the parties that erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the reception in September.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the debate around the Dalai Lama's reception.
"We should not be seen as a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
“Human rights are universally valid for me, even if I respect the differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of a delicate balance in foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, he defended Merkel against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional ‘one China’ policy.
China is aware of this,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of the Dalai Lama's reception and therefore became the target of attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "exposition policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office, there were intense disturbances in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only withdrew the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to accept the Tibetan religious leader as European politicians in their official capacity, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that it is trying to separate other Tibetan territories including Tibet and other present-day provinces from China.
Schauble warns against riots similar to those in France
Street clashes with the police, gunshots, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schauble protects against riots like those in France.
All efforts must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not end in street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior demands.
Barricades were on fire, randalists shot the police with shotguns: After the serious riots of young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) feared similar developments in Germany.
“We must make sure that the social explosives do not accumulate in our country and do not result in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the newspaper "Neue Presse" in Hannover.
Not all young people are adapted to the rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, Sch.uble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes have already been made.”
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schauble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in German suburbs such as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, on recent nights, young people have been fighting serious street fights with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Communities in Germany, demanded more activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
Yet action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is “higher than average”.
First of all, more education should be provided.
Kolat said: “We need to provide a perspective for young people.”
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "family social surveillance" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "However, we must be on guard."
“The faster young people must be given the opportunity to have a job and receive education.”
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete calm during the night.
Hundreds of police were ready to deploy, scanning the area with a helicopter headlight.
The competent authorities reported three arrests and some flaming garbage cans and cars.
Since the reporting, a security unit of around 1000 people has been providing peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after her visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were wounded as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots broke out in connection with a traffic accident in which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the State Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
Cloudwalker in Angela's empire
The Chancellor's action, which is out of reality, is a testimony that the coalition is at its end - and nothing can be expected of him.
Which country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
Following the bleak and indifferent and meaningless action taken at the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be stated that he does not live here - he does not live in the country whose governance would be his responsibility.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation with a very superior sentence that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches were.
Meanwhile, there was no particular interest or empathy for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela Cloudwalker came up: a politician who ran away from reality and fled to foreign policy, and there was only uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: He praises himself unrestrainedly for the Heiligendamm Decisions, but he is silent about how to achieve the climate targets in the country.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned - such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years earlier.
Now he's clinging to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
By doing so, he harms his reputation as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of wordflowers.
However, in Angela's cloud-walking empire, domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and low income problems?
He praises this only on a few half-phrases.
From this point of view, it is telling how often he stumbles when it comes to family allowances.
It takes Merkel three times to come up with a half-sound sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he wanders in foreign territory.
Storm Division
During the debate of Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard change of punch - and now they should be afraid of an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already surfaced in connection with the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he has made New York "a refuge for illegal immigrants".
"I would say that his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants," Giuliani says, and throws it against the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he employed undocumented immigrants as private people.
The candidates are on the move: Since the Republican camp still does not have a unitedly supported favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to undermine the credibility of their opponent.
The 30-second videos sent by Internet users via Youtube are little more than short summaries.
"We have brought Hitler to power with this kind of isolationism," rumbles John McCain under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who, as the only participant in the circle, demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by a veteran who has been to Vietnam when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, the interrogation method in which drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that important topics of the campaign are only beyond Iraq and the debates on torture is shown by the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
There is a loud applause in the room for the praise of conservative values and the rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more apparent.
"I was wrong at the time," says Romney repentantly and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for voting for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, trembles when he is asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs for the first time as a civilian
One day after his withdrawal from the army, Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, was sworn in as President.
This puts an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a further five-year term of office on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf swore an oath to the Constitution and to act for the benefit of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus, above all, gave in to international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after the former general broke into power without bloodshed in the form of a military coup, he now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf's withdrawal as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the abolition of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the state of emergency shortly after his oath, which will meet another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, in which Musharraf installed lawyers sympathetic to him at the beginning of November after the declaration of the state of emergency, rejected any protests last week about the disputed re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in the tribal area in the north, North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured as a result of an assassination of a military convoy.
According to the military spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are Back
The German super team of the 1970s plays again: The three band members of Harmonia dusted their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reassembly, a cut recording appears from their prime, the time of "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation is in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
In front of each of them is his own instrument, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63 years old, sits in a white shirt in the middle.
From the left, Michael Rother, 57 years old, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
Looking from the audience to the right, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius rolled and focused on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, while at the same time rhythm.
And sometimes it's like it's accidentally made into traditional music.
However, all this does not seem to disturb the lords themselves.
It was a great thrill for the lovers of Krautrock music that Harmonia band played again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has passed through the collective pop memory, but in no case has it left any lasting clues that we painfully miss this band after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their seventies?
In particular, what we misleadingly call Krautrock has always been appreciated in England and America more than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for oeuvre to the still living members of the Cologne Can band in 2003, the figures of German pop sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When he thanked even La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation of Red Hot Chili Peppers, the wonder became limitless.
At the concerts, he then sat on stage as Michael Rother's old pal with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overloaded by Harmonia only because the trio existed only for two years, and during that time it had a far less effect than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, to a record company funded by the church.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time he gained a reputation as the guitarist of perhaps the most radical German band at the time, Neu!
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into their exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, a 16th - century city in Rom, he fled as a commune.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic art.
It is said that the flag of Harmonia Ottenstein came out of the garbage and was thus named their art.
Some of these things were recorded in Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered financial need.
The collection of roses alone did not ensure finding themselves.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record audience of less than 50 people, so someone remembers.
Forced Harmonia and occasional practice at the time was Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up with esoterics and maintained himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album in Griessemi is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, Greenland, set the goal of taking care of krautrock as a special German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug up in the same way as Roedelius' solo work.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, author of the British Ancient Punk and Krautrock Sampler, is also present.
Also present is Loveparade's brainstormer, Dr. Motte.
This roughly outlines the impact of krautrock on the next pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement floats with the most unusual sounds in the room: "The only true music, the future."
There are pictures depicting the producer with Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The screening of additional black and white photos of tangled cabling equipment serves to build legends.
In the foreground, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of lureing out sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments with the help of devices producing their own escabbled sound effects.
Today, electric music seems like electric music.
Three tech-deep craftsmen.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's command, they chuckle and whisper, and in a beautiful part, they sing "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68!", he's not on the wrong track, and Harmonia still won't let him get out of his way.
Even the most obvious thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can drive you nervously mad, or offer you the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films once again deal with the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help that in "Hunting."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, as many of his good-boy-nothing roles in emotional films for women and many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have even discouraged us from looking at him.
And here, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most powerful argument for maybe watching the movie "Hunting."
It provides a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the Simon Hunt war correspondent he formed is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious to him: A man who had long left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline as a ruined monument preserved a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the film "Hunting" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" started screening this week, despite this ad, only continues an endless series of fallen films about the Balkan war.
We don't have to waste much time on the film "Mörderischer Frieden": The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian woman from the snipers in Kosovo, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her as an encore.
Although it is to be welcomed that for once the Serbs are not depicted as the sole cause of all evil, the film carrying the shallowness of TV films is too quickly lost in the shooting and eventful scenes.
It carries a "Cobra 11" character - instead of a highway with war.
On the other hand, in the case of the "Hunting", it is possible to examine, as an example, why no really good film has actually been made about the Balkan war.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who came up with the name "Róka" could have become a new "Apocalypse now" at a different age with another director and other screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal union).
After all, the stories show a surprising resemblance: In both cases, small groups set out in the forest to do what the army is unable to do - and in both cases, the journey to madness takes place.
One of the reasons for the fall of the "Hunting" is that he simply does not let Simon Hunt be the depraved cynic who listens to his heart as he presents him at the beginning.
No, and in the script, he even spends a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
The "Hunting" slips for good when reporters reach what Nato, the CIA, and all the world's bounty hunters couldn't do in five years in the form of an accelerated recording in the last five minutes of the film: They capture the war criminal and then hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to turn to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for a crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to make it clear that Karajich and Mladic are still at large and accuse the Americans and the French (in which they are said to be exceptionally united) of not continuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political deals.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this, the poet writes about the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare at the dilapidated blood vessel on his temple with a share, which tells us how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies like "Hunting" have the same oversized, man-head-shaped masks, which, however, show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were an ugly failure.
We can add: There have not been any good films about South Africa yet.
Almost always valid: If a star wanders around the world's crisis or minefields, it turns out to be like "The Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust with the film Schindler's List.
Probably some films are still worth it - because the films about the Vietnam War, which are now classics, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", were not celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But it is possible that these days, when all mass killings come into our homes in real time through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this deprives screenwriters of the ignorance of reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The dictator" did so well because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
You may not want to make a good movie if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps the novelist Lawrence Norfolk needs to be sarcastically distant from his artistic perspective.
When he was questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprisre-lexicon" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It only depends on the fact that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust has been criticized for cancelling the Olympics.
The mayor's demarcation from Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympic Games provoked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of water games.
Von Beust, however, strongly warns of realities during the opportunity.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the retreat "unfavorable for the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently liberated such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
“Without this goal, we would not be able to maintain evenly the momentum of sport policy.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "based on modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides the Olympic bid, it's the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Association at the beginning of December on the tender submitted for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Munich.
"To give this priority to us means that we will not have a realistic chance within the period until 2028 that we have so far thought of."
However, we will not give up the dream for good, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to waste an opportunity to bury our plans now,” HSB President Günter Ploc said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement by the President of the Senate at the general meeting of the General German College Sports Association.
There, Von Beust was described by the application submitted to the city of Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade as not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association has only launched Hamburg as a participating city in the competition last week.
The SPD's civilian faction accused the Senate of leaving valuable time unused in terms of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted in favour of the Olympics and ignored housing," said two SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has constantly broken a spear for Kleiner Grasbrook in favour of an integrated plan for Olympic and later housing use, the CDU has unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was very enthusiastic in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden crates to each other is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates produced in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box listed in this is fake.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, now the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has come to a sobering conclusion: The six copies of "Brillo Box" donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén, former museum director in 1995 - and most likely a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Box on the international art market.
The history is a confusing chain of long and complicated artistic and board stunts.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxai" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the soap powder "Brillo".
At an exhibition of his works held in Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, hundreds of cardboard Brillo crates were exhibited: these (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't about works of art, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not issued in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the time now speak of about fifteen crates that, as authenticated Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box, were entitled to enter the history of art and auction under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden crates were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hulten's 105 crates were only manufactured in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg in Malmo.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the main monument administrator of Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish privately owned boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first laid down and sanded, and the white oil paint was then brushed up.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 shows that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without foundation - and it is not oil, it is acrylic paint.
"These crates were not certified by the artist, so they should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it would investigate the "serious accusations" raised in connection with soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been wrapped in unrelenting silence.
Insurgent soldiers in Manila give up
Soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave up the rebellion in the Philippines.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, their hotel manager Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters.
Before that, government soldiers using tear gas stormed the hotel.
The two dozen soldiers barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team were in court on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly break the wheel with 30 sympathizers.
The military police tasked with guarding the man obviously switched to him and joined the mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyal units have sealed off the high-end hotel area.
The president called the security cabinet for an emergency meeting.
Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' proceedings.
“People are tired,” Trillanes said.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the Scout Rangers elite, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march in a short time.
On Friday, critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for several months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of the rebellion attempt against Arroyo organized by around 200 members of the army in 2003.
After less than 24 hours, the uprising failed when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, at least seven coup attempts have taken place in the Philippines against democratically elected governments.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of its stake in Versatel telecommunications.
As the company said on Wednesday, the average price per share is 14.46 Euros.
This represents 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing ownership in Versailles remains open.
With this step, they want to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Prior to this, on Wednesday, there were assumptions about a possible involvement, after Berenberg Bank increased its share of the network service provider in Düsseldorf by an additional 5 percent to 15.1%.
The financial institution only maintains the share to a third party, it is reported in the financial market.
On the previous day, United Internet already owned a narrow 10% of the Drillisch mobile phone company.
Within the framework of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” a United-Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies jointly founded the MSP joint venture to take over the competing Freenet.
In the beginning, the two companies are satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and do not exercise the right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies remain open to all possibilities, especially with regard to increasing the shareholding in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet, which has been held for months and is only a matter-of-fact game, is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed access customers.
United Internet and the holding company Drillisch have so far held a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring in another four percent.
The right to purchase 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
