Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear they will find themselves on the Muppet Show.
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked at the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after the name of the National Assembly (Assembly) should be the Welsh Parliament.
Now Members from different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title could make them a laughing stock.
According to one Labour representative, his faction is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple, and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the whole faction is "unsatisfied" and therefore alternatives are proposed.
One conservative representative said that his faction was "open" to change the name, but noted that the MWP was only a jump from the "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as "u" in Yorkshire English, i.e. MWP pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the change of name is as follows: "The final decision on the titles for the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The 2017 law governing Wales made it possible for the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation which proposed the name of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the title of Members, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member title and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
MEPs are coming up with more and more alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and Commission structures.
Members will be able to vote their final vote on the issue of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia holds a referendum on changing the name of the country
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to decades of debate with neighbouring Greece, one of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that its northern neighbour's name is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly objected to its request for EU and NATO admission.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the change of name and thus does not take part in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise to be concluded for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The churches of Harlem in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin also silenced
“A long time ago, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“People have different ways of socializing these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the communal living rooms where people go every day.”
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will return to the same place from which they began.”
And the churches will be replaced, he adds, by residential buildings whose residential community will also not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, he claims, and this will further hasten the final closure of the churches, as it is unlikely that most of those who move into these apartments will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the church in the thirties.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the reverend is known for leading boycotts against the shop owners of the Harlem shopping street, 125th Street for the use of blacks or black products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation, the bell was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
According to the expert who played the bell game in July, this bell game is "a cultural heritage", "an irreplaceable, historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell in the world to be performed by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who joined the larger bell game of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin didn't hire anyone to replace him.
In St. Martin, a complex situation has unfolded in recent months with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved partly in the secular leadership of the church and partly in the episcopal office.
In July, the governing body of the parish, the parish council, turned to the episcopal office in writing, objecting that the office would “transfer the costs” to the council, even though the council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain of a lack of transparency around the office's house.
Shark Attacks 13-Year-Old Californian Boy While Fishing for Crabs
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during crab fishing on the opening day of the crab season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego told me that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends about half an hour ago when he noticed a boy crying out for help.
Hammel first thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a cancer, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "He bit me!
He bit me!"
“His shoulder was torn at his clavicle,” Hammel said, “what he saw when he got to the boy.”
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water’,” he added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
Rescue Commissioner Larry Giles told the press that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then found to be not a species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours during the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury’s expands to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert sellers and large store-style piperestands with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its growing growth in the British beauty market of 2.8 billion pounds in the midst of the decline in sales of fashion and household goods, the chain will test larger piperestands in 11 stores across the country, and in the event of success, they will appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the pipe line is due to the fact that stores try to fill the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwave ovens and household items in different ways.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But previous brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in larger areas on brand stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also restarts the Boutique make-up family, in which most of the products are now vegan, as more and more young customers are looking for them today.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, southern London, while the other opens this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online purchases and the shift of food shopping habits to small local trades, supermarkets need to make more effort to attract buyers.
According to Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to retail stores as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl with the introduction of more services and products other than food.
Since buying the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos classes in hundreds of stores as well as some Habitat classes – this move has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The store chain's previous attempt to lift the face of beauty and medicine classes has failed.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate over the distribution of revenues from the drug classes in its stores put an end to this.
The new strategy was born after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmaceutical business to Celesio, which operates Lloyds pharmacy chain, for EUR 125 million three years ago.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Sainsbury's Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: "By transforming the look of our piperestands, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
In addition, we have hired qualified staff to advise those interested.
Our range of brands caters to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient location provide a seductive edge that takes the shopping experience to a new level.”
Peter Jones "Towel Shop" After Holly Willoughby Cancelled an Agreement worth ?11 Million
The star of Dragons’ Den, Peter Jones, left "broken" after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound agreement on her lifestyle product business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand that sells home wear and accessories.
The two celebrities' businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old host announced on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby pulled the match at Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones when she left their promising lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was a "tom shop" when on Tuesday, at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), he announced that due to his new contracts worth a total of 1.5 million pounds, he no longer had enough time to devote to their common brand of home wear and accessories, Truly.
The two celebrities' businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow and were expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of ?11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from the island to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was supposed to deal with this in the long run, and it will give him his livelihood over the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise for everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as it was so close to departure.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods to sell."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning's host, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost millions of dollars for the business thanks to the huge amounts invested in the range from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear and possible slippages.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
For ten years, the host and husband of three children, Dan Baldwin, had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We do not want to comment on [Jones]’s business affairs.”
They said hard words, "Then we fell in love."
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider "unpresidential", and for saying so positively about the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give in so much?”
Trump asked in a funny “newsreader” voice.
“I didn’t allow anything.”
As he noted, Kim would be happy to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first meeting in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
However, discussions on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees, the United States will not have a "adequate response" to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have provided positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke so unusually about his relationship with Kim.
“Being president is not difficult, but there is not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there are only about 200 people standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Indonesia has hundreds of deaths from tsunamis and earthquakes that subvert the island
Indonesia still refused to help international aid organisations after the earthquake in Lombardy.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had to be evacuated, no disaster at national level was reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In a number of cases, it has been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult,” Sumbaung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian agencies are currently conducting an evaluation of the situation in Palu to see if international aid organisations need to be involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is extremely unprepared to face the devastating power of nature.
Although tsunami sites were built in Aceh Province, this is not common on other coasts.
Although there was a tsunami signal, the obvious lack of a tsunami alarm system in Palu also contributed to the development of a disaster that claimed human lives.
Transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best of times.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three more days before it gets to the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has put the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not saved money on road and railway projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits before next year's elections.
In addition, the president has to face the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority began to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be evacuated due to riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs collided on the streets with bush cutters, bows, arrows, and other heated weapons.
Video: The huge equatorial goal of Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with his 89th-minute goal, so they didn't lose against Chelsea.
His team lost 0-1 when Sturridge received an injection about 30 metres from Chelsea Gate from Xherdan Shaqiri.
First he put the ball to the left, and then he started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high above the sixteenth, and it went towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ended up in the net over Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there’s always someone like Shaq to play the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in position,” Sturridge said in response to a question from LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and I just took it off, and then I didn’t think much, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after winning the lead in the 25th minute with the Belgian star player Eden Hazard's goal.
The blues passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a corner for battle, then managed to break off on the midfield and rush into Liverpool's square.
After a quick injection, Kovaciic started and got the ball back on the midfield.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful handover to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense, and finally sent the ball with a left shot to the far corner at Liverpool's gate near Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Stadio San Paolo arena in Naples as the next stop of the Champions League group matches.
Chelsea is playing Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA European League.
832 victims of tsunami in Indonesia
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency announced on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and the 6-meter-high tsunami waves following it, several people were buried in the ruins, a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, are covered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder
Police are investigating a murder case after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the residents in the area to report anything they've seen or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I would like to ask everyone in Birkenhead around John Street to contact us.
In addition, I would ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to contact us because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body came from in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and for the time being, the police are notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building yet and that no one could leave him.
When he found out what had happened, the man couldn't even speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may take several hours for them to get back into the building.
One of the police officers told someone that the entire building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with tears.
“That’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police minibuses within the cordon and another one outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information, write a message to the address of .MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the telephone number 0800 555 111, and refer to the file of 30 September 247.
Parliament’s Cromwell statue is the latest victim of history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue may be poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers who once destroyed England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is "crazy", an "experiment to rewrite history".
According to John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society: “It was inevitable that, at some point in the current debates on the removal of statues, the Oliver Cromwell statue in front of Westminster Palace would eventually become a target.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of images was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
So perhaps another Cromwell could fall victim to the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell illustration reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure who is still to be celebrated by many today."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell may be less than at the end of the 19th century, but many view him as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which was, of course, the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this conflict in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the further fate of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembering."
A pig killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local press reports, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer to death in a market in southwest China.
Only a man identified by his last name as Yuan was found covered in blood with a torn artery next to the pighouse on the market in the city of Liupanshui in the province of Kujzhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to vaccinate pigs in a breed on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
The man and his cousin traveled up from the nearby province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man’s body and discovered that the door to the neighboring pighouse was open.
According to him, the mouth of the huge boar in the pighouse was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation found that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody, and they were torn apart,” said a relative mentioned by Guiyang Evening News only by his last name, Wu.
According to security cameras, Yuan entered the pigsty at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The leader of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that it could no longer harm others while the police were looking for clues on the spot.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly discussing compensation for the man's death.
Although it does not occur often, there have been reports of pigs attacking people in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales held a farmer for his tractor until his wife managed to scare him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that although pigs are not usually prone to attack, they can become aggressive with the taste of blood.
“They are very playful.
Like little children, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them respect,” he said.
Heavy rains in the wake of Hurricane Rosa in the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, is weakening as it reaches above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rainfall in the northern and southwest parts of Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa struck at 5 a.m. on Sunday, as a Category 1 hurricane with gusts of wind at 140 km/h, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and heading west towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it floods the southwest of the United States with a heavy tropical mist mass as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm can bring up to 25 cm of precipitation to certain areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical mist meeting the approaching low-pressure masses will cause heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here the precipitation of 3-4 cm can cause sudden floods, floods full of debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can bring rainfall between 5 and 10 cm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest there is also a precipitation of 5-6 cm in some parts, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can also occur, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is especially not recommended to walk in the desert.
Due to heavy rains, canyons can turn into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden windstorms and dust clouds.
The approaching low-pressure masses can cause severe rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause minor floods filled with debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Sprinkled tropical showers can apply in Arizona as early as Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday during the day and on Tuesday the rainfall extends to wider areas.
Heavy rainfall will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as Arctic air masses cool down, but tropical ones will remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 10 degrees.
The summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas in the coming days.
In the central and eastern parts of the United States, it is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plain to parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
Long-term weather forecasts indicate that temperatures in eastern parts of the United States are likely to exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh audition
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate was not resolved, and the broadcasters had to interrupt the regular broadcast because of the last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona managed to get the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh touched him at a high school party and tried to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The testimony was probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other channels intervening the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people watching the shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all the channels, Fox News Channel had the highest audience of experts supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
In second place, ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1, NBC by 2.94, MSNBC by 2.89 and CNN by 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement that the senator was voting for Kavanaugh, Friday morning on CNN and CBS, he was seen being greeted by a loud crowd of protesters trying to meet the court committee on an elevator.
He stood watching for minutes while the crowd scolded him, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“I’m standing before you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted to him: “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting channels were then seen live hours later as the committee voted on whether to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for vote.
Flake, however, said that he was only willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced of the need by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and later to other senators.
Flake made the right decision to use his power because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of political games
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who oppose her plans to leave the European Union of threatening the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper right next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU should handle each other's customs is "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was arrested on charges of manslaughter, Baton Rouge's police department announced.
The police released a video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation and announced that Sims' glasses had fallen off during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and Simpson's DNA on it, said on the WAFB channel belonging to CBS' network.
After Simpson was questioned, the police announced that the young man admitted to shooting Sims.
According to Advocate's report, the court set bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report released Friday by the coroner of East Baton Rouge County, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked the Louisiana state police for their task force on escaped criminals, the state police forensics lab, the university police and the residents of the area for their help in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their "committed and persistent work in finding out the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also the LSU basketball player.
Sims reached a 5.6 point and 2.6 bounce average per match in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death "shocked" and "shocked" the team.
“You’re always afraid that something like this will happen,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After volcanic activity increased in the crater and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges took place in 24 hours, the national disaster prevention centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center observed several murmurs and quakes.
In some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windscreens of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists observed an increase in the activity of the volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's divisive break-down referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police that held them back, so the streets crowded with tourists were now covered with dense dust paint.
Later in the day, further fights broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a baton.
The pro-independence groups chanting the slogan "We won't forget, we won't forgive" and the pro-unit protesters lining up behind the slogan "Live Spain" stood up to each other for hours.
According to the local press, 14 people were treated with minor injuries during the demonstrations.
Tensions in the region, steeped in independence efforts, continue to decline in the wake of the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considered illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The electorate voted in favour of separation by a huge majority, although the participation rate was quite low, as most of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting in polling stations with aggressive clashes.
On Friday, pro-independence groups were on the streets all night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not end up on the normal route.
According to a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, there is no chance that Catalonia will gain its independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I’ve seen my parents tear us up for voting, but now we’re on the ground,” he said.
Although a major victory was achieved in the regional elections in December last year, it is difficult for Catalan independence parties to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their best-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are waiting for the court to pass a judgment on their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old car mechanic who recorded the demonstration supporting the police, the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he says.
Catalan leader Oriol Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for office in the European Parliament next year.
“I can most reject the devaluing of democratic values and the repression represented by the Spanish government if I take part in the European elections as a candidate,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their car into the same house
Police arrested a 33-year-old, 34-year-old and 39-year-old man who drove his car to the same house several times in Londonderry.
The incident took place around 19:30 British summer time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car may even have been shot with a crossbow.
With Menga's goal, Livingston beat the Rangers team 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
Livingston, newly admitted to the first class, was a big surprise to the Rangers team by giving Steven Gerrard his second defeat, who has been coaching the ibrox club since 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference because Gary Holt's team got into a dead race with the Hibernian team in second place.
So the Gerrards remained without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they will face the first-place Hearts team, compared to whom they are eight points behind.
Before that, however, Rangers will have a match on Thursday in the European League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its divisional unbeatable series to six wins, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, hasn't lost to the team yet.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against the inaccurately playing guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal of the match, because their attack game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's goal line.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play their own game because they were sure that they could disturb the guests in the recorded game situations.
The decisive goal was born exactly from such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a gap in their defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in ball possession, but the home defense continued to be unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly in danger.
This trend continued during the second half of the match, except for one situation where Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed another free kick from Livingston.
The transverse balls constantly arrived in Livingston's sixteenth, but the defenders saved me every time. Two punitives were not given to the attacking team: one Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other for handing.
"Fenomenal" game from Livingston – match analysis
Tony Macaroni Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston gave a phenomenal performance and reaped the laurels.
The players performed excellently and exceeded expectations.
The members of the team and their style of play have hardly changed since they returned to the forefront, but Holt's efforts also deserve serious recognition, because the coach has really turned the team up since his arrival.
Several players have brought their finest form.
Team captain Halkett played a huge role with his well-organized defense, and Menga sweated Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
The Rangers played without an idea.
As well as they sometimes perform under Gerrard's leadership, they were unable to bring that level now.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – anyway, they only managed to break the home defense once – so the Rangers have to get together quickly, as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdogan received a mixed welcome in Cologne
A pleasant atmosphere and cheerful mood marked the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdogan's divisive visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO members.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters of the president appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdosan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdosan's policy and the German government's decision to receive the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are a great example of the divisive nature of the president's policy, who is celebrated as a hero by some German citizens of Turkish origin, while others see the autocratic in it.
Road accident in Deptford: hit by a bicycle car and lost his life
A cyclist lost his life when he collided with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he died on the spot.
The crash took place just a few months after another bicycle hit-and-run hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
London police said police were still working to establish the man's identity to inform his relatives.
Due to the investigation, road closures and bus stops make it difficult to travel, and the authorities advise that motorists avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured during riots in a highly guarded man's prison, the prison board announced.
The riots started at 09:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire, and they have not yet been contained.
In order to deal with the situation, the authorities sent the special forces called “Tornado” to the scene. Eight prisoners were involved in the riots, who were pushed back into a building wing.
The members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries that were managed on the spot.
Statement by the spokesperson of the penitentiary organization: “A specially trained prison guard team manages the situation in Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence on any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may expect further imprisonment."
The Long Lartin penitentiary has more than 500 inmates, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to be hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, the Special Forces also needed help to overcome a serious riot in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (but the situation in drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but it is expected that this is exactly what the state will expect at the beginning of next week when the remnant of the hurricane called Rosa sweeps through the desert southwestern region, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparedness from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to cross the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rains.
The Phoenix Weather Service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within a 200-mile radius of Phonenix in the form of tropical storms or depression!
For example, Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached the border 40 miles away."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict a precipitation of 50-100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Siklás Mountains, Great Basin, etc.) 25-50 mm precipitation can be expected, but in some places 100 mm may fall.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning floods, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods pose a serious threat, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on the southwestern regions with drought.
“According to the U.S. drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by a minimum of extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” said weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the peninsula of Lower California, Mexico.
It will continue to be hurricane-powered, and on Sunday morning, bringing a wind of up to 137 km/h, it will travel some 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land language in Mexico and will go north at a speed of approximately 19 km/h.
The storm in the Pacific will encounter colder currents and will lose its strength.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coast of Mexico as a tropical storm again on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the chance of floods.
“Rainfalls can result in an average rainfall of 70 to 150 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where 250 mm precipitation may occur in some places,” says weather.com.
Rosa then moves north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday, in the form of tropical depression, to reach southern Utah by Tuesday night, sweeping Arizona.
“The greatest threat to Rosa and her remains will be the extreme rainfall expected in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning floods and gurney flows in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 04:00 local time, an injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, and his condition is "stable".
Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities are asking the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone recording of what happened.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party's "malice and anger"
“He who votes for Judge Kavanaugh will vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer the Democratic Party's "malice and anger" during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that the man had committed sexual violence against him decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood up for his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president said that "the Americans could see with their own eyes" that day Kavanaugh's "brilliant and fearless character".
“The votes cast for Judge Kavanaugh are votes cast for one of the finest legal experts of our time, with an immaculate public service record,” Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president implicitly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I’m not going in person, but I’m actually going in,” he said.
“I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the tactics of "resistance and obstruction".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican advisor told CNN.
Hundreds died in a tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of dead is rising.
Many were swept away by the flood, and at least 384 people were killed when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, said local authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in Palu on Friday, when the waves of nearly six metres (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, swept many away and destroyed everything that got in their way.
The tsunami was triggered by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami warning came up yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, did not flee immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency (BNPB) at a press conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come on its own, it carried cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before it reached the coast.
Some climbed up to the top of trees from the flood and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
Air images of the disaster published by the agency show a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes were detected in an area of about 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said Friday's earthquake released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions may have strengthened the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was "significant", thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and then he added that the number of injured people so far is 540 and 29 others are looking for them.
According to Nugroho's statement, on the coast 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, in the area called Donggala, the number of injured and the damage caused may be even greater as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“Communication is completely paralyzed, there is no way to get information about Donggala,” Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s experts and volunteers are already on their way to the disaster area.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse,” they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about the fact that it did not inform the population about the tsunami that hit Palut, but according to the management, the waves reached the coast as soon as the alarm was released.
One of the amateur videos shared on social media shows a man trying to warn those on the street of the approaching tsunami with desperate cries from the upper floor of a building.
Within a few minutes, a huge water wall hits the beach, driving cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to verify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, making communication in the Palu area impossible, making it harder for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army has sent relief shipments from Jakarta and other cities by cargo aircraft, but authorities say the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to facilitate aid work, and it is closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up in Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found refuge under tent tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of the office, but during their journey they met traces of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
“The situation is very bad.”
While relief teams began preparing disaster relief work, some complained that foreign professionals with extensive experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, all aid, relief and personnel from overseas can only be allowed into the territory of the country if the site of the disaster is declared a disaster area at national level.
That hasn't happened yet.
“The incident is still being treated as a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government admits that this is indeed a disaster at national level, we can let international aid services in, but no announcement has yet been made.”
On the second night after Friday's quake and tsunami, Palun's friends and family of the missing continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape would smuggle some light into the dark atmosphere of reports of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who was trapped in ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two competitors for the Asian Games, which was held in Indonesia at the beginning of the month.
In addition to the missing, other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a paraglider, what happened puts a great deal of spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among paragliders, for hours he desperately tried to reach competitors who had just attended the beach festival in Palun on WhatsApp.
In addition to the messages, however, instead of two blue pipes, only one grey pipe appeared.
“I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 kidnapped while charging a ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves kidnapped $26,750 from a Brink’s employee who was filling an ATM with cash at Newport on the Levee shopping mall, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The head of the CIT car was emptying a ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to fill it with additional bills, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man approached Brink’s employee from behind while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses saw several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not indicate the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter with the following message: “The creature previously called Kanye West.”
For some time, 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye, and this was the title of his eighth album released in June.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live's performance, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only an abbreviation for the rapper's current artist name – according to his earlier revelations, it is also of religious importance to West.
“I understand that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier when talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you and I are us and we are all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it's just Ye, which represents the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he now prefers Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-creator, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written together, with hyphens, or in capital letters.
Mexico's president has vowed not to use the military against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promised never to use the force against civilians in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of the student protests in the bloodbath.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that “he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration in the square, causing the death of some 300 people when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young Mexicans – providing monthly financial benefits to students and planning to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors driving young people into the arms of criminal organisations.
The U.S. should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its support for this kind of research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employee of artificial intelligence solutions who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has also announced its plans to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in AI is imminent,” Lee said.
By doubling research funding, the chances of the United States taking the next big step in artificial intelligence could be doubled, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company made investments in Face++, one of China's most important AI companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would take place, because it would be possible to find new future leaders.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the state support they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking the lead in science, it’s big companies,” he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several large university skulls to work in the field of AI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could also greatly help the US's efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically receive a green card,” he said.
China's State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s national science foundation provides support to academic institutions in a similar way as the U.S. National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing $100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which was planning to set up an MI committee on national security, has not taken further action on the matter in months.
Macedonia to hold referendum to change country’s name
Macedonia's population voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "North Macedonia". This step would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country from accepting its EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, whose province is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it claims Greek territory with a similar name, so it has vetoed the country's NATO and EU membership so far.
The two governments made a deal in June on the new name of the state, but according to national opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether there would be a 50% participation rate for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballots is: "Do you support the country's NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the change of name, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying in order to give Macedonia, as one of the countries raised on the ruins of Yugoslavia, a chance to become EU and NATO members.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would be a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament have stated that they feel that they are bound by the result of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the state election committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% up to this point, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (in which 66% of registered voters took part).
“I came to vote for my children because we have a place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted in favour of the name change in Strumica in the referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage as well as chairs and tents for boycotters of the referendum.
“We also support the country’s NATO and EU membership, but we would like to join with pride, with our heads raised, and not through the maid door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration.”
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be expected with investments in Macedonia that the country with more than 20% unemployment needs.
“I think the majority will support our cause because more than 80% of the country’s population basically supports EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after voting.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "insuring the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published by Macedonia’s political research institute on Monday last week, 30-33% of voters are expected to take part in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia shows a 57% turnout on Sunday.
70% of those who want to vote said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be more than 50% by at least one vote.
The nullity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government, which came to power in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City player, scores a goal by eluding the entire Brighton defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took good care of Brighton's defense, so Manchester City won a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
As the first step of the attack, the Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield, and
By running between the three Brighton defenders, he made it out into the open.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He dodged a defender, then ran more than once near the Brighton 16.
Then he passed left to Sterling, who appeared there.
The English striker gave the ball back to Aguero, who finished the operation with his right foot, hitting the right side of the Brighton night watchman Mathew Ryan's gate.
“Aguero has a problem with his leg,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed to play 55 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, he scored a goal at that time."
With Sterling's action, he managed to gain the initial advantage of the blues in the English championship fight.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, on the brightonian side of the square, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful crossball towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played the ball for a while before he started Sterling for the long time.
For the blue battle, he could just flick the ball into the gate before he slipped out of the baseline.
City will play next Tuesday, 12:55 in Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany, with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make it harder for the Rockies
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to get into the afterseason, they had no reason to really try.
However, Scherzer, who is always competitive, is eager to play against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance in the playoffs. Rockies has a one-game advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one comforting place with their 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still waiting for you.
“Regardless of the fact that we no longer have a chance, we can stand up against them by saying that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to be at its peak compared to the whole year.
Of course I want to get on the track like this!"
The Nationals team still has to pick the starting player for Sunday, but according to the news, Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
Scherzer, who took part in a pitching session on Thursday, will be his 34th starting throw on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed D.C. player this season stands with 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3 parts.
Trump campaigning in West Virginia
The president also implicitly referred to the situation around the supreme judge, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
"In November, everything we've done so far is at stake.
We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, the big ones – I don’t run personally, but I’m basically running, which is why I’m going everywhere to support the best candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined, and they can use any means to regain power, see malice and vileness.
It doesn't matter who they're hurting, who they're trampling so that they can have control, they can have power, that's what they want, control and power, but we won't let ourselves be."
According to the president, the Democrats are using "resistance and obstruction".
“You’ve seen all this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and malicious and mean and lying.”
By name, he mentioned Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Court Committee, at which he expressed a loud disapproval of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when, in my own party, Momentum activists decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for her unwavering stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In addition, the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which are ironically the very issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with former leaders.
The invitation to the Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that they wanted a "receptive and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, these Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, however, today the tone has changed, and the promise of a "more restrained, polite" policy has been forgotten, if ever realized.
It is increasingly striking that the Labour Party does not tolerate divergent views and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have recently been increasingly expected to turn my back on my individual opinion and take sides on things that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was national security issues or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, regardless of what I actually said, they start to insult me on social media, they demand my replacement, they criticize the middle-wing policy, and they tell me that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are usually limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow politicians who are forced to stand up to sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but they do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
The reality, however, is that we have given up diversity, and with every "untrustful" motion and every amendment to the electoral rules, the circle of tolerance in the party is narrowing.
Over the years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so outspoken, and then "it'll be okay."
That is not why I entered the political field.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had neglected schools so much that our classroom was almost crumbling, and then I fought for better public care for the most deprived as a local councillor and government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was very clear to everyone what political positions I was taking and on which topics I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why I have to spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my most important message is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of replacement or political purpose will deter me from acting in my own discretion and in the interests of everyone.

Ayr-Melrose 38-19: Ayr breaks undefeated to the top
Two late attempts slightly modified the final result, but there is no doubt about Ayr’s deserved victory in the most entertaining game of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only one of the ten teams to be undefeated.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and superior use of the situation, the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We have had many challenges in our previous games, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, a Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has taken much more advantage of his situations than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to make Frazier Climo points took the advantage of Ayr. Thanks to the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes lent by Warriors, Melrose could have turned the difference down, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make a point.
Climo sweated Ayr's defense with a penalty, just at halftime, then scored a point from a one-man experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half strongly, selling Patrick Anderson's attempt to sell Bagg, reducing the team's disadvantage to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be removed from the field, and in the sequel Ayr further increased its advantage with Stafford McDowall's attempt, whose laurels were reaped with Climo's help.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Ayr, also received a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's attempt to break the pressure on them.
The home team began to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dischargeing Climb without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down from the penalty line behind the Ayr storming team.
Climo sold, which he repeated almost immediately after the start, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry's detachment forward for the fifth attempt at home.
The main character of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it turns out that he has become the head of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes together and plays with his old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth season will be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source at Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to profit from Glasgow's "flowering catering industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, without a coast, hopes the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol around the naval command decorated with sails in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the following motto: “We have a right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
Bolivia, without a coast, still has vivid memories of the lost coast, which Chile took in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, and there is a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have been the most powerful for many decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1st, ending five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with a spirit of belonging and peace, who are looking forward to the end in a positive mood,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are monitoring the decision of the International Court of Justice on projectors, hoping that the Hague Court will stand by Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table after decades of rapsodic attitude so that Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic, indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for next year’s re-election, may lose much with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much if its decision were still favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to judge Chilean territories and has also stipulated in advance that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered less than six months after the closing speeches indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
In addition, the last four years have not only not helped Bolivia's case, but even rejected it.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” he said.
“Because of Morales’ hostile rhetoric, the rest of Chile’s goodwill has gone away.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that court decision-making would have been unusually rapid.
Monday brings Bolivia an “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance to “come out well from the end of 139 years of feud,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the maritime debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it’s time to go beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
He made the remark when it seemed that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had managed to resume the stalled nuclear talks more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
According to Ri, it is "a wish" to believe that the continued sanctions and the American obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean war will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism surrounding Pyongyang's commitment to decommissioning the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows will feature the huge headgear that will soon appear in top-end stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the day, you don’t need to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their 2019 Spring/Summer collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats created a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-raising works on a runway.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with feather-like, wide flanges and almost completely swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories were watermelons embellished with gems, a sorcerer’s hat, and even pineapples, which were not really designed to keep one’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a diving mask, supplemented with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting funnel of ice cream.
If you're into these spectacular pieces, you're lucky.
Style analysts predict that huge hats may be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path trodden by La Bomba, a straw hat with a width of 60 cm that we have already seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the less practical hat conquering social media sites presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the swimsuit model holding it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with rafiabits and a white skin catcher on top, was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacquemus' 2019 Spring/Summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect that by next summer the huge hats and beach bags will appear in the top category clothing stores. The designer has had such an elemental effect on everyone that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools traditionally provide excellent education. In view of the recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed by 2018, which is further strengthened by individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and the position they hold as citizens of the world.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce customized school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language that they understand, it comes to their head.
But if you speak his language, it goes to his heart.”
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with those from other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results from foreign languages.
Sixty-eight percent of all students who studied a foreign language achieved a higher A degree (over 85 percent).
According to data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students received higher A degrees in Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish students reached A degrees.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, the knowledge of which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Vocational Training Commission found that 17 percent of employers said filling vacant positions was difficult due to lack of language skills.
From this we can see that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As foreign languages are expected in more and more workplaces, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will gain lifelong knowledge from which you will have a clear advantage.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically provides a competitive advantage for multilingual applicants.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents did not speak well enough in any foreign language to get involved with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15%) of respondents.
Therefore, it is important to place emphasis on the language teaching of children.
To speak several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children, with which they have a better chance of applying for more important jobs as adults.
Every school in Scotland will have different languages.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you’ll be able to learn multiple languages at independent schools and be trained by educators who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that will equip and equip them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It is not difficult to see that languages remain vital for the future of a country in the current global business environment, and this should be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as an "international communication skill".
Independent schools offer the choice of diverse and quality education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It's not long before the fans who sit on needles to see LeBron James enter the field for the first time in the colors of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play at the opening game of the pre-season Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're going to spend on the field is still in question.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton wrote on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited period of time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play in the early season to be ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will start a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be Trump’s first of five scheduled events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi, which support him.
Now that the vote confirming the candidate for the Supreme Court's vacant seat has been postponed, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the next mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose power over Congress when the votes come in November.
When will Trump’s event in West Virginia begin tonight, and where can it be followed online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling (West Virginia) begins tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern time.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can also be followed online through YouTube's live broadcast.
Trump is also likely to affect this week's hearing of his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which has proved particularly tense in the light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the primary goal of the sudden increase in events is to help Republicans before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the five events next week “will serve to activate voters and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently own in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
“To be able to control Congress is such a critical point of his political plans that the president visits as many states as possible. We are looking forward to a dense campaign period,” a campaign spokesperson told Reuters.
Tonight’s event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Weeling “can bring supporters from the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania and even get into the media coverage of Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will be the second time in the past month to visit West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is not in a favourable position, according to surveys.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intercede in person to be better at the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team fights full shoulders ahead of Sunday singles to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup needed the four matches on Saturday afternoon.
The pendulum of luck and momentum is a rather airy sports concept, yet all players believe in it, mostly during competitions such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead, and they only have four more advantages, so we can say we have the ball,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they finally got a little back slice and can draw encouragement from several things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His bulging victory cries became louder as he progressed with the round, hit with a critical roll and equalized in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were at a double disadvantage after two.
The final roll of the match at hole 15 resulted in a similar cry of joy, a kind that can make the viewer believe that everything is not lost for the American team yet.
“All you have to do is dig deep inside yourself and only care about your own game,” Spieth said.
This is exactly what awaits the players.
Eighteen holes for the chance to leave a mark on you.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair in the Ryder Cup, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but adorable pair has brought four out of four, and they don't seem to be able to make mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not perform above the par on Saturday afternoon, and Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning in the last nine stages.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and the noisy audience, they have become the standard by Sunday, and no one is more expected to secure Europe's victory at Le Golf National with the sun's peace of mind than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once, with one and twice two punches above the par, the first nine holes were filled by the Spanish and the Swedish, which pushed them into a downhill from which they had no chance to climb out.
On Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-ball matches are very entertaining to watch closely thanks to the interaction of the doubles. It is possible to observe who gives what advice, what he does not give, and how the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has so far played better as a team and is starting the last day with a significant advantage, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them have missed it, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after closing Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair, winning two victories against the infirm Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National track.
Thomas Bj arn's European team, which is trying to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team that has always made mistakes during the four-ball matches in the morning, winning the series to 3-1.
America showed more resistance during the fours, bringing two games, but they couldn't make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points out of the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a series, while he and Molinari, who are referred to as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup, which scored four points in four opening matches.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four-ball, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau to a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, sometimes even sparkled his talent, but lost 19 of his 29 matches out of the four-ballers and fours, seven of which in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ballers, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third place in the world rankings – by 2&1.
However, Europe did not succeed on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans two points on Saturday how to do this.
They won a 2&1 victory against the Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ballers, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4&3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice has a team managed to return from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although one draw for Furyk's defending team is enough to hold the trophy.
However, after two days of being only the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unrealistic.
"No way" for North Korea to unilaterally decommission if it does not trust its negotiating partner
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions only increased distrust of the United States of America, and there is no way that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea took "significant and generous steps" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile experiments, closing down the site of nuclear experiments and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, we do not see similar responses from the Americans,” he said.
“Without confidence in America, we feel that our nation’s security is not assured, and in such circumstances there is no way that we can be one-sided and first-time decommissioned.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment at Washington's opposition to the idea of "staged" nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea would receive rewards for the steps taken until then, his statement seemed meaningful because he did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a powerful US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, during which Kim promised to work on "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea is trying to make an official point by the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States of America believes that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington did not give in to strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and that sanctions increase the pressure to impose its will on us, and that it also opposes the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
The idea that we can be brought to our knees by sanctions is a dream of those who do not know us.
The problem is that non-relieving sanctions only increase our suspicions.”
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump would be planned, but the US president specifically mentioned it at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out that three meetings took place between Kim and South Korean President Mun Jein in the last five months, and added: “If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States of America, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, "the evil president", called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also noted that there is still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that no time limit was imposed, i.e. “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be adhered to unwaveringly until the actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament has been achieved.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri during the break of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go very well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making "gengsterlike demands".
In the framework of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to decommission a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes "the right steps."
According to Mun, the "good steps" referred to by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to relax enough.
A new subject at Harvard University this year has encouraged students to sleep more, fighting against the growing macho culture of caffeine-heated all-nighter learning.
An academic has come to the conclusion that students from the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care about themselves.
The course, which he believes to be the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical College and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was encouraged to develop the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only facing this now as a senior?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told the Telegraph.
During the course launched for the first time this year, students will be introduced to the fundamental impact of proper sleep habits on their academic and sporting performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of the university's health service, the university decided to start the course because during the week the students were found extremely sleepless.
The one-hour course also includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee chairs, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness, and why bedtime routines are important.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons to encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change the behavior of our students.
But we believe they have the right to this knowledge – just as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture in which learning a night is a performance continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the constantly increasing pressure on students result in increasing problems from sleeplessness.
Sufficient and quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even protects them from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into starving mode and causes a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year at Harvard, he took one of the professor's courses as a freshman.
He said that what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to defend the launch of a university-level training.
He hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to take part in a similar training program before being placed in the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning for bedtime, a wake-up call for awakening, and learn about the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily knock them out of the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb drove Steven Gerrard's slipped team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to win their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team as manager in 18 matches. So they are eight points behind the first place in the Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship), Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half, and the Rangers' unmotivated team didn't even get close to equalizing.
While the Rangers slipped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place, just because of the goal difference, lagging behind Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties after the beach marker Calum Spence’s head injury forced him to seek medical attention thanks to an object likely thrown from the guests’ stands.
Gerrard changed the team that made it to the semifinal of the Betfred Cup by sweeping Ayr at eight points.
Dead entered the field with the same 11 men from Livingston who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team suppress his opponent's game wherever he got it.
Although the Rangers led the ball possession, Livingston made more of what they got.
In the first two minutes, they could have scored a goal when Menga first injected Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed at Team Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a penalty at the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were able to shoot only two first-half gates, but the former ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with the head of slowly Coulibaly and the weak shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi's attempt at the 34th minute was contrary to the course of the match, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers once again missed a ziccer forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't respond in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball to Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for an easy ending.
Gerrard decided during the break, replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game when he teased the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who brought the impressive form, blocked me in time.
Livingston continued to play exactly the game that suits them, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls one by one.
Holt's team could have taken a greater advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor held the net well and struck Jacobs' position before Lithgow headed from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, in exchange for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
An excerpt from our Sunday breakfast: 30 September 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that may have led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" (Coronado bells) featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, it has become part of pop culture:
Man: "Well, what's the miracle?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. It can be used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms released because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen, he's really bouncing right now."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in his invention bearing his name.
The new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
The new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
This is how they can "see" the protein that accompanies a variety of cancers. Treated immune cells are injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has achieved promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
Part of the method is the extraction of immune cells from the patient; they are modified in the laboratory to "see" a protein called HER2, which is a frequent accompaniment of several cancers; then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectum cancer,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method based on highlighting immune cells and "teaching" them how to attack cancer cells has already been successfully used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
The performance of Kanye West SNL wearing the MAGA cap culminated in a defamatory tirad in support of Trump.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was whistled at the Saturday Night Live studio after an incoherent statement in which he praised US President Donald Trump and then said that he would apply for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in Make America's Great Again hat, he began to speak against the Democrats and once again emphasized his support for Trump.
“Sometimes when I talk to someone who’s white, they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s racist?’
“If I were interested in racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn't on the air, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West by uploading it.
West even complained to the audience that he was being teased behind the scenes about his hat.
“I was scared behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t go out in that hat.”
I'm intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try with love."
His manifestations were accompanied at least twice by whistles from the audience, and the characters of SNL apparently felt embarrassed, according to one of the eyewitnesses to Variety: “The whole studio was covered in silent silence.”
West was invited instead of singer Ariana Grande at the last minute, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West raised questions when he performed his song I Love it dressed as Perrier glass.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU for MEETING ME WITH THE FIRE.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply "you, and that's great."
“But I have decided NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his fashion items or by supporting his ‘art’) whom I believe to own and spread an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
But so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's in Diddy's footsteps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
Rapper's partner Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant stabbing accused of attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to face the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, the Star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow of Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent fantasy series set in the Middle Ages, he himself often grabs a sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke against stereotypical macho heroes, highlighting that in view of such heroes, little boys often feel that hard action is necessary to earn respect.
Kit said in a statement to The Sunday Times Culture that he thought "something went wrong" and asked how the problem of the harmful effect of exaggerated masculinity could be addressed in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie, said that she thought it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I personally am deeply affected by this case – how is the depiction of masculinity so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men when we were kids about the problem we’re facing now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculinity, since the shows often contain very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is it that we are born with, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and TV say to young boys, which makes them feel like they can only be men in this way?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because there is clearly something wrong with young men.”
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season end of the series, he will not be in Game of Thrones series or sequels, because "he has had enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the main role in the recycling of Sam Shepard's True West film, which is about a producer and his robbery brother.
The actor said that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife, Rose, who he met while making the show.
“I met my wife on the set, so I owe my future family and my life ahead of me to the show,” Kit said.
He played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: Number of new patients in China increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, this means more than 820,000 people.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to previous cases, it is a change that a significant majority of newly infected people catch the disease sexually.
The disease had previously spread rapidly through infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Junnan Province said that the number of such cases has since fallen to nearly zero.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-70% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the disease spreads in these relationships due to inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been providing universal access to HIV medicines as part of a program to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members leaked data from Republican senators and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters rejected charges on Saturday that a member of her staff published the personal data of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Los Angeles Democratic Representative, the claims in question were distributed by "extremist right-wing" experts and websites.
“It’s a lie, a lie, and more vile lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information was said to contain the addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday. The publisher is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh on sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, say the source IP address is linked to Waters' office, and have also provided data on a member of Waters' staff, writes The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously lying,” Waters continued.
– My crew member is not responsible for any leaks of information. However, his right to anonymity, personal data protection and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Waters' statements were quickly criticized on the Internet, including Ari Fleischer, former press secretary of the White House.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
According to this, Waters does not seem to have the temperament necessary for his office.
If someone is accused of something they haven't committed, they can't react angryly.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Waters' reaction was compared to Fleischer's seemingly Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, who is a Republican candidate for Waters' position in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's serious," he wrote in his message.
Waters wrote in his statement that his office had notified the "adequate authorities and law enforcement bodies" of the false accusations.
“We take care that the perpetrators become known,” Waters continued, “and that they are legally held responsible for all acts that endanger or harm any member of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's paralyzing spy comedy
Today, it has become a tradition that in every British-related film we are looking for references to Brexit, and there can be no exception to the Johnny English franchise, the first part of which, Johnny English, was reloaded in 2003 and Johnny English, was released to the cinemas in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation be sarcastic satire, which parodys ourselves, in which we live on our own obvious paralysing?
What is certain is that the garbage-throwing, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for another return – it is clear from his name that this comic character was created so that crowds of viewers in the cinemas of non-English-speaking countries of the world could laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is a crazy secret agent who thinks he's charming with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the theme song of the Fire Wheels at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics with a single keystroke.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial who left chaos everywhere.
There are some good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and then the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comical vein prevails well in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it even seems unnecessary, since nowadays franchises with a "serious" tone, such as James Bond films or Mission Impossible series, have the courage to touch the instrument of humor.
To feel that the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and to me Johnny English's crazy, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the top-secret online network of the British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest terror of the on-call agent Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This could be the last nail in the coffin of the conceited and divisive Prime Minister, whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically playing Theresa May and bringing everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors will outline to him that since the identity of all active agents has been revealed, he must put a retired agent on the job.
Of course, this retired agent is Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at a prestigious school since his retirement, but, unlike the curriculum, teaches children to spy – of course, there are funny scenes here, while English describes the basics of espionage in a kind of "Rocksuli" way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where at the emergency briefing, he meets his former long-suffering gun carrier, Bough, who is now played by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married ever since, and married the captain of a submarine whose mouth is always up to his ears – the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
So His Majesty's national security service pair "Batman and Robin" takes action again and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, played by beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly entangled in the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy plays him.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: disguised as waiters, they burn down a fancy French restaurant, then smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in an amazing mess, and English actually frees hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR headset.
These stations are needed to get to the end, but no matter how cheerful and twisty it is, it may give the impression of a child's film a little too much.
The end result is quite mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I still have the question: couldn't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day working week while paying the British a five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day working week, all in such a way that workers would work for five days' wages.
The party allegedly wants workers to benefit from the AI revolution by giving employees an extra day off thanks to increased revenue.
According to the plan, employees would get a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea "fits" into the party's economic programme, which aims to tilt the balance on the side of the workers in the country.
The idea of a four-day working week is also supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, so workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's program to tilt the balance to the workers in the economy, and also fits into the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned with the promise of a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and "benefiters" of utility companies.
If the plans of the shadow minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not receive back their full profits, because a Labour government would make "deductions" as a punishment for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to make the workers a member of the board of directors and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private companies to employees, so that they could gain an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy told me on the show "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week later than the original date, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election as supreme judge will be held.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their mind about.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his South Carolina colleague.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
His answer was clear and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take extremely serious accusations to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the allegations,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
The annual music event, the Global Citizen Festival, begins on Saturday in New York City. World stars perform at the festival to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held for the seventh time, and tens of thousands of people are expected to spend the Great Lawn of Central Park, where participants can not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes' performance, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first organized in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international advocacy group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
Those who undertake certain tasks or “acts” such as volunteering, sending an email to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity with which they can draw attention to the purpose of the project: the eradication of poverty may receive free tickets for the concert.
But how successful has the Global Citizen really been over the past 12 years in achieving the goals set?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with a concert ticket to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "clicctivism" when people feel that they have made a meaningful contribution to a case by signing or writing an online petition on Twitter?
Since 2011, according to data from the Global Citizen, more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by the project supporters, which have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to the allocation of 37 billion dollars by world leaders to poverty policies and commitments that could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and announcements were from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid or collected during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected has already directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership between investors and contractors based in the UK to "help children achieve their potential". The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help end hunger after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
“With the support of the UK government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, social injustice and malnutrition can be banished into the footnotes of history books,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after more than 5,000 actions were requested by the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children, the government has earmarked funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen website is: “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?”
According to the Global Citizen’s answer: “It will be a long and difficult journey, in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like the previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we achieve our goal because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year's New York event, and the hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. to use naval “blockade” to block Russian energy exports
"If necessary, Washington would use the Navy to stop Russian energy from entering the market, such as Russian energy in the Middle East," said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, especially as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America is able to ensure with its Navy that maritime routes are open and can block them if necessary, so it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's action against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be economically sanctioned in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, calling Russia a “one-dimensional economy”, pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration’s plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the leading officials of the Trump administration, including the President himself, persuade Germany to retreat from the "incorrect" pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a hostage in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion USD Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is an economic project only.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume that we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” Russia’s energy minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans went backwards because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said after a recent meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren “will seriously consider” running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, she would “seriously consider” running for president.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a city meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and repair a dysfunctional government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said that he thought he was "taking the country in the wrong direction".
“I am watching with great concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren has outspokenly criticized Trump and Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren wrote, "Well, of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, according to a survey published on Thursday, the majority of Warren Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Analysis Center of Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren "with a good chance" said that the senator should not run for president until
32% support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick's former governor's presidential nomination would be supported by the majority of the respondents, 38%, and 48% would oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election included the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to start by January.
Sarah Palin's track reference to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after applying in September
He was arrested Monday night for domestic violence.
“What my son has been going through since he returned home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of the PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are going home with,” Sarah Palin told the audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He called Palin’s son’s arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that, like other war veterans, his son “returned changed, hardened, and constantly wondered if there was sufficient respect for the service that their comrades, pilots, and all other members of the army did for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin also reported that he committed domestic violence with a gun and drunk.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 member states and Washington D.C. also support a judicial review of the new US asylum policy to prevent those fleeing gang or domestic violence from receiving asylum.
Representatives from 18 different Member States, as well as Washington D.C., wrote an expert letter Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who is attacking policy in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case initiated by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been made public.
The plaintiff claimed that her partner and “sons of a violent gang” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20th.
She's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications to the United States come from, as there is a continuous problem of gang and domestic violence in these countries.
The new U.S. refugee policy withdrew a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA), according to which immigrants without documents could apply for asylum on the run from domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Washington, D.C., stated in a statement on Friday that the new policy “will ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed according to the facts and circumstances that exist in the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the expert wrote.
Prosecutors also explained in the letter that immigration rejection policy is harmful to the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest levels of jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gangs.
“The right to asylum belongs to those who leave their country for reasons of race, religion, nationality, belonging to a particular social group, persecution for political convictions, or a well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said on June 11.
Asylum has not been designed to solve all the problems that people around the world face every day, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue mission in Palu, death toll doubled, rescue teams race against time
The situation of the survivors is becoming increasingly hopeless.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, while calming her feverish son in a disaster-stricken evacuation center in Palu.
Paramedics bring the bodies every minute.
We barely have drinking water.”
Some of the residents returned to their destroyed homes to rescue them from the wet things that could still be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are not able to supply people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulders, were transported to Palui Military Hospital. The patients were treated outside the hospital building because of the high aftershocks.
The man’s eyes were filled with tears when he recalled how the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he and his wife and daughter were occupied, trembled into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was trapped in the fallen walls,” Haris told Associated Press and added that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of blaming the country with propaganda ads
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that emphasized the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade relations.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to an ad published in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest-selling newspaper, while accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections on November 6th.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections is a new stage in Washington’s increasingly strong action against China, according to some US officials who have told Reuters, aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, there is an increasing trade war between Beijing and Washington, during which more and more tariffs are imposed on each other's imports.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, Chinese tariffs in response sought to target exporters of states in which Trump and the Republican Party were popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who served for several cycles, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses because the state of Iowa exports a significant amount of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion article at the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is still exasperating our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and press by spreading propaganda in paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
However, if we go to a newspaper vendor in Beijing, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the different, different views of the Chinese people on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “one of China’s most prestigious newspapers refused to bring down” his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts Say Republicans Could Alienate Female Voters With Kavanaugh Scandal Before Midterm Elections
Analysts say it could go back to the fact that many high-ranking Republican politicians defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, especially losing support for women voters before the mid-term elections.
The incident triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be retracted, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in a Saturday article on The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the FBI investigation proposed at the last minute by Republican Senator Jeff Flake will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – not tomorrow, not November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, a progressive group in Washington, D.C., on Friday.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning in the Senate corridor, some protesters chanted, "November is coming!" because despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republican-controlled Justice Committee decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will leap to an amazing degree,” independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site.
“Many people say it’s already been very high, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the insecure female voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years old), who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not go to vote."
Analysts have assumed, even before Ford's public testimony, that he could strike back at Republicans if they continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail in his testimony why he accuses the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party was on a rough spot,” said former president of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele, according to NBC News earlier this week.
“This is not only about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and how they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Bureau of Democratic Elections.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite divided as to whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony in full or more, and 35% of respondents gave the same answer at Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said Kavanaugh probably or surely lied in his testimony, while only 30% of Ford respondents believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford's claims, as well as the claims of another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh was drunk on him when he was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web will launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "to gain control of the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said about the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application with Solid's technology allows people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available from the same browser at the same time.
In a personal online data warehouse, it is unique that the user can decide in its entirety who has access to his or her data.
The company calls this "implementation of the right of persons to self-determination over data".
John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, said the company’s mission is to provide resources, processes and the right skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contract developers working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt site.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask “Facebook and Google to introduce the technology that brings full change, which would turn the business models of companies completely upside down overnight.”
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
In a post published on Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt “is a mission to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built network on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts University of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been involved in debates on the neutrality of the Internet as an important opinion-maker.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute, despite the launch of Inrupt.
“I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the World Wide Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann, a minister serving in the First World War of Victoria
The only Anglican pastor who received the Victoria Cross is celebrated by his hometown 100 years after he performed his heroic act in World War I.
Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann earned the medal during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest honor of the British armed forces.
The memorial stone in his honor was exposed by his two grandchildren at the Saturday ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolic” that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s honorable act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel on 29 September 1918 "in the midst of thick fog and fierce cannon and machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the front line and “exceptional heroism” led the battalion, and then he stormed a camp cannon task force on his own, disposing of three members.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel were shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never live up to what my grandfather did, and that has taught me humility,” said 72-year-old Michael Vann.
After the march led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, crowned the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said that he felt honored to play a role at the ceremony and added: “The valour of a real hero is demonstrated by how many people later express their respect for him.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 broadcast, instead they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you've been on the watch all night to see the exciting Bellator 206, and the broadcast is cancelled.
The San José programme featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night as part of the main competition programme on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the viewers in England, instead of the match, Peppa pig was on the show.
This was resented by many who stayed up until the morning hours because of this clash.
Instead of the MMA game, one fan called the children's cartoon "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
“According to state regulations, this kind of content can no longer be broadcast by the network at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of communications and marketing at Bellator.
“Yes, it’s Peppa, the time of the pig.”
Scott Coker, President of Bellator Corporation, promised that in the future the schedule of the show would be revised to take into account viewers in the United Kingdom.
“I think we can do it again,” Coker said.
However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, until the Sunday of our time, which is already Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first, we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix the mistake.
But that was not the case, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
Instead of the six so far, there will be only five matches in the program – we really wanted to please the audience, but we accounted for ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex due to his sexual orientation
Tom Daley said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexual orientation, but that's what motivated him to be successful.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him.”
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne told host Lauren Laverne that she stood up for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of the long-lived show, missed several months because of illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who was invited as a "shipbroken" said that as a young man, he felt "less" than anyone else, because "socially it was not accepted if someone loved boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and otherness from which I draw perseverance and strength to achieve my successes.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth something, too, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community, and taking advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, he asked the governments of the world to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said he spoke up because he felt lucky to live his life openly without negative consequences and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was “fully surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter 20 years older than him married last year, and he claims that the age difference was never a problem between them.
“If you’re going through so much when you’re young,” he said, “you’ve been to your first Olympics when you were 14 and your father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of your own age who’s had similar extreme experiences.
In June, the couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who, according to Daley's own admission, completely upset his attitude to the world.
“If I had been asked this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what I realized? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child's name was named after Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets for the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t answer him, ‘Daddy, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of an audience at home at the Olympic Games, there’s nothing better than that,” he said.
Heather Small Proud's song helped her a lot during the Olympic preparation, and to this day she will have goose skins if she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson wasn't in shape, and he was on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in his 47th Cup match at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays the record for the 12th time at the biennial event, but because of his performance in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches, team captain Jim Furyk sent him to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events with five winners in large tournaments, as so many times as they had to fight for the victory of the United States, he now cheers for his team in one half of the day, spends the other half practicing on the field and tries to correct the mistakes that weaken his game.
At the top of his career, he was never one of the most accurate bats, so the 48-year-old player does not really lie on the narrow track of Le Golf National, where high grass makes it a very high price for wrong punches.
And if the track itself wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact English champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who won all four of his matches this week on the starting Tommy Fleetwood team.
If Americans with a four-point disadvantage start strong before the 12 individual matches, Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in today’s development. He patted my back, embraced me, and promised that he would be ready by tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He's one of the biggest and he's done a lot for the team in the past and in the last week.
Basically, I didn't mean two games for him.
I planned more, but in this situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's performance on Sunday, he's going to break Nick Faldo's record, who no one's ever played in the Ryder Cup.
This allows you to close a series at the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draw, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player does not bring tangible benefits to the team.
“Funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with the others, he’s a great team member,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed playing against him and it’s good to see that.
His presence goes beyond playing in a strict sense."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bj arn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets into the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, luck can easily turn its back on him.
The Danish player presented himself for the first time in a game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and by the end they barely managed to retain a hair of an advantage for the 141-2-1-1-2 victory.
“We always have to remind ourselves that even though we gained a great advantage in Valderrama, we won only a hair’s length, and we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally lost,” said Bj arn, after the 2018 class’s 5-0 Friday and yesterday’s victory, leading to 10-2 at Le Golf National.
“It’s enough to think about the races of previous years, and everyone can already see that the game is not over yet.
Tomorrow, you'll have to play full power.
So let's go and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I mostly deal with the 12 players in our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happen to be one of the biggest players in the world."
Proud of the team’s performance on a difficult track, Bj arn added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a different day.
Then everything depends on individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It's great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, you'll find out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what you need to make the players understand that tomorrow they'll bring out the best in themselves on the field.
They have to break away from their partner, who will also have to bring his best form."
Unlike Bj arn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent's team, strongly trusts that his players perform better in singles than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the losing side after the brilliant performance of the European team called the "medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when asked because he encouraged the players before the last day, team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we’re best off with a start as fast as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
If one of the teams really gets into it, it puts a lot of pressure on the opponent's players during the middle games.
So we put together the order and prepared our players to do a real miracle tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of leading the effort to reverse the job and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I decided on this order because I think this is how the picture comes together from the beginning to the end,” Bj arn added to the individual set-up.
The transfer of Germany's newest warship has been postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to various system errors and exponentially increasing costs, this will be at least until next year.
The inauguration of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg class frigate flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit weekly wrote, quoting a spokesperson for the army.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the continuous delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class aging frigates.
It is believed to have a high-fire cannon and will be equipped with various anti-aircraft missiles and cloaking technology, including a signal absorber that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it needs maintenance less often, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the mother ports.
However, due to the continuous delay in the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may become obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The heavy F125 frigate was headlined last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
Not much information has come to light about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentions several critical "software and hardware errors" that make the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on Baden-Württemberg class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7,000 tonnes “Rheinland-Pfalz” is said to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships set up by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), while the initial plan counted EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the fact that Germany’s presence at sea has been warned to be declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently admitted that the Navy is "starting to run out of warships".
According to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-excited process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be dismantled, but there are no more ships to replace the lost ones.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a Scottish-Highland estate to find out how bats exploit the characteristics of the landscape during hunting.
The researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which may also benefit future species protection initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden area in Wester Ross.
At the right points in the area, special recording devices are placed to record bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use hand-held detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the audio material of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species is doing.
Researchers also create a habitat map and report to determine in detail how animals behave depending on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS conservation advisor, hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and which species use them.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the design of meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the size of bat populations has decreased significantly over the last century.
Construction and land development work disrupts animal sleeping areas and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are fly papers placed out, certain chemical processes used for building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't really completely blind.
Because of their night predatory nature, however, they rely much more on their hearing when hunting prey than on their sight.
Based on the reflection of ultrasound, they can determine the exact position of insects and landmarks on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-place tests and sometimes participate in rescue work.
The organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat trees.
According to David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here in Threeve, bats have a great place,” he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else you need for a good living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, and thanks to the work done here and in other areas, we can learn more about what they need to feel good about themselves.”
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as the destruction of a single colony could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment, and habitat disturbance are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There is still a lot we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information about the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers file lawsuits against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape against him "false news". In his opinion, others want to use his name to "get into the public consciousness".
The football player's lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
A member of the Portuguese squad and the Battle of Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the charges came to light, 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million fan base in an Instagram Live video that the news was "lie".
“No, no, no, no and no.
What they said about me today is all a lie,” the five-time gold ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to become famous with my name, that's the life of public figures.
I am a happy person and my life is fine,” the player added, accompanied by a smile.
Because of the allegations, which were called "unacceptable suspicions that violate privacy", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, Reuters writes.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will claim compensation “to the extent that the moral damage caused is due to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The incident happened in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite where the man anally raped a woman, standing in documents filed with Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent good boy”, except for “one percent”.
According to the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police, and in a hospital she had a sighting of her injuries, but later she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of retribution" and "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman wants to repeal the agreement now, as the trauma caused by the case in question continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret' loss of car factories forever
The UK will “regret forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Minister Greg Clark.
He added: “Toyota UK is concerned” about its statement to the BBC that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, delays at borders could cause jobs to disappear.
Last year, the production unit of Toyota Auris and Avensis produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if the UK falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s executive director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) also expressed concern about the possibility that the country would leave the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Miniket plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, the disruptions at the borders, according to industry representatives, could lead to production delays and a lack of parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store enough parts for more than a day at its plant in Derbyshire, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, was "exactly compiled in such a way as to avoid late checks at the border."
“We want an agreement on the best possible terms to not only reap the fruits of our current successes, but also offer new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our supply chain, which is currently extremely successful.”
Toyota could not tell how long production would last, but warned that the combined costs could worsen the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which could eventually lead to job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked 24 years at the Burnaston plant and is currently representing the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, the jobs that will be lost at this time will never be returned.”
One government spokesperson said: “We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations.”
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, the White House said.
“Another week could be postponed,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting, as the debate over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines Russian influence on elections, possible relations between Trump's advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months, Washington has been wondering if Trump will eventually dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk.
According to this month's New York Times report, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting wearing a wire to record a conversation with the president, and the question was whether it would be possible to replace Trump on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied what had been said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House and there was a rumor that he was submitting his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then present before the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "not like" to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that he wouldn't collide with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women suspected of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which postponed the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a date yet, we can even set it for this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another week of postponement.
We'll find out soon, and I'll, as always, notify the press."
Some journalists, however, doubted this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not due to his opposition to the "sensational" behavior of television reporters, but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are truly sensationalists."
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and press representatives would take place more often.
“The president gives more questions and answers than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without supporting the claim: “We looked at the numbers.”
“If the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it’s light-years better than talking to me.”
We often try to do this, and in the last few weeks there have been a number of such occasions, so they can talk to the President of the United States in person instead of the press conferences in the White House."
Trump regularly answers reporters’ questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences held alone are quite rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week when the president in New York performed an unusual and sometimes bizarre performance in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health ministry has sent a letter to NHS Scotland’s European Union staff about concerns about Brexit.
The head of the health ministry expressed the country’s gratitude in a letter to the employees of the NHS from the countries of the European Union in Scotland, and stressed that he hoped to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs related to established applications for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations on the withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to result in a decision in the autumn.
The UK government has also begun to prepare a scenario without agreement.
I am aware of what a disturbing time this could be for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise in the work of the Health Ministry, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is completely your home and we would very much like you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie underwent urgent surgery after suffering a head injury.
On the Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, an emergency surgery was carried out after he suffered a head injury on Saturday in a 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half.
“He walked to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and members of the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side of the track, then put it on a stretcher and took it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter, that Abercrombie was over the surgery that was carried out at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “he does not yet know any further details about the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-long sophomore student, spends his first season on the Tennessee State team, where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful outfits before leaving the field, so he's already at 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for properties purchased in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for real estate purchased in the UK, and the additional income from it would support homeless people.
This step would neutralise Corbyn's success among young voters.
The tax increase is aimed at those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
According to the Treasury’s calculations, this would amount to 120 million pounds of revenue per year, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for the properties purchased in the UK, and the additional revenue will be used to support the homeless, Theresa May is about to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to counter the success Jeremy Corbyn has achieved among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who do not tax in the UK and the additional revenue will be used to fight homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current levy, which is to be calculated in addition to the higher levy on second homes and real estate purchased for expenditure two years ago, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury expects an annual revenue of EUR 120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by citizens outside the UK, causing a significant price increase, resulting in an increasingly difficult situation for first home buyers.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become "spirit cities", especially in the capital, as many foreign customers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill came just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in levies to help young people prepare to wait for their first home.
He personally considers the construction companies responsible for keeping real estate prices high, who have become a habit of buying and leaving land. He asked May to cancel the quotas on affordable houses and to do something about the "home market shame" in the country.
Corbyn announced remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including rent control and the abolition of evictions without good reason.
It would also provide more powers and opportunities for councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I would like to dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and to making life better for every generation.
To this end, the real estate market situation must be resolved.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country, as well as companies with foreign interests, to buy real estate as easily as hard-working citizens of England.
Dreams of their own home have become almost inaccessible to too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: "My main desire is to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Jack Ross, the coach of Sunderland, his "main desire" is to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would be happy to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, just three points behind the first-place.
He moved his seat to the Stadium of Light after successfully returning the St. Mirren team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the reserve, Ross said on the Scottish BBC Sportssound.
“When I was a child, I watched the Scottish team play with my father in Hampden, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now the only way I have a chance is to succeed as a club manager."
In Sunderland's management post, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not nervous about having to follow in the footsteps of such big names, and he had previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“At the moment, I’m measuring success by whether I can get the team back to first class.
If we look at the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly in the first-class league, he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back, but it’s more than likely that I will only see my activity here as a success if I manage to get the club back.”
Ross' management career began only three years ago after working as an assistant coach for the Dumbarton team for a while and spent 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Aolla get back on her feet after the team fell back into the third class and won the championship with St. Mirren on the verge of losing in the next season.
Ross claims he feels more confident now than ever in his career as a player, whether in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a really decisive moment,” he recalled as the coach of Alloa.
“I definitely thought that managing was more for me than being a player.
That sounds strange, because I did well, I had quite a good life out of it, and I even had some really memorable moments.
However, the lives of the players are sometimes very hard.
You have to go through a lot every week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie for me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've tasted it, I feel the best in my skin all my adult life."
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportsound Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, beer is best at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of pubs in England in difficulty has increased significantly, but restaurant chains are still under great pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of the CGA business consulting company that compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny period and England’s longer-than-expected World Championships, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in revenue, except that an even greater decline in restaurants could be observed.
The 1.8% decrease in restaurant revenue in June continued to deteriorate in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sold alcohol performed best, who even increased more than the loss in restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also uncomfortable with the long-lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as restaurant operators.
It seems like people prefer to drink at this time of year.
The revenue from drinks from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month, and the revenue from food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality RSM analyst, said: “These results follow the trend since the end of April.
Weather and major community and sporting events continue to be the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue drop of 4.8% can become particularly painful due to constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only be revealed over time whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is a widely accepted industry benchmark, collects and analyzes the performance data of an operator group of 47 members with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds.
One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children (even at the age of 11) has a social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta fake pages" is increasing.
News increases fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students say they have a "main" account that their parents can see
One in five children (even at the age of 11) create a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta fake accounts" is rapidly increasing, referring to Instagram's photo sharing page.
As a result of the news, fear of sharing sexual content increases.
20% of students replied that they had an immaculate "main" account that their parents could see, but they also created private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret side of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenage profile that said, "rape me."
According to a study conducted by the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), representing directors and directors of Digital Awareness UK and independent schools, 40% of 11-14 year olds have two profiles, and 50% have admitted that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said HMC head Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and the board’s chairman, Ian Beattie, said sports decision-makers will be invaluablely helped by the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will help develop Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I was happy to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help the Scottish sports leaders.”
The American athlete, who regularly spoke as an expert on the BBC, won two of his four Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulation disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time, it would be decided if I would ever recover.
It's a man-trying job, but I've managed to recover completely, I can walk again, I'm going to agility training today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
Breast-sucking advertising that resembles cows shares the online community
There was a heated online debate about the advertising of a company that made breast suckers, which compared nursing mothers to milk cows.
Elvie claimed to have developed “the world’s first quiet, wearable breast pump” and advertised the appearance of their product in an ironic commercial evoking music videos, which showed the freedom the device gives to mothers who decapitate their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cowhouse full of straw, while in the background you can hear lyrics featuring the following lines: “Yes, I milk myself, I don’t have a tail” and “If I hadn’t noticed, they weren’t udders, they were my breasts.”
And the chorus says, "I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm pumping, I'm milking girls."
The advertisement published on the company's Facebook page was soon caught in the crossfire of online debates.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed-received comments. According to many, advertising mocks the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
“Advertising the product with very tasteless cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken from them within days," one commenter recalls.
The Elvie breast pump can be placed discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment said: “Yes, it is terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell a breast pump to mothers who can keep their children?”
Someone else added, "It's a completely insensitive ad."
Others came to protect advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "horrible funny."
“I think the idea is brilliant.
I would've bought it right away if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another commenter said: “This is a funny ad for mothers who milk their milk at work or in a toilet who feel like ‘cows’ because of it.
It does not glorify or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that during the dance, they had the discreet breast pump in their bras.
The campaign builds on the feeling that women who use a breast pump sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra, so women can move freely, hold their children in hand, or even move out during breast suction.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallel between women milking their milk and milk cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps and to show in a funny way how our breast pump gives us a sense of freedom compared to this."
Elvie's breast pump wasn't on the news for the first time.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two entered the runway in Marta Jakubowski’s dress while using the product.
Hundreds of young migrants secretly transferred to a camp on the Texas border
The number of children in detention has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can be partly explained by the fact that the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and its actions so far make it more difficult for them to find host homes.
Hosts are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that their chances of staying in the country would be worse if they applied to receive children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that parents applying for admission and adults living with them in the same household would have to give fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement before Congress last week that dozens of people have been arrested who have applied to accommodate unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Eighty percent of those who apply for admission and live in the same household are illegally resident in the country, and a significant part of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear in court within one month of being detained instead of 60 days, according to social workers.
Many people sign up in court via videoconference call instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not provide legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and workers in the system have reported that the longer detention takes, the more nervous and depressed children become, and the chances of violent outbursts or escape attempts increase.
According to human rights defenders, these risks are only increased by a larger facility like Tornillo, where the number of children makes it harder to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they did not provide enough time for children to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they were transferred to such a facility, they would expose them to even greater trauma.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the eight years of civil war in the country.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces illegally entered Syrian territory on the grounds of the fight against terrorism, and "they will be treated like this."
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally,” he told the General Assembly.
Moualem asserted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He stated that Damascus “continues its holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “illegal foreign presence.”
There are 2,000 U.S. soldiers in Syria, most of them as trainers and advisors to Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that the conditions were appropriate for their return, and only "some Western countries" stimulate "irrational fears", deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return home,” he said.
“They made a policy on a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and his opposition on the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone around the last great citadel of insurgents, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented Russian-backed Syrian government forces from launching a widespread attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement set "clear deadlines" and indicated his hope that military actions would only be directed against jihadists, including the An-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which should be "rooted out."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of government and opposition delegates will soon be convened to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the elections.
Moualem, among other conditions, considers the participation of the Syrian government in the committee acceptable, for example, only "revision of certain articles of the current constitution" and warns all external actors against interfering in the process.
That’s why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true and a accountability process or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential finale of all time."
For the time being, however, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its ratings to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC is the most watched cable TV show with its 3.5 million audience, which it achieves on the evenings of the days that bring major news.
“It attracts us like fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the lead producer of ABC’s drama series The Designated Survivor. In this series, a low-ranking mini-serve of the cabinet sits in the presidency after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell is a veteran comedy writer, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”.
This is how he recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why,” Scovell asked.
“It makes me laugh,” the driver said.
It's the entertainment power of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases such as Roe vs. Wade-precedent to reunite immigrant families and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can do so that you do not care about these facts.
However, it is no longer part of responsible information when we are staring at a debate show for the sixth hour, in which we are talking about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket ("the clothing of incarnate arrogance" as the Washington Post puts it), or the consequences of Stormy Daniels Trump's description of his anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'm always gonna think about about Super Mario from now on.
“You feel a little bit like you’re watching a reality show, where we get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, creator of the “Zalogstars”. In Trump’s show, the characters are constantly changing, and the new turns are coming every day (it goes to N.F.L., he starts praising Kim Jongun).
If you miss a single part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny weather in Kauain, yet he was in his house snucking around watching MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't get away from TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Justice Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we did those crazy shows, a lot of people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but they seemed to be right.”

Both parties pour money into the tightest races of the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in Pennsylvania's 17th constituency were spending money uncounted after two active representatives fought for the same chair after the repatriation of the congressional districts.
One of the competitors for the recently redrawn Pittsburgh suburban district is the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate last spring in an interim election.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th constituency, which has a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January found that former district boundaries were manipulated to the benefit of Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the funding body of the two parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), almost bid on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the March interim election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional Constituency.
For more than a decade, the Republicans owned the seat, and Donald Trump won the district with a 20 point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China and then withdrew from the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has hardly responded.
Donald Trump was in a good mood with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization leadership team out of there.
The State Department recalled senior staff members from U.S. branch offices in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of their "nearly recent decision not to support Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, such as financial aid cuts and targeted visa restrictions, would have affected the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are extremely high.
As private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, and its primary goal was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence also spoke at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, is a clear signal of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnation statements or take punitive measures.
White House spokesman John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate, which the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, reported anonymously.
Their reports were supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical experience
The next blow could be a report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has somehow obstructed justice... and a number of public facts suggest that.
Mueller's investigation also allegedly covers whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats get a majority in Congress, they will certainly try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are a lot of uncertain questions, and Trump’s fall is far from inevitable... nor is it for his European principle-friends.
Serious decisions must be made on both sides of the Atlantic, depending on how long the fight will last.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to coup Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
The support was cancelled, so the bloodshed of the following years could not be prevented.
At historical turning points like this, it is decided whether the inevitable development of democracy will accelerate or slow down.
In today's America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been shaking since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that talks with the president be recorded and suggested that Trump was unfit to fill his office.
According to Rosenstein, the Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a seemingly credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is: in the interim election, are we voting for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I hope this is not the case, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once sat in the building that served as my ambassador's home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later asked me to light candles on the table with the sign of swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans at Rangers is confident before the Rapid Wien game
The Rangers will host Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after the unexpected draw against Villarreal in Spain can ensure their participation in the G group of the European League.
Due to the knee injury of the midfielder Graham Dorrans, he was unable to enter the field until the 2-0 match against Villarreal in the season, but he feels that building on this result, Rangers can set themselves bolder goals.
“It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old.
“We believed we were able to score, and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw.
They were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in their last match, but with our fans behind us we will certainly have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the trainings are going well.
I hope that if we give everything we can, we can leave the previous season behind and achieve good results.”
Many women are worried that they are not saving enough for their old age.
The survey participants had precise ideas about what old age care they wanted, but only a small part of them talked to their family members about it.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouses.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
“Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don’t raise the issue,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
The following are worth doing.
First, discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take care of you properly if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, choose where and what care you want; these decisions will significantly affect future costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Financing can be done with a traditional insurance policy designed for old age care, or a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings that can cover expenses or use your own property as collateral... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: This will cut the possibility of later litigation in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person who acts on your behalf on health issues, supervises your medical care, and ensures that everything happens to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Ask someone to manage their finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and takes care of paying your bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Record this data in writing so that it is available at any time.
“It’s not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who your doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”
A man was shot several times with an air gun in Ilfracombe

The police described the shooting around 02:30 local time as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and then a tsunami hit the city of Palu.
The region's communication network has also been damaged, so no news has yet been received from Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes, built on the west coast of the island of Celebes, at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its foundation when it was struck by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala Governorate is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the governorate, a smaller administrative region than the province, was about 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebes is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years.
A 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 inhabitants and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami hit West Donggala, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which is why earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a huge sea quake began on the west coast of the province of Aceh in North Sumatra, which launched a tsunami reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and the tsunami that followed it claimed almost 700 victims on the south coast.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 destroyed near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake shook an island of the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra and sometimes caused a ten-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake reached the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and destruction that followed it reminded many of the memories of the terrible tsunami of 2004.
No escape price was created this time, but more than 100 inhabitants still died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, mainly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the ground, and thousands of tourists have been stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of committing domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and resisting arrest, Alaska State Police said.
According to the police report, when a lady's ID tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su, and he has been bailed out for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered the question of his guilt: “He is not at all guilty.”
Palin is charged with three class A violations, i.e. up to four years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
In addition, he is charged with a class B violation that may result in a one-day detention and a fine of $2,000.
Palin isn't the first time he's got a fight with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaskan Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence and obstruction of reporting the crime, as well as possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed that the man hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by several veteran organizations when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people died after a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Systems responsible for power and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of deaths is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media, a number of videos of the arrival of the tsunami appeared.
Hundreds of people gathered at a ceremony on the coast of Palu, and that's when the tsunami landed.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for New York terror attack suspect
New York federal prosecutors are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people.
The 30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving a truck rented from Home Depot on a bicycle road on the street of Lower Manhattan West Side Highway in October, hit by many pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and was "intentionally" to cause injury, according to the submission of the Prosecutor's Office of the Southern District of New York.
According to the document submitted, proof of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saimov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion killings, which had been used almost exclusively against organized crime and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditated intent", the prosecutors claim, and Saipov, according to their wording, carried out his action in a "horrible, cruel, inhumane way".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York last asked for the death penalty for a defendant for a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was finally sentenced to life imprisonment.
In a federal case in New York, a death sentence was last executed in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Born in Uzbekistan, Saipov, according to court documents, did not show any regrets in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was delighted by what he did.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, according to the indictment.
Police say he asked for an ISIS flag to be put out in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipovot, said that they were "understood" about the prosecutors' decision.
“In our opinion, the actual life imprisonment for a confession would have been more favourable, and the death penalty would only prolong the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” Patton said.
Saipov's defenders have previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty for their client.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage stated at the demonstration during the Tory Conference that he would "call the army of the people into battle".
Ukip's former leader said politicians should feel pressure from Eurosceptics after Theresa May's party partner suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not fill any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have " quit long ago" if Farage were the Brexit Minister.
The pressure on May is well described by the fact that the remaining Torys spoke at another anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires constant laval between Brexit and the pro-resistance and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between his package or "total chaos".
Bone at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull said that the "Chequers deal" had to be eliminated.
He suggested that Farage should be admitted to the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have left,” he said.
The representative of Wellingborough added: “I stand by Brexit, but the Chequers deal has to be eliminated.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the assumption that since the vote in 2016, the public mood has changed: “There is no real basis for the British people to change their minds and want to stay.”
The pro-Brexit Tory representative Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and said to journalists: “All I ask is: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among party membership, and especially among the activists who work in the field and helped us get into government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
As a corner message to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “feel the pressure” so that they do not dare to betray the result of the 2016 referendum.
“Trust between us, the people, and our politicians is at stake,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and today we are gathered to send a message that we will not allow them to do so.”
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I would like our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We call on the people's army to fight to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again."
Meanwhile, the stayers marched in Birmingham and held a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists waved the flag of the "Toryk against Brexit" movement formed this weekend.
The Labour Party Lord Adonis was persuasive with the Conservatives in the application of the party because of security errors at the opening of the conference.
“These people have said they have the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus agreement, a border crossing without disruption and a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders,” he added.
- They're just blabbering.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren "considers carefully" to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would carefully consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the state's Republican representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chaired by Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
For some time now, there have been speculations that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th public forum meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to play a role in restoring the misguided government in Washington, including taking the supreme position”.
Man arrested for shooting Sims in LSU
Police at Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced Friday that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player in LSU.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. East Coast time.
Earlier, they posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the University of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury, which proved fatal,” police captain Murphy J. Paul told media officials on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the interrogation that he was at the scene, had a gun, and he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was arrested at the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
In Baton Rouge, he grew up, nearly 2 meters high Sims played 32 matches in the last season, 10 as a beginner, played an average of 17.4 minutes per match, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is closer to the World Championship title after winning the victory in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified for a better place than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became immediately clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
Bottas from pole position started well and almost got Hamilton in trouble because he defended his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel stood in the boxing street and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the middle field, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes stood out a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton preceded a close action during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner curve free after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the frames, and by the end of the first round it was the seventh.
He then drove most of the race because he didn't change tires to get to the finish line quickly and beat Kimi Raikkenen in the hope of fourth place.
Finally, he stood in the 44th round in the boxing street, but in the remaining eight laps he could not increase his pace, so Raikkenen became the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that he did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but noted that things in the Senate prove that people are "disgusting, hateful and liars".
“What can happen is the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the past few days, when they see anger, when they see people being angry, mean, hateful and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the document? – "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, let's stop for a second.
No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to treat him confidentially and, as requested, to treat him confidentially."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what the situation is: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women by claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by whatever means.
You can see the vileness, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," the president said.

Air traffic control lost its life to save hundreds of people on the plane from the earthquake
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than eight hundred people died, and many disappeared after the island of Celebes was shaken by a significant earthquake on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there so that Batik Air's 6321 flight on the runway could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought he was crashing.
Later, he died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News.
We've prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard the news,” he said.
Authorities fear that the number of deaths could be thousands, and according to the country's disaster response organization, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“The number of victims is likely to continue to increase as many are trapped under the ruins and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the organization.
Waves reaching a height of six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft transport assistance and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “The ambulances bring new bodies every minute.
There's little clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is running against time trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's already a real tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country's soldiers: "I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out evacuation-related tasks!
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes this year on the island of Lombok, where more than 500 people have died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says person missing in lagoon plane crash
According to a recent statement from the airline operating a plane crash in Micronesia, a Pacific lagoon, a man has disappeared, although it has previously been claimed that all 47 passengers and crew have been successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to the Air Niugini press release, according to the situation on Sunday afternoon, he cannot account for a male passenger.
According to the airline, he is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information on the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
According to the airline, six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane flew very low.
“That’s a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes told me that he and others were able to run up to the waist in force water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the air escorts panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who repaired a quay nearby also helped rescue the people and carried them to shore with an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst has compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor told the prosecutor on Saturday at the retrial of the man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to compile the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that showed that he was with Tellis Chambers the night she died, which contradicts the man's earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, during which he said that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "did lie because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip-hoptrio called the negative approach to the genre to sheep by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, hiphop has drifted away from its roots in political messages and social problems.
They want to return to these roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is he a black man again?
New York Nanny sued for dismissal of a party after a “racist” message
A New York nurse filed a lawsuit against a couple for being dismissed as a result of discrimination after the mother complained in a message wrongly sent to her that they had managed to employ a "black" nurse again.
The couple denies being racists and compares the lawsuit to "coping".
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when in 2016 the new child care provider Giselle Maurice saw that she was black on her first working day.
“NEEEEEEEM, NOW A BLACK!” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after waking up to his blunder, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unpleasant", dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was African-American, did a bad job and expected a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid a day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for dismissal and asking for $350 a day for the six-month residential work he was originally hired for, although without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the march, it can’t be done,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the claims of racism that the termination of Maurice’s application was reasonable because they feared that they could not trust him after he was offended.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone you’ve been rude to, even if you happen to be?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on.
According to Plasco, who likened the lawsuit to "coping", his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
Would you attack someone like that?
It’s not very nice to do that,” the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are in progress, the public court has already quickly convicted the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
According to a recent letter, Paddington's publisher feared that readers would not be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to imagine ourselves in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's kind of fun to have this information now that we know what a huge success Paddington is."
According to him, his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little toy bear, would not have resented his work if his work had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was bittersweet after his father's death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not conceited at all,” he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who was doing something: we are proud of him, even if it’s not really our fault.
I think Paddington's success was somehow seen this way.
Although he created it and came out of his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When he and his daughter landed, they rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating, they slowly ran out and then left his system.
He died before, and then everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning for the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the others who ignored the ordeal she had just been through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I bowed my head and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.”
Postcard with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards full of inspiring messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when she became depressed and then committed suicide when she was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook and that his smile was stuck to everyone.
“He knew everyone’s smile.
They always said that his smile would make any place go up.”
However, before his death, he gave up his work because he was “in very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would cause some domino effect.”
Ms. David created the postcards with the aim of “to let people know that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are just a friend.
Don’t sit quietly – you have to talk.”
Ms. Humphreys, who lost Ms. Davies' girlfriend Mark for years, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of the man's mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed, depressed, or anything,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in attitude.
He was completely down on Christmas Day: when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything like that."
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge void in the family.
He broke our hearts into little pieces.
But we must continue to fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could achieve what he had asked – a limited-time investigation of limited size – we might be able to come to an agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee was afraid of “pieces of corpses” because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance is only due to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away on November 6th, and if it is expected that the Republicans will not perform well, it will be much harder for them to get their man into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues its report?
The Senate is currently holding a vote of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make a decision to include Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's dissidents "decreased" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean dissidents on their way to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok quoted data from the Southern Ministry of Unification and said that in the last year there were 1127 dissidents compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that closer border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on this information publicly.
The majority of northern dissidents will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most of them flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China welcomes dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is still practically at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came with a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they largely agreed on further cooperation on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it is inconceivable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said she was unfit for the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“It occurred to me that if a woman were to behave like that at any time, I would call her ‘hysteric’,” Pelosi explained his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Justice Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested with emotion against rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost shouted and his voice closed when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats of the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character murder", organized by angry liberals because of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s behavior proved that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he’s ruled out his statements and behavior against the Clintons and Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if it filled the post and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"All I'm saying is that if you're not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, it's not only for the Supreme Court, it's not for the court where you're right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Metropolitan Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions about the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would alter the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court and expect us to be happy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's a legitimate outburst, months and years of anger, and you can't get it out of you without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that rare, is it?"
“He told me that he was crying in anger, but he developed a technique according to which, when he started crying in anger, he told his interlocutor: ‘You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
In part, they look at tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, an office dominated by men, where I once cried in my angry helplessness that I was grabbed by an older woman at my neck – a cool manager I was always afraid of – and took me out to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they managed to upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on Monkey Business, and he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in deep frustration, realized that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he said to me laughing 30 years later.
“There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and they wanted the new candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone named him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the fundraising, so she vowed not to compete unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
"Did you think I'd get a discount?" he thought.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the gratitude of the people who supported him, as well as the frustration he felt against the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, and the anger of sexism, that his throat was stuck.
“They must have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder said.
“They thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my tombstone?
“Crying?”
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening fire of the U.S.-China trade war was almost deafening, and although the battle was not nearly over, the break between countries, experts say, could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warnings earlier this year by imposing a tax on the most important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new tariffs already affect $200 billion worth of products, practically taxing half of the goods from China to the USA.
In all cases, Beijing has fought back, most recently imposed tariffs between five and ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the world’s second largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want Washington to back down, that would mean you have to give in to the demands, but public bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, President of China.
Yet, experts say if Beijing is well-tacticed, US trade war pressure could be useful to China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, could create conditions that could plunge any of the economies of the two countries into an economic vortex is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant at the New American Security think tank in Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that died in the war for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the country’s conditions were improving.
“The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and self-imposed economic measures, which affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Six million more people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state welcomes all assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team in 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
The United States has failed for the sixth time in a row on the European scene and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title, as the Danish team captain Thomas Bj arn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, dropped his punch in the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golf player Molinari shone in all circles, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in 1979 in its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 from the lowest-ranking player in the European team, the Danish Thorbj
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against English Ian Poulter, who may have taken part in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the best European winner of the tournament with a career score of 25.5.
“I usually don’t cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
He's so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team, and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after his emotional victory in Europe.
The baton is handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods in 2&1 singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, growing up watching this man,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now he has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, and only Jack Nicklaus overtakes.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing result of the U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, he said: “He is proud of these guys because they fought.
There were times this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup our team and work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move on.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us.”
