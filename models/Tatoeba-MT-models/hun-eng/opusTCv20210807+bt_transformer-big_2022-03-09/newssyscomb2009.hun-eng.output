The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, they have a total of 29%
According to the first preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday brought about a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the Grand Coalition so far and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer has been seriously shaken, has suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial magistrate of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a winning return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and in particular the result is literally disastrous for the People's Party that brought about the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP coalition left, the People's Party had a significant advantage over the SPÖ, according to opinion polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
The first reactions to the results have been speculation about the possible resignation of party president Wilhelm Molterer and current vice chancellor.
The observers believe that this will take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
This development would probably facilitate an increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously won 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the recurrence of 1999 when the People's Party agreed to a joint government with the populists (the FPÖ was still united in 2005, which even triggered sanctions from the BZÖ), which even triggered the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, obviously expects this solution.
The Green Party also entered Parliament, which, however, slightly lost its popularity and fell from the third place to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations could get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal beetle collection could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there could be some estrangement in Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister published this in New York after his meeting with Pranáb Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
"If this were not resolved, then yes, there would be some estrangement," he said after the meeting, which was inspired by the Czech Republic.
Mukherji said after the trial that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr .vácha, which was acquitted of charges and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, which had jurisdiction over the case.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
However, Mukherji said it would be best for Emil Kusera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, to appeal to a higher court.
Then he could apply for bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered to appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to acquit him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole case is to provide “competent legal support” to the prisoner, the Indian Minister mentioned.
However, he said that the Indian side has already provided such assistance.
“It is in our best interest to maintain the best relations with India, which has a long tradition.
This is also acknowledged by the Indians,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the TK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake,” he said.
Asked whether the Indian party had given him a promise to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
"I've already received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges fight for the seabed
He steps up to the wall electronic map showing Australia and neighbouring marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it to the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who belongs to the UN Division's 30-member team on ocean and maritime law.
His boss, Václav Mikulka, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which he sometimes complements.
There's work momentum and enthusiasm here.
The seabed hides a world rich in natural resources, barely known to date.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but so far also unknown living organisms, which may be the key to the development of anticancer medicines, for example.
Seabeds larger than land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new underwater areas.
According to the UN Convention, they enforce their rights, which was agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica in 1982.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometers off the coast of the country.
Such a country shall have the exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf under the Convention.
"In simple terms, we hold that part of the continental shelf and the bottom layer of the seabed which is the natural continuation of the subsea continent.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles, so-called exclusively economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission on the external borders of the Continental Shelf should be complemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
So far, the Commission has negotiated five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
Recently, Australia’s success has been echoed in the world, which has first significantly expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed awarded to it by the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, that is, six times larger than the territory of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits from the future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
They can do so within ten years of the ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right of exploitation in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "some areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is contractually fixed".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed today belongs to the Czech Republic.
This is shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc in the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organization received the so-called "pioneer investor" status under the Convention in 1991, like investors in some other countries.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area inspected by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it's a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
"It can be harvested in a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” mentions another lawyer, Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian member of the division, presents the example of another concretia.
It reminds me of a potato or, with a little imagination, a parchment with magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were present during the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details are coming to light about the release of the 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, in addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, the staff of the GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the rescue.
However, the German forces were not needed, as the hostage takers let their prisoners run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to involve it as an on-site support force.
“Fortunately, this did not happen,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on 19 September.
Following the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt, the hostages were taken back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the saved have arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
For the time being, no information has been provided in Berlin as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the Airbus plane of the German Air Forces.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has defeated the $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets by a small majority.
The Dow Jones fell to the bottom.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite the calls of US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme to contain the chaos in the financial markets did not receive a majority.
The supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Party's negotiators, called on Members to support the plan, even if the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political support to avoid something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Dow Jones dropped more than 6% and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the state rescue package might fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote and then fell again after failure was made public.
Experts expect further severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers are registering more and more bookings.
A good winter is coming for German tour operators.
According to one study, the traffic of road bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the German travel mood did not slow down, according to the study.
For winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
Travel agents’ turnover in October was around 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV said.
These results are based on data from GfK, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took into account trips booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the US is particularly sought-after, the DRV said.
Here, the volume of reservations increased by about one third.
The Germans are also particularly popular destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in domestic landscapes.
“Organized travel is the most sought after,” said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for organized trips are "more calculable for passengers than for individually organized journeys."
Among other things, passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth will be recorded again compared to the previous year, although according to another study, fewer German tourists have undertaken a trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted ballermann hits, liter beers and design dirndl-wearing celebrities.
It's a debut on Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I aren't exactly alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she's wearing a tailor-made dirndl.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress at the thrift store.
But one thing unites us: We've only been on Wiesn for three minutes, and we're already being rushed by photographers and filling their memory cards - it's very flattering, and it's all on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my comfort is still limited by folk costumes.
But when we get to Theresienwiese, it's not so bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dirtlit or leather pants; no one looks distasteful or awkward - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are reaping only my dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I tied the apron wrong: "You're free on the left, virgin in the middle, sold out on the right, widow in the back."
I secretly tied the bow from behind to the left.
"That's good," he says, and he laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirting techniques and wear a simple felt base with the words "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and uninvitedly show their naked butts.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which he finds very fantastic, stretching the "aaaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he got rid of the contents of his former jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone thinks is garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the infamous "forbidden urinators."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics will march through the scene and take care of the poor humidity.
Nurses always show up in a team - four people carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure full.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarp can't be seen.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics shouts to me at my question and then in the whirlwind.
Police named the victim of the accident.
Police named the 63-year-old woman who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
Brentwood resident Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road was killed Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released on bail ever since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, stands one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial effort.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neorenaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms with a tower at each front corner, and it looks like some kind of German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little shaky.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large undertaking this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, wanted to achieve its ambitions to occupy the Middle East with the help of this railway from Damascus to Baghdad to today's Saudi Arabia.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station was no better.
In 1917, an ammunition train exploded and destroyed the well-developed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire Eastern region, it serves, at least symbolically, as the expanding diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours, which gave the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with known Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern, stone-and-steel building specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban district between semi-finished shopping malls and cafés. In the latter, middle-leaders in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
The Cold War has upset order,” he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today, he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
It had to be opened in both directions.
"But is it possible that sooner or later he will have to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to be at a crossroads."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations with not only the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
It is as if they want to convey the message that, figuratively speaking, with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those easterly railway lines.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night, mostly awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the recovery of this fancy structure 100 years ago.
How they would have been surprised to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited in the harbor for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was once called "the sick man of Europe."
At that time, at least there was no question of which continent should claim this exciting country.
Memorable Life Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as musical director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
According to his musical plans for the part of the city, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have been included in the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music that was put in front of it - whether it was madrigal or a Messiaen piece; without accompaniment or with orchestral accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and we owe it to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us, "Let the music speak for itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it!"
His conductor technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerating.
Whatever the standard of music was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there was ever a conductor who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last forty or so years, I have written reviews of more than 100 concerts, but it has never disappointed me, and it has often inspired me.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "walked with one or two well-known battlehorses all over the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25th), "In 1946 he continued his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 he received a scholarship from the Houblon-Norman research institute... while constantly preparing for his basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
It's from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End," but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, while under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51, he was indeed in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
He left Nottingham for good in 1953 and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff embellished this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Humanities
"J. Vicente Resino's exhibition "Flamenco and Life" is recommended because his black and white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as the respect for the people in the photographs, drew my attention.
This exhibition is filled with emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sales record for Honda
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of Jazz.
True, its predecessor had a large enough passenger compartment, but the design of the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
This is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, a number of internal changes have been made to it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we go into detail about the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, we can state that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
Jazz is less known in Europe, but it has sales records in other markets.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since it came on the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, sold nearly half a million examples in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
That is, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz in 2007, by 2009 it is estimated that 100,000 cars will be sold, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market, representing 6.7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary calculate with 2000 examples sold over a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly ease Honda’s decline in traffic in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's market share would be made up of the United States, while the remaining share would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the official presentation in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimetres wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height, on the other hand, remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body on the one hand and the fuel tank in the middle on the other - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double floor luggage compartment has increased, currently exceeding the capacity of the first generation by 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres.
Although this includes that these sizes refer to the 1.4 engine type, the 1.2 Honda Jazz has a trunk of 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as the rear led lamps or the optional panoramic glass roof, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the 67 degrees opening angle of the first Jazz.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both engines is more favourable than the previous model, as well as lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while at the same time the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The 1.2 litre engine has a power of 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which had 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and has 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and emits 128 grams of CO2.
The "Bee Car" Avoiding Collision
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration from nature, specifically the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that imitates the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of crash prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technology Center, in collaboration with the renowned University of Tokyo’s Advanced Science and Technology Research Center, have built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research and Development, defines the BR23C as a further extension of Nissan’s four-tier safety shield.
The robot enhances the ability of the company's products to avoid collisions.
During flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan's safety cover.
More important, however, is the role of the complex eye of the uterus, with which it can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser range finder.
In front of the BR23C, the instrument identifies obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an action to avoid collision.
"As soon as the obstacle is detected, the small robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the instruments currently available is that in this case the avoidance maneuver takes place completely automatically.
If that were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In a way other than bees, the bypass maneuver cannot be directed upwards or downwards, nor can it move diagonally, only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of the turnability of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and manner, as in the case of bees.
That's why Nissan used a rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration in the robot to avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabytes, but we're not even talking about megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which Nissan estimates will enter series production cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional application to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of investment cash, has no lack of common sense.
Because of the crisis around their necks, and so that Americans don't get caught up in the mazes of questionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
It's the "Bad Loans Hotel"... which means it's for the pigeons.
The gloomy face of the accommodation and especially the receptionist suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether it is really time to borrow.
And above all, where to apply for credit, because that's probably the purpose of this.
The information on the website is useful, but not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
What would happen if we added to the game?
For example, the room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, that's something, because we don't dare dream of buying a house...
Morgan Stanley to open up capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's stock price fell sharply on the stock exchange.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% below the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which provide it with a 10% return and a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's share price fell by 6.79% around 17:00 in Greenwich Mean Time, closing at $23.77.
“This strategic alliance provides Morgan Stanley with a great opportunity to accelerate its transformation into a banking holding company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which allows it to diversify its activities, while at the same time being under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
On Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, we thought that the share would consist entirely of ordinary shares,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and prevent possible risks."
In terms of weighted average prices, MUFG pays 7% more than book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share will be reduced by about 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year if the latter's trading price exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that you can use funds from MUFG to take advantage of your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the spokesperson of the group did not want to give accurate information about the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s partnership, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that its balance sheet has improved "definitely" since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of its non-payment risk insurance has skyrocketed.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
Of the big investment banks, only one "survivor" remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had made $15 billion: part of it came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group of companies.
Statement by Rafael Correa on Monday, Quito
Rebuilding the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the example of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa explained his ideas on the new constitution on Sunday.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum according to the official results, which applied to 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were cast unfilled.
The adoption of the draft constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling station exits and a count by a non-governmental organization proved the huge superiority of "yes" votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, meanwhile, spoke of the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution was an overwhelming victory," he said, thanking Ecuadorians at his governor's headquarters in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the Organization of American States (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" defended by the President.
The proposed constitution places state power at the service of the economy, maintaining the right of the state to "plan development" for a country that basically lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by emigrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to disband the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again for the mandate of Head of State in February 2009.
The president has already begun to introduce this in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants, and half of the population lives below the living standard.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to Quito's and Washington's agreement to use the Ecuadorian facility as a base for US drug control measures.
19 hostages freed in Chad
Egyptian commandos raided the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad during the morning.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived by plane at the al-Maza military base around 4:30 p.m., which is directly connected to Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to speak to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, a suburb of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "not paid a ransom," Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said at the airport.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in an SUV safari.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency organizing the safari.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a special commando of 30 members arrived on two helicopters at the scene, where the hostage takers were ambushed just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the leader who asked for his name to be kept quiet.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We have to admit that we could not have achieved this without the professional and effective intervention of our Secret Service personnel and task forces,” he said.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that an SUV was intercepted while patrolling, on which the kidnappers traveled. Six of them were killed (including the Chadian leader) and two were arrested.
The army claimed that the hostage takers were associated with a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "Silent Majority" of Culture
At the heart of the news and the ongoing election campaign is the debate on the financing of culture.
We should be happy about that.
But a part of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will raise their voice to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money being used to manage small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national historical sites on the brink of starvation?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
The Constitution of our American neighbors states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec, more than 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogy work to research history and preserve a large number of private archives and archaeological artifacts with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations defend our heritage tooth and nail and protest with the last force of drowning when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states help with partial nationalisation at the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, the first European to be in trouble due to the spillover effect of the US credit market crisis: the three countries support the money and insurance institution with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Netherlands governments agreed on the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank is the first major crisis in the international financial market crisis in waves for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be regarded as a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, nearly half (49%) of the bank's assets will be acquired by all three states.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, in particular the activities purchased last year from Dutch ABN Amro, mainly insurance companies.
Fortis shares started to fall sharply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious crisis phenomena at the institute.
However, analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's records fell to a 14-year low on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market capitalisation of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the CEOs this is not realistic.
The company blamed overseas market uncertainties related to the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers rose slightly.
On Friday, a new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to lead the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a meaningful offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry about losing their money.
So far, there's been no panic among the bank's clients, no storming of the branches.
In Hungary Fortis has an independent branch and has also acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant based on people’s drug purchase data.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that always links the use of prescribing data to the consent of the person concerned.
This has to be in independent hands, otherwise we'll leave the chicken coop to the fox," said Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription program.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health status of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not take out insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacies, based on the customer's identification number, he easily obtains what drugs he has purchased in the last year and a half, and from this the program itself concludes what disease he suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol lowering, it suggests that you have virtually unmanageable levels of fat in your blood, which immediately puts you in a higher risk category.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation, some of which also define a risk multiplier, so the insurance company has little to do other than paperwork, although there are small difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, for example, some compounds can be used against migraines or heat waves, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, the former not.
Separate companies were formed to retrieve and process the data, and before they obtain the necessary information from pharmacies, they ask the patient’s consent.
They are now obliged to do so by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Recently, some companies have also processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to drug consumption data, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time it will be increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it applies only to health care providers and insurers.
Congress has before it a bill that gives the authorities control over businesses that specialize in data provision.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his programme, which would make the transfer of data conditional on the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned can hardly refuse to consent, otherwise the insurers will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the fox's benevolence.
Global Marseilles menu
India and the European Union to double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was dominated by this issue, alongside the other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear energy cooperation will be the main focus.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should have a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common understanding whether to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was not even raised at the ninth summit held in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the European Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. to EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007 has risen from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this spirit, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, i.e. air traffic may soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth in the EU's list of partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism - the latter was condemned on both sides in all its forms and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They also called for the end of the Doha trade round, although both of them are a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, which means that it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India has also agreed that a global deal should be reached at next year's climate conference and that greenhouse gas production should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also want to prevent food prices from rising and supported the convening of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he is about to make a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In Paris, they hope that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth EUR 20 billion.
According to news agencies, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse fair.
At this year’s Frankfurt International Book Fair, 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected, covering 171,790 square meters of floor space, where more than 403,000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities: Italy will occupy an exhibition area of 264 square metres through the establishment of a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Buchmesse's 5.0 pavilion, which will also provide an opportunity to present data, trends and prospects on the state of play of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in the field of adult and youth publications.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3rd, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes, Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, dispelled all remaining doubts: "After determining the position of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it is the plane on which Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared," he said in a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (NTSB) said that a few hours after the wreckage was discovered, a committee of inquiry was asked to identify the plane and determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington, Nevada on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, also in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two IDs in the name of Fosset, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was posted a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks by which he has written himself into history.
In 2002, for the sixth time, he managed to fly around the world with a balloon for the first time: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the ground without landing.
Among his many records is the flight over the Andes, at a height of 15,445 meters, carried out by a copilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
An unusual, yet original and definite form of hobbyist with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz's latest compact SUV, with which the German car company tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely because of this unconventional content that the SUV GLK launch campaign, which will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will also be surprising and unusual.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle uses an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used in Italy by a car brand.
The billboard action, which consists of three stages, will dominate Milan’s central shopping street, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of media communication will begin with a spatial presentation of the car, which will be visible in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional form with the help of special glasses distributed around the new SUV, Corso Como.
The viewer will feel as if the car is emerging from the poster.
Then, with the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, to form a unified image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Is it possible to attract the attention of prospective buyers? We’ll see.
We will show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
Trivenetian youths, they're likely to be expelled from the field.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in fact, has not been too much of a problem so far.
They never fought with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is on the right.
The main organizers are coming from Trivento.
And from Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by small sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were waved on which the fans’ hometown was marked: they were removed on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team called Levski's fans.
The Italian football association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. These were registered tickets, making it easier to check the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one who was being prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a football-related record were denied tickets and departures.
Currently, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for minutes from the Sofia police and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be banned for five years.
It is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to all stadiums in Italy, but also in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that others will join this less than 150.
“This fire must be suppressed immediately, and those who behave in this way must not be excused,” the Interior Ministry said.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's National Team Day is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
The Monitoring Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday the Committee for the Safety of Sports Events, which can count on a department of the Homeland Security Service, the secret services dealing with fan behavior.
"Duce-Duce chanting and booming arm during the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria is not a crime..."
This idea was expressed, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed head of the Ministry of Interior's observation service a few weeks ago (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and before by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazilli was previously chief of police in Trieste, the city where a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group has been operating since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to live the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of that 150-200 fans was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, he added, the first man of the observation service, but crimes must be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to look at exactly what happened and consider what to do next.
But let us also talk a little about the whistling of the Italian anthem: it is not a crime, but if I may say so, it cannot be called well-behaved..."
