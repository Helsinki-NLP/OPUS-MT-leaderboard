European inflation falls on food
Accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg statistical office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not cut the base rate, saying that the reduction, along with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is trapped in the 22nd: "to talk down" inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, inflation of 3.3% in November is a 12-year record; in Spain it rose to 4.1 from 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been driven high by rising food and energy prices.
Future wheat quotations have increased by 88 percent, and soybean prices have reached the highest level since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
Oil prices on the world market have increased by 52 percent this year, and last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5 percent in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
Analysts believe that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, it is expected that the ECB has reduced interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support has increased significantly by the beginning of December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such a low, 13 percent socialist support.
For sure party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would be more than two thirds (71 percent) against one fifth (20 percent) of MSZP's support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the total population is two percent.
Supporters of both camps are one percent more likely to vote.
The economic climate has deteriorated further to the previous low point - the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be very bad has never been this high, while another 46 percent think the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their own financial situation after the more hopeful prospects in spring and summer.
For the following year, the larger half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than any previous Gallup survey, 71 percent of those polled believed that the Prime Minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány, 13 percent of the respondents trust or trust very much, while in Viktor Orbán the proportion of supporters is 38 percent.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister at all, and 27% do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political situation is the extent to which society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While 35 percent considered it desirable for the government and the Prime Minister to remain after the riots last October, at present this ratio is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in the launch of new elections.
A typical interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of the respondents answer the question about the intention to participate, that they would definitely go, and another 20 percent say that they would probably go.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would take part in a "parliamentary election to be held this Sunday" and another 15 percent would consider their participation likely. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees, 79 percent to visit fees, and 84 percent to hospital daily allowances.
If we only look at the same proportions among those who promise to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visits and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Auchan, raised by nearly a fifth of Tesco
In the Budaörs trade triangle, hypermarkets held up last year’s average 16 percent increase in prices, with the difference that VAT did not increase this year.
The Daily Economy Article
This year, on average, the usual Christmas basket of the day increased by 16 percent in the Budaörs trade triangle, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of well over a thousand forints.
Since last December the prices in the supermarkets had already “passed away”, there was no drastic increase compared to the previous high base.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they could get under nine thousand forints last year is not available now, not even for ten thousand.
The Daily basket in the hypermarkets examined exceeded the psychological limit of HUF 10,000 by at least HUF 91.
The highest basket value was HUF 10,573.
(In 2003, the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but turkey breast fillets, nuts and poppy seeds were also very expensive.
The price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH in the shops, although we found a kilogram of bread in Auchan for 139 forints.
The competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre returnable Coca-Cola was below HUF 200, so even with a deposit fee, they only asked for HUF 257 for the product.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily Basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
Compared to last year’s Christmas prices, we calculated that Cora increased the prices in its Daily Basket by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased the prices by about 18-18 percent.
Compared to last year’s most expensive and this year’s cheapest basket value, the difference was 12%, while the increase between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive was 21%.
On average, there was an increase of 1480 in Forints.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1,206, with a VAT increase in prices last Christmas.
It was precisely this process that disrupted trade, apparently unable to decide how much margin to apply to a product, because they were unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the rate of rotation of a product is poorly designed by the trader, it can result in a significant profit on a margin adjusted for traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the price increase of the Daily Basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive was 1720 HUF more than in 2006, while the price difference was only 844 HUF more than the cheapest.
This year, this extreme did not show up, as the most expensive one was HUF 1630 more than last year, and the cheapest one was HUF 1284 more expensive.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not necessarily justify the data of the HCSO: the statistical office has increased the price of some basic foods by more than 30 percent in 12 months.
For example, in addition to flour, eggs.)
According to the Daily Basket, this seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the rather expensive product compared to the base last year produced a price increase of less than 10 percent in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the eggers, and they managed to fool the drastic price increase on the multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypers do not complain, they constantly report a good year.
In our experience, the majority of customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they carry long-term food in a flatbed.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines in front of the cashiers because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that traffic is weaker in the countryside, and more multi complains to research companies that even their plans are below revenue, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, disinfectants are saved.
This year, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds and the overload of staff are not conducive to stopping infections, according to the Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
They also save money on disinfectants in many places.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of John's Hospital.
After a serious accident, a man was found to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred earlier this year.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery has still not been performed because of the bacteria in his body.
By 10 December this year, 1094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have certainly been registered in hospitals, the rest are unknown.
About two thirds (683 infections) of infections were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried in the nose by one-third of people without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria that spreads rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
In particular, if the immune system is temporarily or permanently impaired, it may cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infection or sepsis, in patients with a weakened body, elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not tested.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients entering the hospital are already tested for MRSA in their body, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
It's not a pattern.
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current domestic hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable to prevent the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz claims.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, nursing homes, hospitals should monitor incoming patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these studies.
Most cases will come to light if the patient has a detectable MRSA infection, said the head of department at the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always comply with this.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Saving on Disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted from one patient to another by medical staff.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, but in domestic hospital conditions it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
In fact, wards are often crowded, often very close to each other, even though from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, it can also be seen, Karolina Böröcz noted, that hospitals in unfavorable financial situations save on disinfectants, few nurses, many patients, so there is an even greater chance of developing infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, there are fewer such infections or the spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, so they are fighting it everywhere.
In England, for example, it included the prevention and reduction of MRSA in the government programme.
The programme appears to be successful, with MRSA infections showing a downward trend in England based on the data reported.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) is the prevention of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
Police officer not drunk after fatal accident
The official expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the police captain of the XXII district has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that he would have been driving drunk or intoxicated in the meantime, the police captain of the XXII district, who hit a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, said Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Budapest Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the expert opinion on this was completed.
The expert opinion supported the primary test result, which has already established that the former police captain did not drink alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
On Tuesday, the then head of the XXII district precinct hit the 55-year-old man who did not want to get across the street at the designated pedestrian crossing point in his own car on Kossuth Lajos Street in the XXII district.
(The latter, i.e. that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not otherwise a mitigating circumstance under the rules of the KRESZ, the turning driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police chief resigned and asked to be retired, according to the police, because he was so shaken by the incident.
The investigation is being conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police captain had cooperated with the prosecutors carrying out the investigation from the beginning.
Another 400 million euros in infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three credit line agreements worth a total of EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a budget of EUR 300 million in 2006 for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which 100 million loans have already been concluded by the parties, the contract now signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also provides budgetary financing for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million, which is primarily used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, Metro 4 was also mentioned.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this can take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans is granted by the EIB with a grace period of 8 years and without a maintenance commission linked to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all of Europe's attention is focused on the previously mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU’s still cheapest but fast-growing market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate shopping destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beachfront houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, and on the beach Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
Analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria say that sooner or later the central part of the country will attract investors – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – and more and more people will buy around the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return on investment.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf havens in Europe, making it a top destination for the other two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
For this reason, forward-thinking investors are already making large purchases, such as in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and ski resorts.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy renovated properties for between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand, or old houses for EUR 5 to EUR 15 thousand, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, it is important for them to be close to a big city, shops and usually the local doctor.
The second category belongs to holiday buyers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of business investors who buy in the hope of increasing their value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is constantly increasing, as the demand is increasing.
Bulgaria has the lowest property prices in the European Union, but it has grown by 21% a year over the last five years.
The rise in house prices is substantially higher than the rise in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol to 2012.
At present, there is a heated debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently wish to discuss precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to a 25-40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether developed countries will undertake to provide both financial and technological assistance to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
Agreements have also been reached on aid to developing countries.
The fund, which is part of the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, which is expected to be part of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF).
6% of Hungary
Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's ambition to preserve its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "post-2012 agreement" and is ready to undertake a reduction of up to 30 percent if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to take on commitments corresponding to their responsibilities and abilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol set a total reduction of 5.2%, including the EU - then 15 of its Member States - of minus 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1985-87 period, which our country will meet. – recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes are high in Bali, as the long-term international climate agreement must be reached within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be moved after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, the need for which was pointed out by the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize winner, international scientific body on climate change, in its latest report.
This would result in a delay in reducing emissions and the inevitability of an increase in the Earth's average temperature above 2 degrees Celcius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
The British army units will publish recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on video-sharing to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) was the first to receive YouTube: special forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These miniature, helmet-mounted cameras are checked at the Air Force Operations Command in Kandahar and then sent to London, where the Hungarians upload them to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
139 recordings of Air Force soldiers have already been uploaded to the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes videos of both operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally intended to post the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also a good way to make the public aware of the true purpose of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment commercials, said Gordon Mackenzie, defense expert to the BBC, but it inevitably carries some political message as it proves the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans played a game.
The army also has a problem with the fact that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are added to the share, which, for example, show the death of soldiers: in slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses at most, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
A number of videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan have already been posted on the Internet, but the British army has only recently caught it.
The Americans recruit a little differently, with the free download of America's Army shooting game, in which the player can become a soldier in a more or less realistic simulation.
Christmas and Christmas at the Ministries
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a year-end workshop for her colleagues, who will be able to say goodbye to her with scones and coffee from 2007.
There is a ministry where there will be a live music party, and elsewhere they will bring a Christmas atmosphere into the hearts of officials with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - this is how the power amuses.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Ministry Christmas party this year will be held by the Defence Ministry, but HM is not waiting for Ministry workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts, and on the Christmas of the Mission they host the family of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions, but they also host a press reception.
The wallet will spend $25 million on the end of the year mood.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are off the hook compared to other wallets.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total of HUF 4 320 000 and about three hundred and fifty guests from the 600 ministerial employees.
At the ceremony of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas mood, but there will be performers and raffles.
The NFÜ's Christmas cost HUF 4 700 000, and it was held in the building of the National Council for the Judiciary (OIT) on Wednesday - there were concerts and dinners.
The room rental cost one million forints, the remaining part was spent on more than 400 guests.
We know that one department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration: it is organized by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
The building of the Comedy Theatre was rented for the purpose.
The information has not been confirmed at MAG Zrt., as we have not been able to reach the competent person.
I don't need a suit
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held a Luca Day ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He did not ask them for money for the use of the OIT rooms.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's toast, and after dinner, you could dance to live music.
To the question of the [origo], it was said that the evening dress or suit was not mandatory at all at the ball.
The health, labour and municipal wallets are set up for a Puritan party.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and ceremony for the employees in its own building for HUF 400 000.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth, on the other hand, is not officially waiting for a Christmas party, but for a year-end workshop.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected, who, said the press department, will only receive coffee and scones, so the party will be brought out of 350 000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply toast with his colleagues in the lobby of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas meeting in its own main hall, for which 436 employees are expected.
2,500 HUF per guest for the Christmas party - the amount includes a buffet reception and a toast.
Since János Veres has been the minister, PM employees have been having a similar Christmas every year.
There will be no party mood, however, and the officiality will be strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Ministry of Agriculture will give a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry's Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception will be held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Park, and according to the wallet, the 100 guests will receive HUF 1000 per person.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, for which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial toast and end with a restrained snack.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - they told the [origo] in the relevant press departments.
They couldn't tell the price of the environmental wallet's office Christmas in the press department.
In any case, more than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Applied Arts.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering.
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law - the work stoppage will begin.
The action will certainly cause a significant disruption in transport, as rail transport will stop almost completely and they will also strike at BKV until 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, he will present the details of the Monday strike organised by the League Trade Unions together with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, and from Monday the organisations joining the strike will stop working indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike started was not indicated on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the health insurance law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide to continue.
On the basis of the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the health insurance law will only be voted on in the late evening or perhaps at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant disruptions can be expected in transport: work at the railways will be stopped for an indefinite period, and in the morning some of Budapest's public transport, more than half of the Volán companies, may stop.
At the same time, there will be a half-track roadblock in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's home page.
Some organisations have announced strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others have announced temporary work cessations.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on sufficient services, even though more and more people travel by rail as Christmas holidays approach.
According to the previous announcements, they are on strike at BKV, Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and a four-hour strike is being held by LIGA Electric and Heat Energy Trade Unions, 2 and 2-8 hours of work was called for by the Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association is on strike at national times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers in the Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and put a new concept to social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce a new form of pension calculation due from next year.
The third is to ensure the possibility of entering the system for worthy jobs even before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) of the League of Trade Unions does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport for railway wing lines.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Raises Country’s Risk
Founded in August this year with the support of Jobbik Hungary Movement, the activities of the Hungarian Guard increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital.
In its "risk warning", the company wrote that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "with the escalation of ethnic tensions already existing between the Hungarian Gypsy and non-Gypsy population, violent ethnic clashes may develop in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to be aimed at provoking such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: "public discussion of Roma affairs has been handed over by public actors to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "significantly worsened the image of Hungary abroad, mainly in terms of faith in the stability and democratic development of the country".
It is recalled that from the autumn of 2006, it has gained increasing publicity and momentum as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups in Hungary, as from the summer of 2007 several organisations calling themselves "national self-defence" associations were formed in Hungary.
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as NGOs, while openly promoting the preparation of their members – even armed ones – for defence (disaster protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, and also on the grounds of the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state,” they added.
They noted that this is done in accordance with the method of putting various political aspirations in a civil guise based on the anti-political and anti-partisanism of society.
Thus, the emphasis on civility and the form of association are not only used to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration in the case of these associations, but also as a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased for the region as a whole.
For example, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
BNU used this to decide on the formation of the guard, saying that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defense".
In the last 17 years, Bulgaria has experienced a “gypsy terror”, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative provoked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they wrote, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is indicated by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they will set up their own guard as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities with the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Roma in Hungary will respond to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, reads the risk warning of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
He said they would publish their risk analysis annually, and if they experienced anything that could affect the change in risk, they would inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It’s not a red letter everywhere.
In Hungary, the law accurately marks the red-letter days, and around the holidays the day shift has become a common practice, of which there will be less next year.
There is no uniform celebration in the EU or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are mostly linked to church holidays and outstanding historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year are both public holidays - the latter just so that New Year's Evers can rest.
There are 11 red-letter holidays throughout the year.
National holiday is also the 15th of March and 23rd of October, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848.
On 20 August we celebrate the founding of the state, on 1 May we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two days of Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national, or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become a practice to relocate working days in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the price of extended weekends is that we do not stay away from work and school on the previous Saturdays.
The exact date of the day immediately before or after the holiday has been regulated by the Minister of Labour for many years in a separate decree.
The legislation covers all employers and the workers they employ, civil servants and those in a public service relationship.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays as a result of its intended purpose.
This year, the work schedule will only change around the end of the year: from December 24th, life will almost stop in the country, as experience has shown that the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slipped" by the majority of people or use their savings for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle of the week or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer work shifts than this year.
First, the calendar is transformed around the celebration of work, so that the workers can stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day in exchange for Friday 2 May.
The other relocation is related to the holiday of 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, it will be necessary to work instead of the 24th of Friday.
However, the end of the year can be fully in the spirit of the holiday next year, as from December 24 there will be a non-stop break almost everywhere, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 things to do to annoy your colleagues
Emails we forget to send, voice mails we never get, innocent lies we hardly notice anymore: they “color” the day-to-day at work.
The question is whether you get used to small inconveniences or pick up the gloves and consciously avoid ambiguous situations that annoy others.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that I got a call from the marketing department," one of your colleagues says.
That you missed a meeting because of this?
At best, he regrets and tries to make things right, perhaps calling the marketing department to tell you that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before making an embarrassing apology, it is worth considering what it is that can make your colleagues uncomfortable and consciously strive to avoid it.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Do you remember yesterday when you put your stapler on the table, but it got up in the morning?
Perhaps you'll discover your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking, because they are right to be angry with you for stealing their property.
Don’t pocket office envelopes or post-its, as they can be unpleasant if they run out early and you need them immediately.
You're gossiping about your colleagues' private lives?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that are already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t tie your information about your colleagues’ private lives to everyone’s noses.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Bury what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your coworkers in absentia, even if others know what your colleague is wearing.
You're calling in sick for no reason?
When you call the office and report a sick person because of a splitting headache because you feel unwell or feel like you would rather rest that day, remember that your work, your urgent tasks, your futures work must be done by someone else for you.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you will not go to the office the next day, or that something may happen that will make you stay at home, indicate that your colleagues and boss should not face your absence the next day.
Humping, giggling, making phone calls
You've gone into work, but you're being pulled out of it by the giggles of colleagues?
Have you become an unwitting listener to a phone call that would have been better not to hear?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, talking loudly (which you carry over their heads), or by beating their feet, constantly swearing, or being loudly dissatisfied.
These can all be confusing, even if they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame others for your mistakes?
If something is not timed, you forgot to send an important letter, a message, and don't blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Do not refer to the chaos that may prevail in the office, your loud colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and someone else is at a disadvantage, and eliminate the damage.
Ask how you can make up for your mistake.
Do you feel at home in the office?
Bear pants and slippers: comfortable to wear at home, but not in the office!
Don’t wear comfortable clothes even if your job allows it.
Don’t be sloppy and respect yourself by going into the office in ordinary clothes, if your job requires it, neatly and elegantly.
If you want to meet me, you're not interesting anymore.
Grab a car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio there is a special melody: the sound of the violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll turn up the volume.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives next to the previous sounds, and then a female choir joins as a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love is playing on mr2.
For a long time, the Hungarian music life did not spoil us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it looks like it's a different jam if you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground, slowly change the overall picture, and even though guitar threshing garage rock is fashionable again, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi's orchestra until, perhaps because two hornets couldn't fit in a barn, he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance music, pop, he began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Török Ferenc Season).
His formations, which initially played in smaller clubs, were known by a wider audience when wan2 magazine classified their first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important Hungarian albums, and Zagar, in the company of Yonderboi, declared almost the only Hungarian trendmakers who appeared to be marketable in the West.
Undoubtedly, Zagar and his band became "trendy", but of course no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band responded as it should: he made a new, better album.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open up new ways for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the early years of Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer's old orchestra there.
With the airy, flying reference, we would be on the spot, but besides the airiness of music, the effect of the louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the age, has now appeared.
In these songs, at the premiere of the album in Millenáris, György Ligeti, a singer currently working with The Puzzle band in England, presented himself.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and Mr2 Petőfi, who recently played popular music from morning to evening, began to smuggle into the ears the grand melodies of Wings of Love recorded with the six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how much layer music is left to play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of popular music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative, underground music can be flat, meaningless, and just as ready to be sold, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can come from an honest motivation.
The attitude of the host also operates in this spirit regardless of language and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences towards your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has greater traditions.
Not only the 12-year-olds go to concerts there, but also the older ones.
Rather, they monitor the changes in popular music around them, because they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
JW: What is the role of the public in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
B.Z.: Of course it feels good that more and more people are attending our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not made for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is more noticeable at concerts, where there is already an impact on each other, but this lies only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I've noticed that if you want to meet the audience, you're not interesting anymore.
Q. How far do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works solo, and he built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don’t really go his way, even though sometimes they try to explain it in our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other person's musical presence and lets it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi's music, as many of us left his band and started another way.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on the top list of mr2 Petőfi.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Have you consciously opened up to a wider range of people with a more popular style?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and then sell the album.
This song is about more.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, which was to try to resolve the vocal orgy and the more difficult topics that had been committed on the album.
Q. How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came to assemble this choir from the well-sounded soloists of our own domestic music scene.
This is how the six-member choir - Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Németh Juci - was assembled, which was then called Underground Divas.
Q. Is this the way the song was designed or created?
Zs.B.: The number existed in instrumental version for a long time, and then when the record came together, we thought we needed something else for this song.
He was attracted to the chord procession to get a voice on him.
That same night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost spontaneous at first.
I remember it was very exciting at the time, but of course it took the Belles.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short solo), there is no role of their own, they sing together completely and are no louder than music, so music does not just accompany their singing.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Z.: The fact that they were in the back was purely due to technical problems.
However, we are aware that we did not want to share solo roles.
That's what my mouth is about, to forget a little bit about who came from, where they're going, just to let those wings, those wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
Q. Which one did you do the most work with?
Zs.B.: In fact, there were heavier pieces than mixing with none of them in the musical creative process.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a tournament piano, or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't work for a long time, and then slowly everything came into place like a puzzle game.
Q. What is your favorite song from the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I've already "let go" of the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Traitor Broker Risked Billions Because of Feeling Underprivileged
Infidel embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not untalented at all, was more of a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he recognized the crisis of the American mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally retarded," said his superiors who informed the police.
However, as reported by Le Monde in France, Kerviel’s testimony shows that at the end of last year, he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his business.
Crisis not only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his testimony.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the American crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were rumors that there would be problems with subprime mortgages for customers with low incomes or past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that, and he put on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profit reached EUR 1.6 billion.
“When I made the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel admits, adding that he didn’t keep anything to himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he forged his reports in such a way that they could not be revealed.
He also managed to trick his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his transactions.
The risk was a gain.
Were you afraid that everything would come out?
I'd rather not.
“I thought that just the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would reassure them.”
Where did he get the willpower to risk so much?
He reached his position gradually.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale since 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and became an independent broker in 2005 with a salary of $90,000 a year.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005, I knew from my first conversation that they were looking at me with a bad eye.
Because of my education, professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
Shortly after his entry, the first great success came.
Allianz made a profit thanks to its shares, as it was betting half a billion euros on the fall of these shares during the London bombings.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But his bosses said they knew everything, or rather suspected it.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
One weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he left for work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
“I’ve only taken four days in the last year.
A broker who has no freedom is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to have a look at their reports,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic to win 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government, together with representatives of the European Commission, have signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion kroner) in the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
About 125 billion kroner will be spent in the regions out of seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is directed to transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operating program and represents 22 percent of the assets available from the funds for the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state fund of Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion kroner next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to win assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in obtaining funding from EU funds so far.
Former Nicaraguan President Sentenced to 20 Years in Prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday approved a 20-year prison sentence for Arnold Aleman, the former president of the country, for which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud worth $100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital city.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be returned to prison is not yet clear, according to the AP news agency.
Ileana Perez, president of the Court of Appeals, said it would be up to the prison administration to decide whether to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government funds to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
In reality, these fictitious companies and their account numbers belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of these funds then ended up with a foundation, which Alemán founded to finance his 2001 election campaign.
Our budget has been approved.
That's right.
The state budget has been approved.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, adopted by a coalition majority, without the support of the opposition.
This was passed last year with the support of the Social Democrats, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not allow it to be accepted.
Unlike the debate on distrust of the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives passed this generally ignored, although most influential law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of the powers of the government and the opposition.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why it gets much more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the social democratic governments of the past have had three shortcomings that the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of these is the high proportion of the mandatory, so-called payer spending law, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year by the silent "coalition" of . .SSD and KS.M. before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a result of the first deficiency.
The third limit is the deficits of public funding, i.e. the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively controlled.
Time bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and districts.
Many mayors can raise money for investments other than taxes, levies and bank loans, and they often issue bonds with which their city halls are disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the mass sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
They don't have that source anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we determine that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase for a few years, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries, with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more rationally than the Czech Republic.
This is a huge shame for the previous governments.
We belong to the countries that are least at risk of poverty by global standards.
There is therefore no need, for example, for huge social programmes, which, unfortunately, have become gigantic in recent years.
Although this year we managed to eliminate the part of the meaningless populist spending approved before the elections, even if the border of retirement and pension reform will not be extended in the near future, any policy in this country will actually end, and whoever governs, it will be just officialism.
With a little exaggeration, most of the taxed money from governing politicians usually becomes pensioners and mechanical distributors of social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the crowding out of normal expenditure by expenditure on the payer.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not wasted everything they have been able to do in the last decade.
If we do not want to see mere officials become governors, we must be patient and wish peace of mind in the preparation of further reform laws for this not-too-strong coalition government, aware that the state can only issue what it can get from taxes and levies.
Only these will allow a balanced budget to be reached gradually.
Jisí Krejsí
Banks want to solve the crisis.
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis of financial markets.
The financial markets are thus subject to more than a hundred billion dollars through the stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, the interest rate is increased on the bank, for which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the US Fed will put $40 billion on the stock exchange and make another 24 available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time since the September 11 attacks, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This move should solve some of the biggest problems in the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, a consultant for Economic Outlook Group, wrote in the report.
“Coordinated action by central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of a recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in the United States mainly because of unpaid loans.
Analysts expect further losses of billions.
“Central banks can really be afraid of what could happen next if they decide to do so,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
It seems to be really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if the banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce demand and plunge the US economy into recession with possible consequences for global economic growth.
Central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank supply rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain had reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
“This will have a similar effect to the further interest rate drop,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will help to avert the crisis, as it will not solve the basic problem, the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is the biggest threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticized the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
His book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, said that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is made up of a special mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
"The debate there is absolutely without structure, it's just throwing words, which are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that he was very important to his subject, which is why he is so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book was also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only cartoons of my opinion".
Now, therefore, those interested can read his undistorted opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, in his opinion he had sufficient basis to write such a book.
Since he is able to monitor and evaluate professional studies as an academic, he is also experienced in statistics and economists.
In conclusion, he indicated that the climate is constantly changing, that is, its changes are normal, and that all scientists do not agree on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, so that they do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
In addition, as a person with experience in totalitarianism, he considers the imposition of unproven opinions unacceptable, which he perceives as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that "it is not against reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke about a similar topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
More than 600,000 people were unable to change their driving licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old driver's license in time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for a replacement so that the offices can issue a new driver's license in time for the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, 100,000 drivers will leave without valid entitlement.
According to the authorities, the driver's license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the districts represent a sharp drop in interest in driver’s license exchanges, the capital’s offices were flooded with applications for driver’s license exchanges, for which interest has increased this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
You have to stand in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, the driver's license has not yet been replaced by about 140,000 drivers.
A new driver’s license is issued for 20 days.
However, you can also apply for a new driving licence with a shortened time limit of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to carry out the mandatory change of driving licence by the end of the year and who start with an invalid licence will be penalised from January.
The guilty must pay a maximum of two thousand kroner.
However, the police may also settle the offence by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
According to previous information from City Hall, you can also get a fine if you don't travel anywhere.
Supposedly, you can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
Earlier, the Ministry called on the offices to be lenient and to impose fines of up to a thousand crowns.
However, according to Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
A driver's license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an identity card that must be valid for everyone.
People who don't want to drive should give up their license.
It is enough to take it or send it to the appropriate office by post.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid.
However, drivers should gradually replace other types of driving licenses.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 may replace them for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court lowers sentence for Berdycchel co-investigators
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kozacík, suspected of colluding with David Berdych's criminal organization, were sentenced to thirteen and ten years in prison.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court with final effect, which thus reduced their sentences by one year and two years for the other.
The investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally threatened with 14 and 12 years in prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, a review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdyche is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first-degree judgment.
In other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found 19 people guilty of robbery, 16 of which were appealed by the Supreme Court today.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation by saying it was a speculative case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, after the agreement with Berdyc, members of the police provided criminals with information from police sources, covered for individual robbery and helped the gang avoid criminal liability.
The gang therefore handed over 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Kosacík.
The indictment is about the gang's crimes between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, these are robberies whose victims have often suffered serious damage to health, but also abuse of the powers of a civil servant and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because the police found illegal pistols, steel core bullets, laser sightings, or machine guns in search of houses.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
The gang of less than 20 members has already been recognised by the courts as legally guilty of Berdych's other robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment are testifying before the court in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
The first-instance trial has so far avoided Tomás Puta and Maros ?ulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Invoice for child exchange: 12 million
For the children traded in obstetrics, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, demands 12 million crowns of pain and court expenses from the hospital in T
Three million for mothers, two million for fathers, and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond.ej Dostál Veleba, fundamentally disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject such a claim because it's too much," Dostal said after today's trial.
"To be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
Find out if it has any usable value.
But we maintain that it will be measured in hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 K.
At the beginning of the case, the family of Jablosov wanted a million crowns for every month they didn't raise their own biological daughter.
Veleba was the subject of expert criticism on the basis of the compensation negotiations, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress of varying degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even if they were so reproached that they did not prevent the replacement of the newborn.
Women are coping worse with the actuality of the trauma and what is happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the maternity ward in T.ebí.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola .ermákék in P. . . . . P. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
At the end of October, the district manager of Vysosina, Milos Vystr?il, handed over 100,000 kroner to families to replace their expenses, which were caused by the fault of the hospital in T?ebí?ské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance under the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach into the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they may ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have approved relatively low compensation for people, calculated on the basis of tables of a few hundred thousand, in exceptional cases a few million crowns.
Polívka lost his kingdom in Valasko
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit for the title of the Kingdom of Vala asko.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name King of Valach, the project was developed by a team around Tomá
Polivka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about Mr. Harabic and his team abusing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Valachi Kingdom remind everyone of the actor-comic.
This opinion is shared by Harabi.
“There’s almost ten years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing actions,” he said.
He thinks the cause of the dispute is money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and they could gain something from it.
They want to live off our work,” he added.
Profitable business
According to the court, the name King Valach was first used in Polívka's television show.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobotha was crowned.
At the time, however, this was not related to the goal of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabic came up with the idea of issuing passports in Valach.
The original student prank action turned into a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabic then based the creation of a society of the Kingdom of Valasko.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also mentioned today that Harabic used the idea himself, which Polívka published in the manes for his business.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity on the Valachi kingdom project certainly helped," the judge said.
However, he added that the heart of the project was the intensively engaged Harabi- and his team.
The cooperation of the now quarreled parties continued until 2000, when Harabis organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabi, which have resulted in the exoneration of "King Boleslav I, who has been elected forever".
At the initiative of Harabi. Jarmila .ulaková took the lead in the kingdom as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a court action against Harabi and Others, which was rejected by the court today.
Light into the debate could be brought by the battle planned by Harabi a for the throne and half for the princess.
There should be a new king out of this fight.
He didn't want to give me the details and the time.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It's supposed to be something like the King's March of Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a definite period of time.
Mr. Polívka can also apply," added Harabi.
The test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: disappearing prejudices
I never really liked the Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the thread are nothing special, the quality of the change, driving and production can often be marked as below average.
But the successor to the Peugeot 207, which is already on the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called SW goes another step further, so for me, there's nothing left but to think more.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained about the space left to the head in the back seat.
This time, the complaint is over, as the body of the station wagon means that the two-metre tall giants are no longer suffering in this regard.
Fast in the world
I'll get through the interior soon so I don't repeat myself a lot.
It's a relatively good design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
I'd appreciate a little more designer inspiration here, since the car's appearance is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or armrests.
Lateral driving has also improved significantly compared to the 206 model.
As far as space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the body.
After that, the little space of the head mentioned in the station wagon disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main thing in this vehicle is the luggage compartment.
This should be considered very accessible (also thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tires, which are ideal compromises.
They're out of the way, they can be pulled apart and they can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to volume for a while.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most sought-after vehicle of this class - Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW with the product of the new generation in Mladá Boleslav, then we find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 liters.
For a foreign holiday or the placement of a stroller, this value is almost critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backrests of the second row are folded down or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The car we tested was equipped with a 1.6 l four-cylinder, foreign-ignition engine with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the $1,600 should look like that drives the family hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption and it pulls first.
If we compare it to the equivalent of Skoda, which often acts as if a rag has been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
Whispering the price
The price of the car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we have tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car with a four-cylinder foreign engine will still go for 329 900 K.
The car starts from 410 990 K., which is already quite a lot.
The tested Premium equipment throws an additional 80,000 K.
But we also had head airbags, automatic climate, automatic wiper start-up, back windows with electrical remote control.
That is, the car costs 531 900 K.
That's a lot, but count the Fabia's additional equipment, and you'll get a very similar result.
All that remains is a decision for the brand.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools has failed
There are an increasing number of Eastern European children in British schools, which raises concerns about the further development of local schooling.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between immigrants and children of domestic residents have turned into violence.
The problems related to the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in northern Kent, where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensifying.
The quarrels and quarrels between students already characterize the relationships of parents.
The situation got to the point where in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends himself by insulting him with racist curses.
The police also had to act after two 12-year-old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls allegedly scolded the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"As we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he hit us with apples and pears and then revealed his naked ass," the mother of the Slovak students wrote to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One local resident classified the debates on immigrants in Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 Slovaks are registered looking for work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be fulfilled if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a fish pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean Islands, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
On an island, however, you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
During the Spanish, Cuba was a bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a treasure warehouse and a transshipment site that the Spaniards robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the bosses of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (primarily prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among the guests were
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Towers were built in Havana, and cars became a cult symbol of the 50s of the last century on the wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojímar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of American show business.
And today?
You can also sign the Bodeguita wall in Havana.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional Hotel, they'll make you a cocktail as you wish.
And the cult cars of the '50s are still running in Havana, as your once exported visguli and your son have long rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana has been significantly destroyed, there are no more beautiful colonial monuments in the area than there are there.
Other places are getting nicer, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides the money so much needed, its development has been given the green light.
In the last fifteen years, not only have new hotels been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique delicacy in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, sugar cane was transported to sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines operating there, whose contemporaries can only be seen in museums elsewhere.
Which way should we go?
Most of the best known places in Cuba are not avoided.
So there's no need to write too much about Varader or Havana.
Perhaps we should just remind you that there is a museum on the already mentioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss a visit to this museum.
The Visales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from limestone.
Lime formations, lime cones and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has accumulated in their cavities, thanks to which the broken cliffs are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
Its final form can be found when visiting a cigar factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish island colonization.
Fame and glory were brought by the slave and sugar trade.
The economy was embodied in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-big city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Trinidad between the Escambray plain and the sea is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads connecting this region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't tear it down, and everyone was happy to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon in Trinidad, it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of Sugar Factory.
In the evening, it is appropriate to go to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after dark, where the music will only be quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the eastern part of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and divided mountains, passing through a nature barely affected by human activity.
Thanks to the untouched nature of Cuba's eastern land language, UNESCO has added it to the World Heritage List.
Here is the best chocolate, the church has a Columbus cross (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus' sailing) and from the hill where the former castle stood and today stands the El Castillo hotel, some of the tablet mountains can be seen, the best known of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Meastro plain, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion, which is believed by the descendants of former slaves, can be written a lot about all this.
As they say, it’s better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans
Few soldiers and lack of the necessary equipment influence the course of the United States mission in Afghanistan.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, who have units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries are also discussing further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, with the help of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called for more activity by NATO troops this week, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and the strengthening of development assistance as a priority.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to launch the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is the strongest in the last five years, according to the U.S. government.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter in the south.
According to the United States, however, the Allies also reached their borders in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were requested to train Afghan troops.
“We need to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
The same spirit was expressed today by Jaap de Hoop, Secretary General of NATO.
“I’m not happy about what’s on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of a three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there have also been debates among the participating countries on whether all allies are providing the maximum in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas with the least violence and combat requirements, so they are not as high as they are against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan loafers have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a British team's rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt to reach one trillion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, there are 84,000 kroner public debt.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the state budget.
The public debt of the Czech Republic reached 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
During the nine months of this year, this has increased by 40.2 billion kroner.
From June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion kroner.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its public debt figures from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 kroner in debt.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 billion kroner.
“For now, it looks like next year’s lower deficit will only allow us to exceed the one trillion crown limit in 2009.
Next year, the debt will be around 900 billion and a trillion kroner,” Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, the analyst of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, sees this: "In the course of 2009, we can cross a trillion.
The exact time depends on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it were proven that the situation in the field of politics would change, politicians would be willing to save more, and this could be shifted until 2010.
But I don't suppose that's a change," he said.
Growing Debts
Public debt consists of the debts of the central government, which is formed primarily by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Public debt is financed by cash certificates, government loan bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
So far this year, the state's internal indebtedness has increased by 38,5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
So far, the state's foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called marketable public debt reached 803.3 billion kroner by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kroner from June.
The average maturity of government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“Full-year debt increased by 13% in the first quarter, which is quite a lot compared to the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20%.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here,” Pikora commented on the data.
Better than Expected
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to better development of the state budget.
The budget deficit is likely to reach 76 billion kroner this year, instead of the supposed 91.3 billion kroner.
In addition, the Czech Consolidation Agency has planned a maximum source of 13.3 billion kroner, a reserve of ten billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner for the financing of government bonds and 1.8 billion kroner for the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher appears today in a court of Khartoum because of the name given to a teddy bear
A court in Khartoum on Thursday night sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country for violating Islam, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing her six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad. However, Islam prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, who is a teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. Under Section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, she was accused of violating Islam and rebelling after the parents of the students complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education several times.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's teddy bear.
“The children suggested a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said the school’s principal, Robert Boulos.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children voted under the first name Muhammad.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a common diary with the bear's photo and "My name is Muhammad."
The problem is that any depiction of the prophet is a violation of Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a Muslim colleague who taught at the same school, said that she knew him well and that the teacher would never do anything that would violate any religious belief. According to her, it was just an "innocent mistake": "I'm only sorry that she had the children vote for the name."
Many of the teacher's students agree with this opinion. They believe that the teacher is "very good with children" and "never talks about religion in class".
Remember that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of expressing respect for the prophet. (This name is often given to the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of a first name?
Can you name it a game?
This is obviously a matter of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last Vienna meeting on Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
The sixth and final meeting between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the separatist province ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not reached an agreement on status,” EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
U.S. Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There is no need to be afraid of violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult period," he added, stressing the existence of "obvious tensions."
The broadcast ends on December 10.
On Monday, Serbia and Kosovo will be visited for the last time by an intermediary troika including the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian province may be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Bocan-Harchenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, was the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN entrusted the troika with another mediation in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation task will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already thwarted Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, are insisting that negotiations continue after the deadline.
“Russia was and will remain committed to a negotiated solution, to a compromise,” Bocan-Harchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years under the control of the UN, the Western powers believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said she was ready to unilaterally declare her independence if the Security Council did not decide in her favor.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, we have failed to reach an agreement,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo’s independent province, at the hotel in Baden, where “negotiations of last chance” have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo uprising and future prime minister of the province, also expressed regret.
However, he added that Belgrade’s vision of autonomy would be “a continuation of the past that has led to murders and deportations”.
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that a compromise was still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of a "domino effect" in an unstable region due to the independence wars of the 1990s.
“For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise,” Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has veto rights.
Kosovo’s parliament will have the final say.
“For Serbia, only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“The negotiations lasted two years.
They have to end where they started: in the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians is based on "conciliation" with Western powers.
Bush calls for a deal between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced Tuesday at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas have agreed to immediately negotiate a final settlement of the 60-year dispute between their peoples.
In the presence of the two presidents, Bush promised to support them in every way possible to sign the "Peace Treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians will have to dismantle “terrorist networks” and Israel will have to abandon its colonial activities, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their obligations to the “Peace Roadmap” adopted in 2003.
The White House said the talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel were aimed at “signing a peace treaty to resolve all outstanding issues, including central issues.”
The latter concern three sensitive issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who lived on the territory of today's Israeli state.
Abbas, who spoke after the US president, insisted that future negotiations should be "global and in-depth" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security".
Then Olmert, who entered the platform, promised that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous", and he would strive for them to be "completed in 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush had set the "vision of two states" for the Palestinian and Israeli side by side.
Saudi Arabia said it had received a promise from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was considered a success by Washington, with the support of all Arab countries, initiated a plan to guarantee peace to Israel in exchange for withdrawing from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis “is a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues,” the Saudi prince said in an interview with the Saudi-owned Arab daily.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual for this kind of news, the official position and the rumor contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the National Police General Inspection Office (IGPN), a police car was on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 5 p.m.
"The car was patrolling, so it wasn't in action. It was traveling at a speed of 40-50 km/h without sirens," we learned from police sources.
The two helmetless young men were driving at "high speed" with a green, "not registered in the official register, so it cannot be used in road traffic" (see below) Kawasaki brand engine.
"Because they didn't follow the right-hand rule, the engine crashed into the left side of the police car," says one police officer.
The result of the alcohol test on the passengers of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the collision that the front of the car was dented, the windshield cracked in star form, and the bumper fell off.
Pontoise’s attorney general, Marie-Thér?se de Givry, said in a special announcement yesterday morning that he had entrusted IGPN and the Val-D’Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation, which was launched “due to a failure to commit negligent manslaughter and assistance.”
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police can be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, three witnesses to the accident interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, from a strip that was undoubtedly drawn by the footrests on the road, it was shown that the two vehicles were stuck together and were moving together for a while until the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized for the purpose of roadworthiness testing.
The bodies of the two victims were examined by a medical examiner yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Rumor spread yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel that the police left the scene quickly without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but it excludes the police from making "any serious mistake".
"This is the most difficult part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and in doing so, extra caution," police sources said.
The Libération met with an eyewitness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment overlooks the exact location.
“My cousin, who is a hospital nurse, and I immediately went down to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to resuscitate one of the young people, and the fourth one called."
The tension among those present increased as the hopeless situation of the two young people became apparent, so the incoming police carried their colleagues away by car.
We also know from the witness' statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They used a heart massage, but it didn't work.
“I wouldn’t say the police didn’t try to help the young people.
The young people got help.
Firefighters immediately arrived at the scene.
They did everything they could to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
On Monday, Pakistani police blocked the first demonstrations after the state of emergency introduced by General Musharraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the eastern part of the country, in the city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures imposed during the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were appointed.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked the lawyers and wounded them.
More people were produced.
In Islamabad, registered lawyers from the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced protests over the weekend arrests of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed to prevent assembly.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and Peshawar in the central part of the country.
Since Monday, the lawyers' movement has been supported by the vast Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. Its leader "encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who took an oath in front of Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the Court will have to declare the legality of President Musharraf's re-election by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced by another.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to Supreme Court rulings,” he told The News.
President Pervez Musharraf’s promise to leave the army to take the role of civilian president has “lost its validity” after the introduction of the state of emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, announced on Monday.
Musarraf had to part with the military uniform until 15 November, the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government has also denied the nationwide rumor that President Musharraf would have been assigned a forced residence by his deputy general.
More than a third of pregnancies are unplanned
This result includes unwanted (24%) and unplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
More than a third (36%) of pregnancies are still unplanned, according to a study by the French National Institute of Demography (Ined) 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act liberalizing contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) and unplanned or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as the pill or the bee spiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between the ages of 20 and 44 took birth control pills in 1970, but today this ratio is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
One in five plans to be precise for a few months, and if possible, for spring, as this is the most favorable season for the reception of the child.
Spectacular improvements to the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of the torn solar panel essential to the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space walk proved to be a record in several ways: the repair took a very long time, there was very little time to design it, and it had to be done away from the housing modules with tools "made" by astronauts.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a giant cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to laboratory modules.
However, their power supply must be ensured.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move one of the modules producing electricity with the help of 17,5 tonnes of solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to its final place.
Then the crew began to open the module’s 76-metre wide solar panels.
This is when one of the harmonica foldable boards was damaged by a stuck cable of about 1 metre in length.
In order to avoid further damage, the table was not opened.
Astronauts were originally tasked with taking a tour of the Discovery shuttle and then repairing another solar panel with a faulty rotation system. Instead, they had to devote their entire time to repairing the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging on the 30-metre robot arm attached to the station crane.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
Tall, strong, extremely skillful, muscular upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old man had to “operate” the “damaged” solar panel.
After thoroughly assessing the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "rails".
He was assisted by another "spacewalker" who stayed close to the safe passage, as well as the other astronauts inside, including the captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick with insulation against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented and "made" by the station's astronauts.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for his companions to open the board completely, and then he packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took a half-day break, and today, seven of them returned to the Discovery shuttle to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
EADS shares fall in price
The price of EADS shares fell sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aircraft and defense equipment company announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The price of EADS shares is currently at EUR 21.96 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for operating profit in 2007, as the development of the A400M engine was delayed, which obviously delayed the delivery of the aircraft.
The delay in the delivery of the tactical transport aircraft, which was announced in October, will cost between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will be affected by Airbus," the parent company of the European EADS manufacturer announced.
As a result of these expenses, EADS will have to publish new plan numbers for its 2007 operating profit next Thursday, when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but did not publish any further figures.
The group also indicated that it had taken account of the six-month delay in preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating profit decreased by 86%: this was largely due to a delay in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which also placed a heavy financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to hand over the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo remains.
Sunday’s elections are not a big surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for President Putin’s party, the United Russia.
In this, the Russians' need for stability, as it were, arbitrary governance, is manifested after a powerfully manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks to voters through public service channels in a television message, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin is leading the candidate list of the pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the head of state's behavior did not reveal anything: he only launched another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections without any violations,” he said.
However, according to the opposition, this is not the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, which they believe has put pressure on voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zjuganov, claims that "such a dirty election in Russia was not even in Yeltsin's time".
After last weekend's protests, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorised protest, and his lawyer claims he still can't be visited.
"The Russians are still thinking 'homo sovieticus'"
Predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who is following Putin in the head of state?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008, and candidates can indicate their intention to run until 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There are no other successors on the horizon.
What role will Putin play in March?
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or will he, as the leader of the all-powerful United Russia party or the parliamentary majority, decide on the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing power wins both parliamentary and presidential elections.
Now it has become a tradition.
"The Russians are still thinking like 'homo sovieticus': they don't feel like they can control their fate," says Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. All the more so, because this new paternalism was associated not with intimidation, but with certain economic prosperity," says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "willfully reject personal responsibility", which was quickly manifested after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all sectors of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the United Russia are led by 65 governors, who come from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cherednychenko, a 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Repressive Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive has become public, documenting the fate of the 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometers of shelves in Bad Arolsen, Hessen Province, have so far only been researched for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have only provided unique and named access to former victims or their descendants.
The eleven states managing the archives, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians in May 2006.
After all states ratified the Convention, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives allows historians to conduct research “on the relocation of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents, as they contain names and thus confidential information.
This may include, for example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo began to be collected after the war for practical reasons, with the aim of searching for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly providing evidence of their internment, which allowed them to receive compensation.
In Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are currently dealing with tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, part of the scientific community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
“These documents are basically nothing new,” said Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Antisemitism Research at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
EU and India to sign free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath announced.
EU foreign ministers approved in April last year that the European Commission would open negotiations for free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's number one trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner according to the European Commission's figures.
Mr Mandelson said: “A free trade agreement can be an economic boost for both sides, and India could increase its presence in a thriving market of 450 million people.”
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the European Commissioner added. The two giants, Europe and Asia, exchange "EUR 47 billion worth of products" and "EUR 10 billion worth of services" each year, said Dani?le Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week. At the same time, he regretted that bilateral trade in New India "has still not reached its full potential".

Bank of England pledges 10 billion pounds to the financial market for a five-week term
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the unrest over credit conditions, so on Thursday it announced that it will pump ?10 billion into the financial market, which it will make available with a base rate of 5.75% and, unlike usual, a five-week maturity.
“We want to alleviate the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we also want banks to be able to plan their liquidity positions more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank’s reserves will be offered on the international money market as part of a five-week open market operation from 6 December,” the bank said in a press release.
According to the bank’s announcement, a 10 billion pound (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank base rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time the Bank of England has issued liquid funds in an open market operation for five weeks.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release, the Bank of England added that it was "ready to take further measures" to ensure that interbank loans were aligned with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: it is currently at 6.6%.
Since the beginning of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has charged significant punitive interest on the amounts pumped into the financial market, which has deterred banks from using them.
Rumor has it that (which is only reinforced by the exchange rate of the pound against the euro) many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained at a more favourable interest rate and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to examine socialist proposal on purchasing power
The UMP and the Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to rejecting the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures, which were adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the restoration of a variable fuel tax, the introduction of travel cheques and the restriction of rents.
As UMP and NC voted against the articles in 180:115, the sometimes sharp-sounding discussion between the governing party and the opposition was finally interrupted, just a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's television speech on purchasing power.
The head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that he would resubmit all the proposals of his group in the framework of the amendment of the corrective draft financial law, which will be placed on the agenda of the Parliament next week.
A new festival is born
There were many rumors about the new music festival in Philadelphia organized by C3 Presents. However, now the company organizing and promoting the event announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with the British producer Melvin Benn, Festival Republic.
"We are honored to work with a man who is the starter of today's American festival movement," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey will be held in the summer, so there will be room for camping.
The festival will take place between 8 and 10 August in a private area of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Festival Republic director Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
He started organizing the British Reading Festival in 1989, which attracts about 80,000 visitors every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn continued to expand his palette by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival's production, license management and organizational tasks. This festival is now able to accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 called Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event" he ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
“The Philadelphia location has already been selected and we have worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to host this festival in the center of Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We had a discussion with the city and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, due to the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organization failed," Charlie Jones continued.
“Fortunately, we were able to talk to Melvin Benn about this, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival at another unique venue that will ultimately serve the interests of the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents brought the Lollapalooza festival back to life in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional talent as a festival organizer with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross revenue of the two events was $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held on a city site.
“Melvin Benn’s European concept is based on the country festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way to create both the European rural atmosphere and the American urban lifestyle."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The people of Vineland, and even the mayor himself, are enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in such an event at a location that hopefully will host the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "giant" in size, with a capacity of about 80,000 people at the Bonnaro music festival in Tennessee.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
“Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we’re planning a variety of music offerings so everyone can find something to enjoy,” says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Attal, form the C3 company, which received the "best independent event organizer" award at the recent Billboard Touring Awards.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator himself...
The "seduction" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" as California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger opposes shooting his own productions abroad.
Is it really difficult to fight the "Terminator Governor"?
“We have to be careful because the film industry decides for itself which is the best location for it.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our job is to offer the best possible conditions for them to decide on our behalf," Schwarzenegger says.
Competing for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now mostly focused on promoting Canadian films.
The competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many Quebec films as possible at every American film festival, whether it is Sundance Film Festival, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival.
The film, L’ge des ténébres, was well received at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
The film Shake Hands with the Devil will also be shown in Santa Monica and at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec was also represented by four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts share their views on the "subprime" crisis
Less than five weeks before the end of the fiscal year, investors are already rubbing their hands and can't wait for the usual end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, “from a statistical point of view, the stock market generally behaves positively in December.
However, forecasts with a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, in fact, the market is characterised by uncertainty in the current situation, at least in the short term".
Experts are far from advocating the stock market's year-end swing, although they state that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this gives an opportunity to invest because there are no guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed returns, which are negatively affected by the escape to quality securities, both in the long and in the short term".
As a result, they believe that the stock market will be characterised by a lateral movement that is not free of volatility, "especially since the impact of the Fed rate reduction is unknown at the moment, as the price of crude oil is high and inflationary tension is also threatened".
Javier Barrio, BPI’s sales manager in Spain, agrees, so it would be risky to say that there will be a rally.
According to the expert, "the situation is not at all rosy."
Ibex lost nearly 4 percent of the highest figures recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts are so obnoxious.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points due to the restructuring of wallets and payments to the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally shifts to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the celebration of the Constitution.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility will affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: "We are close to the technical level and are experiencing a decline in the stock market index, which may increase depending on the news from the United States, in terms of the consequences of the credit market crisis."
Analysts are confident that these will be beneficial.
Analysts agree on which securities will be aimed at achieving Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "this year it's the big securities."
The expert would add the two big banks and some construction companies to the list, “because by then the electric sector will be very expensive.”
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, if at all.
"ACS has been trying to regain its position for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow suit," he said.
Cyclical consumption will be the main player for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although there is not too much representation in the Spanish market in this area.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, there have been only two falls in the December exchange rate.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003 when stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6.68% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profitable year (currently Ibex shows an increase of 8.36% since January) and whether the end rally can take place.
Banco Popular Spanish opens an account open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Spain has decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These branches run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference to the bank.
However, it is also for other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose branches are unusually open continuously until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly said that it plans to extend the opening of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his branches in exchange for opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Spain will be crucial for the other institutions, as this will be the basis for deciding whether to join the initiative in favour of better opening of shops.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Spain project.
In these places, they would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate 200 branches across Spain for 18 months with the already mentioned opening hours, as it is not a new opening order, but a modification of the existing one.
To do this, the institution modernizes its branches in commercial zones according to the needs of the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new idea of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colorful design.
Ángel Rivera, responsible for commercial banks, points out that restructuring does not require a large investment, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Branches, which even include meeting rooms for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favorable experiences
Banco Popular has already implemented the initiative in its three Madrid branches.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
The drawers on the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said the decision was the right one.
Banco Popular Spain currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has very favorable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these units of PopularMax, they do not use the BBVA model, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
“We don’t want to create competition for our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external staff.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, acting advisor to Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the market yesterday when it turned out that the TV station he led doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Yet one thing overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it's not because we've risen more, but because we've fallen less," he said.
Even so, he placed great emphasis on the fact that we "falled less" in the weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This puts its annual loss at 15.66 percent.
The company owns 52 percent of Mediaset, 13 percent of Vocento, so its stock market value, according to Bloomberg data, is EUR 4.488.88 million.
His rival, Antena 3, lost 1.52% yesterday and has fallen 40.5 percent since January, so yesterday it was worth half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (published by Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The only question is how much we can deliver in the same market, at what cost, and how all this will pay off in terms of ratings.
Last week, Telecinco announced its intention to become the first TV channel with gross advertising revenue of more than $1 billion this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespa.
If the announced fact is realized, compared to the 965.4 million recorded in the 2006 financial year, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent in this financial year.
Net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year (thus reaching 734.4 million), while net sales of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that has triggered Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay-out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its parent company Mediaset.
“We officially guarantee a minimum payout of 50%, although we have always distributed a lot more.
I hope our shareholders will be happy with us this year, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33% of Endemol.”
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing some slowdowns.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to an estimated decrease in sales revenue from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
According to the same company's forecasts, Antena 3's profits will fall by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 reviews
1.
Ibersecurity: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high profitability and long-term sustainable potential of dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favorable (acquisition) than Antena 3 (retention) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends underweighting due to "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the takeover of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with the parliamentary process, which ended today with the congressional vote approving the Senate amendments, the government has initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law is based, so that both can enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups unanimously highlighted the efforts made by Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to establish the most favourable normative to protect investors and to regulate the activities of companies in detail in order to operate effectively in the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between different supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialised companies, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and order-executing internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange participants.
In addition, the Act requires investment service providers to provide market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk-taking and risk management methods, and to facilitate the control of CNMV, they must keep records of all operations carried out.
The Congressional Economic Commission has introduced a number of amendments. Of these, it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds due to the high risk they pose to the investor. This has been proven in the context of high-risk mortgage lending in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and business qualifications, 30 years after the royal decree defining the professional functions that can only be carried out by economists came into force in 1977.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the brokerage agent who works for another account, does not need the permission of CNMV and can market products or acquire customers for several investment companies at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the strategy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank to provide data that are comparable to data from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The same calculation method is used for the preliminary indicator as for the calculation of the Combined Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and may therefore deviate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The consumer price index remains relatively high."
Pedro Solbes, a vice-president of the government and Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November is only "temporary", but at the same time predicted that the price index is expected to be "relatively high" in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less at the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He added that the month of November was “less surprising” than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a large increase.
“We expected a value of around 4%,” the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged in connection with the data published today.
Northern Rock aims to raise 42 billion euros for Virgin in three years.
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently amount to only 12 billion pounds (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since it was in crisis in mid-September and had to take out an urgent loan from the National Bank of England.
At that time, it had a record number of deposits over ?25 billion, the number of which has gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to a loss of trust from customers, despite the fact that the government promised the bank a hundred percent guarantee until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will run this unit under its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money. Virgin will have to acquire about a quarter of British banks' revenues in the next three years to obtain the remaining ?18 billion pounds, reaching the goal of ?30 billion.
The prestigious businessman Richard Branson’s group, known for his high-profile advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend some 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve the goal set.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the best way to avoid bankruptcy. Besides Virgin, three other companies make up the consortium.
Mayor of Totana Arrested in Suspected Corruption Case
Earlier this morning, the Gendarmerie arrested the mayor of Totana, a town in Murcia province, on suspicion of being involved in an urban corruption scandal this week.
Besides him, they arrested one of the city hall's secretaries and the town's chief of police.
Former city council member José Martínez Andreo took over the place of the EPP representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies interviewed by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
Police continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and further arrests cannot be excluded.
Juan Morales’ lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to the SER radio station, the lawyer of the People's Party Juan Morales was arrested when he left Morales with documents related to corruption in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for signing an urban development agreement with a Galician construction company on the reclassification of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of the PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list in the next parliamentary elections in Toledo and to chair Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE Organisation Secretary José Blanci and confirmed by Bono himself after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The Prime Minister justified his election to the former Minister by saying that "we must count on the best" in politics, and Bono is "among the best".
He also added that the Mancha politician would "probably" be the candidate of the Socialist Party for President of Parliament if the Socialists won in the upcoming elections.
Bono would take the place of the current parliamentary president Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he had no intention of running for office in the next elections and that he would rather fight climate change in scientific circles.
The former Minister admitted that the Head of Government has constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he gave up active politics two years ago.
He also added that since voters are aware of who will be the vice-president of the economy in the event of the victory of the socialists, the party also wanted to inform them in the spirit of transparency who will be the president of Parliament.
If Bono really holds the post, he would like Parliament to be "a place of respect, not insult or shouting" and more like a citizen's home.
“Unfortunately, at times it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk in peace, there have been 26 interruptions of the speech of the Head of Government in the Senate,” he said.
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Marín, his "excellent work", but he did not want to present himself as president so that his opponents did not consider him "superior".
Campaign for Climate
Since the climate change movement relentlessly persecutes both those who are skeptical of their predictions and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, he must also side with a political leader like the Head of Government Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and proclaims that "we need to make a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who is responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
It should also clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits will the population have to change, what kind of individual and social energy savings will we have to expect and what will be the economic consequences?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our planet?
But we have not received and will not receive an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures taken by climate change, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, inconvenient and cost both for companies and the public.
Even PSOE's petrol price increase would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
In other words, we must save the Earth from nothing, only with propaganda texts, empty passwords without actual consequences.
Conventions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, he does not demand, he does not attack, he even embellishes the election meetings and inspires tenderness in us.

Totana Mayor and Chief of Police Arrested in Suspected Corruption Case
The Gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of Totana in Murcai Province, the People's Party José Martínez Andreo, the local Commissioner, the City Hall secretary and a catering contractor for crimes related to urban development, police sources informed today.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to City Hall, where he is currently with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of Industries and Housing.
The three arrests were preceded last Monday by the arrests of six people in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia in a case in which two hectares of agricultural land were reclassified as built-in land to allow the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 apartments after illegally paying commissions to leaders during their previous mandate.
Two others have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, according to the Totana Court of Justice.
The first six people arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now an independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the provincial centre of Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigra, Pontevedra, together with the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. The latter company also belongs to the Nuaria Group and the bribes were carried out through him.
The investigation is carried out by the Gendarmerie Operational Central Unit, a group charged with crimes committed at municipal level, whose members conducted eleven house searches in addition to arrests, mainly in companies related to those arrested, operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, only one person was arrested: the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area who could have played a mediating role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement currently with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Conycase in Vigo, which manages parking lots on Coruna, Venezuela and Catholic Ferdinand Square, Hogartel, which specializes in direct marketing and Preconiza, which deals with the sale, promotion and installation of building elements.

If they agree, we'll put the Book of the Month aside for a while and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I'm already equipped with one.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can figure something out for themselves.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of the largest daily newspapers in Finland: (certainly at the head of the PISA report on the world's level of culture), in Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what was published on 18 November at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn's book.
"The philosophical teachings came to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela High School.
In the messages of the killer, a student about to graduate, he quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councilor, Pekka Elo, in charge of teaching philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye and then added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in compulsory basic philosophy classes in secondary schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that in the Criminal Code there is a violation of the Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is a misdemeanor and is punishable from six months to one year.
However, if you steal a record worth less than 400 euros in a store, it is only a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, the theft is a misdemeanor, but the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading online (Art. 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still below the penalty for downloading it online (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy CDs.
If you take part in a mass fight, you can get a penalty of three months to one year (Art. 154 BTK), but a penalty of six months to two years for copying a CD
(Art. 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 1842 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the consent of the authors is more punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).

My family doctor gave me an article on strange research called "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less of it."
That is, the feelings of the workers on payday depend on how much the others received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonn by measuring magnetic resonances by tomography, and the results were published in the last issue of Science.
The study’s author and Bernd Weber, head of the Neurocognition Group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, said: “The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake.”
Researchers found that if both of them gave the right answer and received the same reward, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them received double amounts, activity increased.
I don't know why it took so much science to come to such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals for eight years from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court in The Hague, which investigates crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste in the mouth, as those responsible for the massacre in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian leader in Serbia Radovan Karajics are still at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). Like a real crime, the film follows the Swiss Attorney General's work from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments concerned to tighten the noose around fleeing sinners.
What insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which provides security to the owner of the car against various damage events, is significant and depends on several factors, such as age, gender, date of acquisition of the driving licence, marital status, type and use of the car to be insured.
Buying a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to be clear about what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance company undertakes to pay compensation for the fixed insurance premium in the event of the occurrence of the damage.
The insurance premium is practically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driver's license, marital status, type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
Insurance companies set the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. a higher amount is paid by the person who represents a higher risk of accident.
That’s why people over the age of 25 or women pay less because, according to statistics, they pose a lower risk because they are more careful.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, the frequency is decisive.
With more frequent use, the possibility of an accident increases.
Insurance companies take a number of factors into account when setting insurance premiums.
Therefore, the owner should carefully look into it so that he can choose the most suitable form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors in choosing to best adapt to the needs of the insured person and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 face a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and freshness of driving license.
Although it is ideal to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
More cautious drivers can take out a complete insurance with a self-part, thus ensuring against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured pays part of the damage.
“The amount of the deductible to be paid by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the deductible,” says Luis Noguera, First Europe’s Spanish head of internet insurance brokerage.
Another option is extended liability insurance to third parties when the customer insures himself against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it will be insured against theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are not yet 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, as this will affect the bonus and thus reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
It is called a bonus in relation to the basic tariff of the insurance company.
And the penalty imposed compared to the basic tariff is called malus.
"The amount of bonus and rasp depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company had a good year, it can afford to raise the bonus rate,” Noguera explains.
Once the age limit of 25 has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to take out adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
At this point, we advise you to take out a full insurance.
"In general, young people are not yet able to apply their experience properly in an accident or even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when drivers have already overcome the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but does not have children yet, it is best to take out a complete insurance policy, of course, if your financial possibilities allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, so in their case the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, it is best to have a full insurance deductible (up to 300 euros), or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend the insurance to damage caused to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time have more purchasing power and can afford to have a higher share," Luis Noguera confirms.
In the case of pensioners, we recommend the full insurance with a self-part (which is around 150 euros) or in the case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to liability insurance.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it protects the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a large expense, so it is essential to choose the right form of insurance.
Celtic wants to score in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will match their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to score the missing point at the end of the Champions League. The Italians will be the first to qualify and the Scots will be able to qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points and already in the fifth round they have secured a draw with Portugal, but Celtic has nine points, but it would take one more to prevent the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica.
The two matches of Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milán will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where he will try to make it to the 16th final in the semifinal on the 13th.
With this, Group D will close sooner than the others, and although the most likely result at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the draw, the two teams will strive to win, since the Italians do not want to miss home, and Celtic will be the first to start from a better place in the eighth final.
Even losing to Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but you can't be sure of that, because if there's a point equal, the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won the next match (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the Scottish night miserable, who want to get into the eighth final of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after they just scored a goal from the Rooster in the 0-0 draw extension (1-0).
The victory of "Rossonerik" would be most welcome by Shakhtar, because if Celtic loses, they'll be in the eighth final and stay in UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in last place at the moment and having no chance of staying in the European Championship, can still win the third place with a victory to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls began their tour in Vancouver, Canada, performing in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) announced a few minutes before the concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band was in great shape.
Some 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, where a video was presented in the 1990s about the history of the band.
At the same time as the band regrouped and the tour, EMI released a new album in Spain, featuring the larger hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of the Spice Girls took the stage in a bracelet from the husband of "Posh Spice", the British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although Victoria forbade him a few days earlier.
In the announcement of the performance, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not seen our performance clothes yet, so I am nervous about what she will think of the performance".
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band disbanded two years after leaving the band in 1998 "because the members didn't understand each other." He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings for the Spice Girls had changed.
I thought, why not? Now I'm glad I decided to do so," said Chisholm about the band, which was disbanded nine years earlier because of him.
The singer added that in the meantime "things have settled down and we love each other very much".
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on Virgin Airlines' special plane.
At the airport, a group of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California, U.S.A., then in San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
Their performance in Madrid will be on December 23rd.
Russia-Ukraine gas dispute concerns
The gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is channelled through Ukraine, and disputes between the two nations are always under close scrutiny.
Kiev said that if Moscow increases the gas price to be paid by Ukrainians, they will also impose higher transit costs on Russia.
As a result of a previous dispute between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow relates to the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom's attempt to reach an agreement on the level of gas prices to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will have to increase its gas production from neighbouring Turkmenistan by 50% compared to the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% price increase for Ukraine's shipment from Gazprom.
“It is important that during the negotiations we argue in line with one of the most important transit states for natural gas,” Ukraine’s Economy Minister Anatoly Kinah told Reuters.
“The changes to gas prices should certainly be linked to our debate on the extent of the costs of transit through Ukraine (and into Western Europe).”
As a result of the recent significant gas price dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom blocked the gas tap leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like reduction in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly pushed prices up.
Russia accounts for a quarter of the EU’s gas supply.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS is “obliged to monitor foreign workers”
Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, a supervisory body said.
The proposal came after a foreign national doctor in Scotland was linked to the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of employees overseas.
However, in its report, through a sample of five health authorities, it also pointed to key controls that were properly implemented.
Following the attack on Glasgow Airport, the Auditor General checked the list of employees recruited outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors questioned by the Old Bailey court in October on the charge of car bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees must verify the skills and work experience of the workers concerned and their authorisation to work in the United Kingdom before starting employment for their employees from overseas countries.
Although Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Scotland to verify criminal records, the agency is not authorized to obtain such information from outside the UK.
Among other things, the Chief Accountant's report suggested that the committees introduce the Criminal Records Office's guide, which facilitates the employer's control processes with different overseas countries.
"Although there is evidence of such checks in the personnel records, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Black said that while the Scottish NHS is performing its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: "Our report highlights the areas of the system that can be improved in order to keep up-to-date on the number of NHS personnel from overseas."
According to Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, it is "extremely unrealistic" to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who may commit terrorist acts in the future.
“According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently in place in NHS Scotland are working well, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent,” he added.
According to Scottish health authorities, the current number of their overseas employees, mostly doctors and nurses, is 1161.
However, the chief accountant drew attention to the fact that the figures are likely to be higher, which is partly due to the fact that committees have a problem identifying employees on permanent leave.
The investigation has also shown that the control procedures in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and qualification documents.
The Scottish Government is currently examining a policy and guidance on pre-employment inspections of NHS employees from overseas countries.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was very pleased that this task was carried out after the attack on Glasgow Airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals in the report and will ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment checks for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects best practice. The updated version is planned to be published next month.
Joy Division at the Film Awards
Joy Division's late singer Ian Curtis' biopic "Control" won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, was awarded a prize, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis was performed, as well as director Anton Corbijn and side character Toby Kebbell.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the thriller "Details of a Scandal."
And the Variety Prize was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond, for the international spotlight of the British film.
The awards were awarded in the framework of the ceremony held at Roundhouse, London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis' rise within Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at the age of 23.
The black and white film featuring "The Killers", David Bowie and "New Order on the soundtrack" cost only 3 million pounds.
Yet the Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously become known for making the album cover of U2 "Joshua Tree", was enriched with two awards; the award of the best director and the best starting director.
Another award winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, won the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his performance as the driver of David Cronenberg's thriller in London, the mob boss of "Murder Promises."
Ray Winstone, famous for his tough-guy roles, received the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes the films "Scum", "Ehkoppon" and "Sexy Beast", is currently involved in the production of the film "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after Harris, the star of "Camelot" and "Harry Potter" who died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door," Winstone said.
“I feel very lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time, and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bifa include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people in connection with terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants involved in terrorist cells who were planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility and several strikes on church personnel and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells tried to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to the television report, an eight-man cell led by a foreign national was planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After an attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, Saudi Arabia began building a rapid response force of 35,000 to protect the facilities.
According to a report by the Interior Minister, 18 of those arrested belong to a cell led by a person who illegally crosses the border and specializes in missile launches.
The report also reported that the fighters tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom's territory.
22 of the detainees planned to commit assassinations against church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action by church leaders to stop Saudis joining al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting against allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by Saudi hardline Sunni.
Al-Qaeda fighters view a significant part of Saudi Arabia's church leaders as supporters of the government's royal family policy.
The militants of the organization, inspired by the call of Al-Qaeda's Saudi-born leader Osama bin Laden to target the West-friendly Saudi government, set the goal of attacking foreign settlements, government buildings and energy facilities.
“Security forces have made tremendous efforts over the past...five months,” an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
During the arrests, a 16-person "media cell" was also caught in Medina with the aim of spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims branded as unfaithful and apostate.
The arrests also included 32 people accused of financial support for militants.
Venus' climate could give us a glimpse into the future of the Earth
According to scientists, Venus once provided pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is more of an Earth's whimsical twin than we previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet neighbor to Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, billions of years ago Venus could have had very similar living conditions and even habitable conditions.
However, due to the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the planet's lower rotation speed, Venus has entered a very different development path.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it is destroyed by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year's study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor of physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "It's starting to show why Venus' climate differs so much from Earth's experience, despite the fact that the two planets are very similar.
“With our new data, it has been possible to develop a scenario for the formation of Venus billions of years ago, when it may have had habitable conditions like Earth.
Uranium seized by police
A kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but he stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Doors wide open
According to Mitt Romney, it is not worthy of a candidate running for president to answer questions from a snowman.
Yet Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate broadcast on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions put on Wednesday night on 28 November were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate on YouTube of the other party.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching next year's election.
It is not yet known on what basis the producers of CNN, which co-financed the debate, selected the YouTube videos submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half hour of the debate was immigration.
That's one of the Republicans' canoes.
CNN has asked some undecided voters to dial a number if something goes wrong: the mediator has experienced outstanding agreement when the candidates have spoken hard on the issue of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Rudy Giuliani at national level and Romney at the crucial pre-elections held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him treating illegal immigration too lightly during his mayorship in New York.
He accused Romney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house.
The battle between the two became particularly intense when the questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would ensure permanent status and the possibility of citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as representatives of Duncan Hunter in California and Tom Tancredo in Colorado, have managed to dig deep into the subject.
And although none of them are likely to stand a chance on the nomination, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the immigration bell sooner and louder than the others.
At least on the issue of immigration, there is a broad consensus among candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take hard action against illegal immigrants.
This issue, like the fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the division between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
However, when other topics came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported gun control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether the simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner wanted to know if the candidates believed all the words of the Bible.
In this regard, Giuliani stumbled upon the view that although he viewed the Bible as his favorite book, he might not interpret the story of Jonah and the whale literally.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won the first place in the recent election in Iowa, thanks to his persistent Christian conservatism, responded to expectations by saying that the death penalty is painful, but it is necessary.
When asked if Jesus would have enough support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than running for office.
The competition is unusually open.
Huckabee's dynamic rise in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fundraising campaign and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding the debate on Wednesday.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who sounded the victory message of America's greatness in time and convincingly, and who found a common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences are unforeseeable for the time being.
Labour's pain
There is another gap in front of Gordon Brown; the way out remains the same
Compared to the British political scandals, this one doesn't look too saucy.
No one sold his honor, no politician found his hotel bills in Paris, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
However, the discovery that a wealthy businessman, under the names of others, has made a secret contribution to the Labour Party governing Great Britain for more than four years with an amount exceeding EUR 650,000 ($1.3 million), and that the party has not reported this is one of the things without which the entrenched Gordon Brown would have been well done.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got away with the election, and when his statement - that the polls did not influence the outcome of the decision - recklessly questioned the British's intellectual ability, people still hoped that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, deputy leader of the liberal democrats, noted with increasingly witty remarks, the once dreaded Brown Stalin was transformed into Mr. Bean.
The mistake of rescuing a distressed bank called Northern Rock has put regulatory weaknesses and lack of judgment in the crossfire.
Sick proposals to change the tax law have encouraged business interest groups to join forces with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authority revealed an unimaginable degree of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals instigated mutiny, protesting against the reduction of the army's budget, stating that the Minister of Defence's position was a part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour Party (formerly administrative leader), has already resigned.
These accidents don't mean Brown can't turn back on the road to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where control becomes impossible.
People don't like politicians and don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as soon as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is most likely not fit to move things forward and may not stay in his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil servants' staff will start leaking, the Cabinet Ministers will start briefing, the press will look for bad news; and the government will start defending and will be unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he is not "fresh blood".
As much as he'd like to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he was still his right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and IRS records, for example, are linked to decisions made during Brown’s finance ministership.
And while Blair's missteps - such as the protracted investigation of the relationship between "nobility for money" and political party funding - were not directly involved, voters can rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it seems.
The blunders you've committed aren't as scary as the Tories make them out to be.
Like Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was directly tricked.
And compensation, no matter how painful it is, can be the creation of the trends promised by Stalin in Brown: reliable, solid and slightly hard-handed government.
A good example is the fuss about political donations.
The garboian mysterious Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, said that he did not want to reveal his good deed to the public.
Perhaps so, but making the decision was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and can be justified: the population has the right to know who knocks on the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own statement, was aware of Abrahams' actions, but was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during the interrogations; just like Jon Medleson, the Labour Party's foundation leader, who learned of the confusing donations in October.
Brown, on the other hand, has no leads for the time being: there is no indication that he knew about these twists, not even that the huge amounts were paid after Brown took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, he diluted his strength by using a familiar tool; he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the case, just to be safe.
In this story, the "lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation of the law, the police are responsible.
In addition, Brown needs to clean up other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of the independent committee that has been working without a leader for six months on administrative rules or the promotion of effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard-hatted Labour Party to cooperate with the Torik and break up with the special financial ties associated with the associations - this would be a tough one for the party-like Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to win back the voters; the only way to win is impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card Sharks
Is the second-market mortgage crisis threatening America's credit card market?
When blood enters the water, it is natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the loss of the credit card market could reach $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the write-down rate showing the ratio of non-recoverable loans and the default rate indicating the ratio of late payments over 30 days have increased.
HSBC reported a $1.4 billion loss in the U.S. consumer finance segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of cardholders.
However, panic is still early.
The rates of write-offs and late payments remain low.
The late payment rate of 3.89% calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decline in rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the US rules on individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sharp decrease in the number of insolvency applicants, while at the same time causing a large loss on the credit card market; the number of bankruptcy applications (and thus the write-down rate) is expected to increase again, regardless of whether the totality of the borrowing conditions deteriorates or not.
The payment rate, which shows the rate of monthly credit repayment by consumers, is also solid in the market.
In addition, trust in credit-card-backed securities is quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney at TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market is clear: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay home loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor financial flows and not asset values, and therefore the fall in housing prices does not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage loan, consumers will have a reduced incentive to repay the loan; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will move forward in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or lending limits, card issuers can adapt to changing conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage lenders.
Theoretically, this should reduce the risk of sudden re-prices of assets.
“It’s unlikely that we’ll wake up one day to completely revalue our loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
If a subprime-like sudden crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is more likely.
If falling housing prices and falling lending push America into recession, the industry will no doubt face a grim future.
It's worth watching those predatory fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case
On Wednesday, the three British bankers who were brought to justice to investigate their role in the fraud associated with Enron's former financial director Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded innocent of seven counts of fraud that they allegedly cooperated with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000 to get rich at the expense of their employer.
Their trial began in January.
However, at a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of single-order fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest division of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation into the case launched after Enron's collapse in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government's investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers named "NatWest Three" were accused of traveling to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare the fraud together with Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was then Fastow's right-hand man.
Fastow, who was responsible for planning the countless frauds that bankrupt Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank's $1 million stake in the subsidiary.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to acquire a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying the $20 million subsidiary share from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, the $20 million was in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the prosecution, the bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed to his two-order guilt for his role in Enron's collapse.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in a Texas prison.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States, where they were staying during the trial, for a bail of $1 million each.
Enron, once the seventh largest U.S. company, filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 after the accounting tricks used for years could no longer cover the millions accumulated as debt and the profitable but actually loss-making companies.
As a result of the collapse, thousands of jobs have been lost, market value has fallen by more than $60 billion, and pension funds have fallen by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their complicity in the company's bankruptcy.
Skilling is currently serving more than 24 years in prison.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges against Lay ended with the man's death last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow.
At $54 million, a Gulfstream G550 aircraft with a Rolls-Royce engine will make the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
However, for some Russian rich, this amount is only a small change.
“It can hold 18 passengers,” said Gulfstream representative Dan Firer.
"But no one orders so many seats, because machines are bought for private families or corporate executives."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors to the four-day exclusive Millionaires Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall in the vicinity of the capital city.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury goods suppliers rented booths at the exhibition, hoping that the Russian new rich are interested in everything, from mahogany-covered yachts to diamond-coated 50-cent grilles.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche displayed on the stand next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not worth our products," he said.
“Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States.”
The Russian capital seems to be floating in money like Dallas did in its prime at the time of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were considered materialistic here," said Marshall Goldman, senior scholar at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabians of the 1970s and Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold rush.
At a conference organized by the luxury industry in another Moscow location, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, shared their views on how to sell high-value products in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes’ list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billionaires with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who have a total of $670 billion, according to a study by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyses personal welfare development in the former Soviet Union.
(According to World Bank data, the number of people living below the living standard in Russia was 15.8 percent in 2005.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative at David Morris Jewellery Store in London.
Nicole attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed, and men are a treasure trove."
On Sunday evening, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, in evening dresses, attributed both themselves and their customers to millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Yumatova, who was brazenly dressed in his unique design, as if he were used to this fuss.
The fair was primarily organized for the new rich, brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around a drafty, fancy-decorated venue after several hours in circulation, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund plush bears at the same time.
For the average person, the ticket costs 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who took a patriotic seat at the stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, as opposed to a wall-sized, hand-decorated Rembrandt imitation painted on blue tiles.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here said that the long-standing rich Russians (based on Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) have already switched from blatant logos to bagatell, limited editions of brands that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, filled the room every day.
Some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of King Koil beds, said that he sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, each worth $70,000.
Also on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, a sales associate of A1 Moto, who supplies high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer that provides solutions to individual needs, sold three grilles for Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon. The grilles resemble connected chain bracelets and cost $55,000 each.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for a Russian casino owner, which he said Swarovski used crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin and a picture of his wife's face made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily use these objects," Karapetian said.
"Instead, he'll keep them in his garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian says the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid rise in real estate prices there.
“Anyone who bought a property in Moscow four or five years ago is now likely to be a millionaire, if not in money, or at least on paper,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least create the appearance of wealth in front of the stand of the Russian asset management company Alliance Continental.
The company built four English-style telephone booths that were hoarded with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes at the Millionaires Fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many of them took pictures of themselves with their cell phones as they lay around in a lot of money, or they just pocketed a few million.
"You see, everyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
Surgical Malpractice Suspected After Death in New Jersey
The day before Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked out the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just A Little Healthier" and saw an ambulance stop on Cape Cod two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Shortly thereafter, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another.
“Then I saw the doctor’s car stop,” Mr. Livingston, who works at the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
"Then I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo. She used to work as a senior assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
The investigation is currently ongoing to determine whether the death was caused by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon working at 212 West Scott Avenue, not identified by the police.
Authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the toxicology tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has hurt high-ranking Newark police officers.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been an assistant to the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006.
"He was loyal, hardworking and reliable," McCarthy told Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector.”
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer, currently working on the Committee on the Control of Spirit Products, and left behind two boys, 14 and 11 years old, as well as a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for Union County prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said the investigators were working to determine whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgeon's intervention.
"There's a probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3 p.m. in November.
On the 21st and Mrs. Arroyo was found on the couch.
He's already been declared dead at the scene.
It's been over a week, and the police have so far revealed very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't say if Castro had been heard by the detectives yet.
Participants in the study are researching whether part of the house functioned as a doctor's office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Castro’s home, where a wilted rosebush stood in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the cellar, in the driveway there was a blue tank marked "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hanging from hooks on the side.
McCarthy recalled when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the NYPD, Mrs Arroyo was invaluable in helping her navigate the unusual and uncut political culture of the new city.
"He always said, 'You'll be better off with this and that,'" he remembered.
“He was always there when I arrived in the morning, and he was always there when I left in the evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations of Fed interest rate cuts lead to a surge in world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday after the vice president of the US Central Bank's reassuring statements increased his hopes that the Fed would try to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
Stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have plummeted since Donald Kohn, who is the right-hand man of Fed President Ben Bernanke, said leaders need to respond “flexibly and pragmatically” to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets.
In addition to Kohn’s clear goal of calming markets amid signs of a resurgent credit crisis, he stated that the current unrest “partly set back the development of the market at the end of September and October”.
He said that if the increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
Investors have interpreted the statements as saying that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest rate cuts in order to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements also calmed Wall Street, which has recently been hit by a number of bad news about the American economy, such as the negative record of US housing sales.
The side effect of the financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement by Bear Stearns investment bank that it would lay off 650 workers and 4% of its global workforce in order to compensate for losses in the U.S. second-market housing loan sector as part of the cost reduction.
A total of 20 jobs are affected by the above measure at the London headquarters with 1500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13,289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The FTSE 100 index in London increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2, thus increasing the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
Germany's Dax grew by 2.6%, while France's CAC40 grew by 2.3%.
The turmoil in the credit market was renewed after European banks received three-month-long papers at a high-demand auction organised by the European Central Bank at a price of 4.7 percent that had not been seen since April 2001.
With the English interbank interest rate, Libor, after steady growth since November 12, reaching the highest level seen since September, 6.59%, the Bank of England was under increasing pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to add additional capital to the London financial market.
England demands a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the English team's number six jersey in Kandy, Owais Shah's or Ravi Bopara's?
And in the context of the first test against Sri Lanka, is it no less important who makes the decision?
The latter question is relevant, on the one hand, because David Graveney, the president of the selectors, who is temporarily performing this particular task, is helping the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision. On the other hand, because the drawer of the English Managing Director Hugh Morris' desk is starting to fill with requests for national or at least one-time selection posts.
Of the two players, the one that doesn't get the sixth batting place pulls the shorter one, but as we know, life, and especially sport, is often unfair.
It is never easy to tell what makes a person reach the top of his profession, while others cannot get beyond even a lower level.
It is not only cricket that is difficult to select - often on a subjective basis -.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, if, say, John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications and knowledge of business, were put before decision-makers, while there is only room for one of them.
Who can tell which level a cricketer belongs to without being thrown into the deep end of a major tournament?
Of course, the data greatly influences the decision, but the opportunities are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain's look at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batter has to get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the eye of the picker is much more complicated.
For example, more than James Anderson played better last season, yet he's a sure team member in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison says he's in good shape and he's doing very well.
Anderson fought his tour with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but they've both had successful moments at the highest level, and they hope they'll continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium will be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can make or break anyone's career, but it may not have a special impact on the future.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet it was the then emerging Paul Collingwood who became a prominent and decisive test cricketer, who may still be underestimated today, despite winning double points against the Australians in Australia.
It is likely that at their meeting at Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will vote with Shah's greater experience against Bopara's young life force and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is in favour of his bright and successful debut in the districts of the 88 Bombay test. Against the 22-year-old Bopara six, who is seven years younger than him, who also scored 32 first-class hundred in excellent twists.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player Shah ran only ten against the West Indies at home in Lorda in May, as well as the fact that Vaughan, who fought for him again in the next game, seemed to reduce the endurance that was clearly visible in Bombay.
In contrast to him, Essex's universal talent is a cheerful and unsurpassed player.
There's nothing to upset him about on the cricket court, but he was good at his off-track behavior when he flipped over at an exhibition with a four-wheeler of the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
Nevertheless, the first thing he did after that was to pick up his (of course sponsored) Vodafone phone and call his remote-watching teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better fieldside player with classics. With his sliding medium steps, he creates an advantageous pitch angle, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and choosing the right moment is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance right now, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would be outstanding if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he was the one playing on the weekend.
Refugees are being transported home by buses to work and fight al-Qaeda
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria to Baghdad have been arriving with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired visas, or even those who hope that order has been restored in the city.
There are also those among them who have returned to fight the soldiers who chased them out of their houses.
The Mansour bus station was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled dozens of buses arrived.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” said Sunni doctor Sabah al-Qubaisi.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and that the city is safe now.
“They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people,” he added, referring to Moqtada al-Sadr, a militant pastor who has currently shut down his Shiite army.
The 38-year-old Shiite teacher Qassim al Atwani from Amariyah, predominantly Sunni, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis from taking a job.
The neighbors of the Shita of Amarija telephoned him and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American-supported troops, he managed to push Al-Qaeda out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shia tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had created an anti-Al Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the support of my sons.
That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have said that peace has been strengthened in the capital since the entry of American troops and that they have been lured home by armed civilian forces working with the Americans.
However, more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, with three children, voiced a widespread view among refugees that Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian government to reject the visa application of refugees to force their return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have fled from the death squads in the country.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis in order for them to move back home,” he said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled.”
One of the reasons for the relief of violence was that the Sunni were expelled from the Shia territories, while the Shia also left the Sunni inhabited areas, resulting in a reduction in tension in many regions.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will upset the moods again, which may lead to further fighting.
Small Saarland - high-quality training
The smallest federal province is a leader in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
There is only one training area where Saarlanders struggle with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"Yesterday, for the 50th time, I explained to someone outside the Saarland that we are not French," he wrote on his posters on the occasion of the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the Saar region, which, based on the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW) in Cologne, can boast the fifth place.
In this way, higher education institutions cooperate closely with neighbouring countries, even because of tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6% high.
However, students who want to study in the Saar region are also attracted above average by colleges and universities in the Saar region - many of them do not have a high school degree.
“In the Saarland, opportunities for professional training are being exploited,” explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than a fifth of young people gain further education in vocational schools, making the Saar region more than seven percent higher than the federal average.
The combination of professional and higher education is also well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is the second largest in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practice-oriented training and growing interest, the number of graduate engineers has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education obliged higher education institutions to conduct a marketing campaign focusing on engineering sciences.
“In primary schools, we initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study,” a spokesman for the Education Ministry said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that in the meantime the other federal provinces have begun to copy.
Only future comparative studies will answer whether the performance of students is permanently improved.
According to the 2003 Pisa survey, the proportion of students at risk has shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland has not improved as much as that of the other Landes.
Bavarians count better.
To the greatest annoyance of the Saarlanders, foreign language knowledge is not taken into account in the Pisa survey - otherwise, they could otherwise reap credit in this area,
The language of the neighboring countries is a compulsory subject in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chavez changes the clocks
In the near future, the clocks in Venezuela will be different from those in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez will turn the timers back half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
According to Venezuela’s official newspaper, a new law requires clocks to be turned back four and a half hours compared to Greenwich time.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the entire clock-based time zones were forced into the world by the United States.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday that relations with neighboring Colombia had been cut off due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not maintain contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my own dignity," Chavez said, calling for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to form an opinion within the framework of a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxist rebels.
Uribe's decision "spits in the face" Venezuela, he voiced his criticism on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
In the country, a new mobile ringer has attracted attention: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut up), this is the sentence that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
The sentence comes from Károly János, King of Spain, who at the last Latin America summit was so upset by the constant interjections of the populist politician of Ballolda that he cut into his word.
Germany’s wage cuts in 2007
According to one forecast, German workers are at risk of real wage decline this year despite strong economic activity.
Experts have supported their pessimistic forecasts for a number of reasons.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler Foundation, employees can actually expect less pay in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage development, increased VAT and a rapid increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research told the daily Bild.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in relation to unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said in a statement to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that in the current situation, it is correct and reasonable to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3% at the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be placed in a difficult position to apply to the alliance for credit or support, the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD politician, was quoted.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation in 13 years.
In a year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is the Earth's evil twin.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to Earth than it has been assumed: in its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" space probe discovered lightning discharges and wind turbulences such as those produced on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightning.
The European "Venus Express" space probe provided evidence - it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 kilometers, reports Christpher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the columns of the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "old soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms triggered reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but it's her twin," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, so similar in mass and size to Earth, is on a completely different path of development.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early nineties, no probe has been specifically on its way to find this planet.
The latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles, according to researchers, do not only prove the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also point out that the similarity of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we initially assumed," Esa said.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, researchers also discovered a much faster moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds me of the air currents of the Earth's winter hemisphere, according to the research team led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, it is almost the size of the Earth.
The celestial body, also called the Evening Star, orbits the sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own axis: a Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus' surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with a pressure of 92 bar, hardly resembles Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under completely similar conditions.
Both of them had accumulated water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus it left for the universe.
And while on Earth carbon dioxide was bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus it forms a large part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with Dalai Lama
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, demands the end of the dispute between parties that erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the reception in September.
German President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the debate around the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“On this issue, we should not be seen as a divided nation to the outside world,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
“For me, human rights are universally valid, even if I respect the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, he defended Merkel against the accusation that the chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
“The Federal Chancellor has not broken with the traditional one-China policy.
China is aware of this,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his displeasure with the reception of the Dalai Lama and therefore became a target of attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "package policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office, there were violent disturbances in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese President Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the official reception of Tibetan religious leaders by European politicians, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's actions and words have shown that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan territories, including today's provinces, from China.
Schuuble warns against riots like those in France
Street clashes with the police, gunshots, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schauble protects against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social unrest in Germany does not lead to street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior demands.
Barricades were on fire, rioters shot at police officers with shotguns: After the serious riots of young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must take care that the social explosives do not accumulate in our country and do not end in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people adjust to rapid changes in social reality.
Alliances, provinces and communities are currently working intensively to solve problematic cases, said Schaeuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, we have the first successes."
However, it is still too early to resolve the emergency.
Schuuble pointed out at the same time that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people fought with the police in a serious street fight.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, head of the Turkish Communities of Germany, demanded a greater degree of activity from the federal government in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned of the "dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
First of all, more educational places should be provided.
Kolat said, “We need to give young people a perspective.”
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "Despite this, we must be on guard."
“Young people should be given the opportunity to work and receive education as soon as possible.”
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete calm during the night.
Hundreds of police officers were ready to deploy, scanning the area with a helicopter headlight.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as some burning garbage cans and cars.
Since the report, a safety unit of around 1000 people has ensured peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after her visit to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots broke out in connection with a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the State's Attorney's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
A Cloudwalker in Angela's Empire
The chancellor's out-of-the-way action is proof that the coalition is at the end - and nothing can be expected from him.
In which country does the Federal Chancellor live?
Following his bleak, indifferent and meaningless action in the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be stated that he does not live here - in the country whose government is his responsibility.
Angela Merkel rejected the accusation with a very superior sentence that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
This is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate the reproaches are.
In the meantime, neither specific interest nor empathy was felt for the problems of the country.
Instead, Angela Cloudwalker emerged: a politician who flees from reality into foreign policy and there is only uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: He praises himself unbridledly for the Heiligendamm Decisions, but he is silent about how the climate goals should be achieved in the country.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned - such modesty would not have been allowed two years earlier by the President of the CDU.
Now he clings to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
This harms his reputation as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of words.
However, in the realm of cloud-walking Angela, domestic political problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and low income problems?
This is only worth a few half sentences.
From this point of view, it is telling how often he stumbles when it comes to family allowances.
It takes Merkel three times to come up with a half-baked sentence.
When it comes to specifics, he wanders into a foreign area.
Storm Division
During the debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard change of punch - and now they also have to fear an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has surfaced in connection with the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his opponent Rudy Giuliani of making New York a "safe haven for illegal immigrants".
"I'd say his own house was a refuge for illegal immigrants," Giuliani retorts, throwing up at the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants as private citizens.
The candidates are on the run: Since the Republican camp still does not have a uniformly supported favorite, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN above all to undermine their opponent's credibility.
The 30-second videos sent by Internet users via Youtube are little more than brief summaries.
"This is the kind of isolationism that brought Hitler to power," says John McCain, under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle demanding an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam's veteran when he is reluctant to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding" as torture, the method of interrogation in which drowning is simulated.
That the important topics of the campaign are, after all, beyond Iraq and the debates on torture, is shown by the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida.
A loud applause breaks out in the room in praise of conservative values and in rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more evident.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney repents and apologizes to supporters and television viewers for voting in 1994 for abortion.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is swayed when asked for his opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf governs for the first time as a civilian
One day after his withdrawal from the army, Musharraf, who exercised power in Pakistan, was sworn in as President.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a further five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the capital, the presidential palace in Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to the Constitution and to act for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus yielded above all to international pressure from the United States.
Eight years after his rise to power in the form of a military coup, the former general is now ruling as a civilian head of state for the first time.
With Musharraf withdrawing as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will end the state of emergency shortly after his oath, with which he will meet another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, in which Musharraf introduced sympathetic lawyers at the beginning of November following the declaration of the state of emergency, rejected any protests over the disputed re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others injured as a result of an assassination of a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb was detonated on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are back.
The German supergroup of the 1970s is playing again: Three band members of Harmonia dusted their instruments again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reassembly, a cut recording from their prime, the time of "Live 1974" appears.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation is embodied in the person of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each one has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, with his 63 years in a white shirt, sits in the middle.
From the left, Michael Rother, who is 57 years young, is accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the audience's point of view, 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is bent and focused on the console.
Each one of them makes some kind of noise, and once in a while, it's a rhythm.
Sometimes it just happens to be traditional music.
However, all this does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great thrill for the lovers of Krautrock music that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of a proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name passed through the collective pop memory, but in no way left such lasting traces that this band is sorely missed after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the legends of their 70s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called Krautrock has always been valued more in England and America than in his own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award for the oeuvre to the still living members of the Cologne Can band in 2003, the German pop figures sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When he thanked even La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudation of Red Hot Chili Peppers, the amazement became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage as an old buddy with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is overloaded by Harmonia only because the trio existed for only two years, and during that time it had a far less impact than others subsequently attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, one for the church-funded record company.
Rother helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and at the same time he gained fame as the guitarist of Neu!, perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster into their exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th - century Rom as a communist.
Less ideologically than in Commune I, where Roedelius was still a babysitter.
Their lives are more of an idyllic artist.
It is said that the flag of the Harmonia Ottenstein songbird came out of the trash and thus found a name for their art.
Some things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band suffered financial need.
The collection of roses alone did not ensure self-discovery.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record number of less than 50 people, so someone remembers.
Forced Harmonia and occasional practice were Rother's idea at the time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up in esoterics and supported himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster was revived in the '80s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The live album in Griessem is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, Greenland, set the goal of caring for the Krautrock as its unique German addition to live music.
In this context, Neu! has already been dug up as well as Roedelius' solo creation.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the House of Cultures in Berlin.
Public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, our British ancestor and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler" is also present.
There is also Dr. Motte, the founder of Loveparade.
All of this roughly outlines the impact of krautrock on the subsequent pop music era.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the empty space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement floats along with the most unusual sounds in the room: "The only true music is his future."
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in a farmhouse room.
The screening of additional black and white photographs of tangled wiring equipment serves the building of legends.
In the foreground, the three veterans are once again engaged in improvisation.
This simply means that microphones are attached to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of extracting unheard sound effects from the instruments using devices that produce their own acoustic effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-deep DIYers.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenstern's command, they cough and whisper, and at a beautiful part, they sing "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts "'68!", he's not on the wrong path, and Harmonia still won't let him get away with it.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can grind a person nervously, or it can give him the passing moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
Through "Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films once again deal with the Balkan war.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help that in "The Hunt."
First of all, the good news: Although the two war criminals Karajics and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the '80s, as the many good-boy-nothing roles played in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on Buddhism have even discouraged us from looking at him.
And suddenly, Richard Gere is the most powerful argument for maybe watching the movie "Hunting."
It gives a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the Simon Hunt war correspondent he formed is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry had not been so gracious to him: A man who had long left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline as a ruin-like monument preserved a significant part of his former attraction.
However, the film "Hunting" and also this week's German production "Mörderischer Frieden" continues only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not require much words: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her as an encore.
Although it is to be welcomed that for once the Serbs are not the only cause of all evil, the film carrying the shallowness of TV films is lost too quickly in shootings and eventful scenes.
It carries the "Cobra 11" character - war instead of highway.
On the other hand, in the case of "Hunting", it can be examined by example why no really good film has actually been made about the Balkan war.
The story of the three U.S. war correspondents who rise up to seek out the Serbian war criminal named "Róka", with another director, another screenwriter (both in Richard Shepard's personal Faluno) could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" in a different age.
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups start the forest to do what the army can't do - and in both cases, it's a journey to madness.
One of the reasons for the fall of "Hunting" is that he simply doesn't let Simon Hunt be the depraved cynic that he first introduces him to.
No, and in addition to the script, he's spending a romantic relationship with a Muslim Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
The "Hunting" slips away when reporters in the last five minutes of the film reach what Nato, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world couldn't do in five years: they capture the war criminal and then hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for just revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to go to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Hague for the crime against the logic of cinema.
The purpose of the film is deeply human.
He intends to make it clear that Karajics and Mladic are still at large and suspect the Americans and the French (in this they are supposedly still exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution intensively enough because of secret political deals.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this, the poet writes about the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I stare at the bulging vein on his temple, which tells us how tiring it is to be bad."
Films like "Hunting" have the same oversized, human-head masks, but they show how tiring it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were ugly failures.
We can add that there has not been a single good film about South Africa yet.
It's almost always valid: If a star wanders around the world's crisis or minefields, it's like "The Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood was able to make a good film about the Holocaust with the "Schindler's List" film.
Some films are probably still worth it - because the classic works about the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett", were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it is possible that today, when all the mass killings come to our homes in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the world’s conflicts.
And that deprives screenwriters of the ignorance of reality that would be needed to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The dictator" were so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't try to be good if you want to make a good movie.
Perhaps we need to take a sarcastically distant artistic view of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprisre-lexicon" and the Balkan war, he replied: "It depends only on the fact that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust has been criticized for canceling the Olympics.
The mayor's separation from Hamburg's application for the Summer Olympic Games provoked fierce criticism in political and economic life.
Many people want to continue to fight for water games.
Von Beust, however, strongly warns of reality during the odds.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz called the withdrawal "unfavorable for the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we would not be able to keep the momentum of sport policy evenly."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative that "starts from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted that Hamburg's ambitions for the Olympic Games were not realistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides on the Olympic bid, it's the German Olympic Sports Federation," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sport Association's decision to apply for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Munich, which was expected in early December.
“For us, giving preference to this means that we will not have a realistic chance in the period up to 2028 that we have thought of so far.”
But we will not give up the dream, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) regretted von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg has no intention of applying for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to miss an opportunity to bury our plans now,” HSB President Günter Plos said on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement made by the President of the Senate at the reception held at the General German College Sports Association General Assembly.
There, the tender submitted to the city of Von Beust Hamburg for the 2015 Universiade described it as not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The SPD's civilian faction accused the Senate of leaving valuable time unused for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted for the Olympics and ignored housing," said two SPD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to spearhead the integrated plan for Olympic and subsequent housing use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The competition for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was very enthusiastic in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
Anyone who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden crates is thinking of Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes listed in this are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes a few months ago, the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now reached a sobering result: The six "Brillo Box" copies donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hulten, former museum director in 1995 - and most likely the round hundred more "Stockholm types" in the international art market.
The history is a confusing chain of long and complicated artistic and board stunts.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxes" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition of his works held in Moderna Museet in 1968, hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited with Warhol's consent: they did not come from Warhol (for cost savings reasons), but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't about works of art, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol granted permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about fifteen crates that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm type" rightfully entered the history of art and auction.
Some of them were auctioned off for over $100,000.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hulten, the legendary museum director, later falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden crates were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol left to him.
In fact, Hulten's 105 crates were only manufactured in Malmo in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
In addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, chief memorialist of Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish private boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first ground and sanded, and then the white oil paint was applied with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 shows that the paint was applied directly to the chipboard with a paint roller without foundation - and it is not even an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These boxes are not authenticated by the artist, so they should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
The Authentication Board, of course, announced in June that it would investigate the "serious accusations" of soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been enveloped in inexorable silence.
Manila's Rebel Soldiers Surrender
The rebellion was abandoned in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, said Antonio Trillanes, the leader of the hotel, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Before that, government loyal soldiers using tear gas stormed the hotel.
Two dozen soldiers have been barricaded in the building for hours.
Half of the team was on trial on Thursday for the failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly unravel 30 sympathizers.
The military police in charge of guarding the man obviously switched to him and joined the mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have sealed off the high-end hotel area.
The president called the security cabinet to an emergency meeting.
Security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' proceedings.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, former commander of the Scout Rangers, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march in a short time.
Critics called for a strong protest against the president on Friday.
His government has been overshadowed by corruption charges for several months.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of its attempt to mutiny against Arroyo, organized by 200 members of the army in 2003.
After less than 24 hours, the uprising failed when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will be a major shareholder in Versatel
United Internet has secured more than a 20% stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company said the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
This represents 20.05 percent ownership of the share capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of increasing the shareholding in Versatel remains open.
This move is intended to help consolidate the German DSL market, United Internet said.
On Wednesday, Berenberg Bank raised its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The financial institution reserves the share only to a third party, rumored in the financial market.
On the previous day, the United Internet had already owned a narrow 10 percent of the Drillisch mobile phone company.
Within the framework of a capital increase, Drillisch has issued 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies initiated a dialogue on cooperation on the market launch of DSL and mobile phone products.
“We will strengthen our partnership,” a United-Internet spokesperson said.
The two companies jointly founded the MSP joint venture to take over the competing Freenet.
The two companies will initially be satisfied with a good ten percent stake in Freenet and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
However, the two companies will leave all options open, especially with regard to the increase in the shareholding in Freenet AG.
Negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.
The poker game around Freenet has been going on for months and is now part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1.27 million DSL and fixed access customers.
The holding company, formed by United Internet and Drillisch, had a direct stake of 6.01 percent in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will bring in an additional 4%.
The acquisition of 18.49 percent of the Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
