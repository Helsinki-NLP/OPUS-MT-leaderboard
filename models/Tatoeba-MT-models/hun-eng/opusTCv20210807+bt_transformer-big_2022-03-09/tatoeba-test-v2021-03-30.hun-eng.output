If you'd stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
Of course.
What you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the safe.

Who's gonna do it?
Tom should have done it sooner.

I loved that show.
I'll stay if it rains.
He told us a story about a boy named Tom Sawyer.
Tom can get away.
Anyone who doesn't drink in a company is either a thief or a spion.
That's cheating.
This moment should never end.
He was paroled yesterday.
- Can I see your ticket?
Please give him my best regards.
Tom couldn't open the safe.
Say that in Hungarian.
Access only for staff.
Tom has made some progress.
Where can we meet?

Tom should have listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the inconvenience she caused.
I'll apologize later.
I noticed you were wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.

I need to see him.
Don't leave me.
I could really use some coffee.
There are many flowers in the garden.
Tom laughed too loud.
The answer was simple.
You shouldn't have come so early.

He didn't just yell at me, he yelled at my dog.
Tom's careless.
I'm really sorry, I seem to have lost your umbrella.

Sorry about last night.
It's time to say goodbye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It's happened to me several times.
The trees are budding.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
Maybe it's a trap.
Remind him to come home early.
Tom had breakfast.
We only have enough food and water for three days.

Why are you spitting?
He returned home after ten months of absence.

What is the exchange rate today?
I think he's leaving.
Let's take a break.
It's a shame to run, but it's useful.
Sooner or later you will get used to the heat.
I dunno.
They offered it to me.
That's unusual.
Capitalism does not force people to buy.
He was shaking with horror at this terrible scene.
It's not up to me what happens.
I don't feel like arguing.
That bike is too small for you.
Tom gave everything to Mary.
Keep trying.
Cook an egg.
