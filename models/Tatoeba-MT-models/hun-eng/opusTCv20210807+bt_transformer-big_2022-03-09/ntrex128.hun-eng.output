Members of the National Assembly of Wales fear finding themselves on the Muppet Show
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their address to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after the National Assembly (Assembly) was called the Welsh Parliament.
Now, representatives of different political backgrounds are all afraid that the new title will make them a laughing stock.
According to one Labour MP, his faction is concerned that their new name will rhyme with "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for the sake of our Welsh readers: in Welsh, twp means simple and pwp means poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the entire faction is "dissatisfied" and therefore proposes alternatives.
One conservative representative said that his faction was "open" to the change of name, however, he noted that MWP was just a jump from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as "u" in Yorkshire English, i.e. MWP is pronounced "map".
The National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the change of name is: "The final decision on the titles of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The 2017 law governing the government of Wales allowed the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation proposing the inclusion of the name of the Welsh Parliament, which received broad support.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission prefers the title Welsh Parliament Member (Member of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation preferred the MWP alternative.
Members are coming up with new alternatives, but the agreement is rather difficult, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit the bill on name changes in the coming weeks.
The law on reforms will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and the structures of the Commission.
Members will be able to cast their final vote on the issue of their own title during the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing country's name
On Sunday, citizens vote on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to decades of debate with neighbouring Greece, one of whose provinces is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long said that its northern neighbour's name is essentially a territorial claim and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO admission.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the change of name and thus does not participate in it.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is simply a compromise that they have to make for their accession to the EU and NATO.
Harlem churches in difficult conditions, the bells of St. Martin also fell silent
“In the past, I’ve heard older people say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“None of them today.”
As you say, the disappearance of the bars would be understandable.
“People go out in different ways these days,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the communal living rooms that people go to every day.”
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that the sale of church property will not fulfill the hopes of the leaders, “and in time they will be back where they started.”
And the churches will be replaced, he adds, by residential buildings whose residential community will also not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy homes in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and this will further hasten the final closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments will join the community.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black city – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out of the church in the 1930s.
which was then taken over by a nearby black congregation.
The church of St. Martin was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the reverend is known for leading a boycott against his business owners who refuse to use black people or market black products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the bell ring as "the bells of the poor".
According to the expert who played the bell in July, this bell is “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell ring in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago joined the larger bell ring at Riverside Church.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't hire anyone to replace him.
In recent months, a complex situation has emerged in St. Martin with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, who have been involved partly in the secular management of the church and partly in the episcopal office.
In July, the governing body of the parish, the parish council, turned to the bishop's office in writing, objecting that the office would "pass the costs" to the council, even though the council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the office.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency around the office's house.
Shark attacks 13-year-old California boy while fishing for crabs
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy fishing for crabs on Saturday, the opening day of the crab season in California.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. on Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said on KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about half an hour ago on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy screaming for help.
At first, Hammel thought the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a crab, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“His shoulder was torn at his collarbone,” Hammel told him of what he saw when he got to the boy.
“I started screaming for everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water,’” he added.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
The species of shark attacking the boy is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told the press that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was then determined that it was not a species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also said that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours during the investigation and for safety reasons.
Giles said more than 135 shark species occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's to expand into UK beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert sellers and supermarket-style piperestands with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
As part of its growing growth in the British beauty market, with sales of fashion and household goods falling, the chain will test larger toiletries in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will appear in new stores from next year.
The strengthening of the piper line is due to the fact that stores are trying to fill the shelf surfaces previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items in different ways.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But former brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be placed in larger areas on brand stalls such as Boots and similar stores.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching the Boutique makeup family, in which most of the products are now vegan, as they are now being sought by more and more young customers.
Fragrance Shop is also testing its appearance at two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the other this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online shopping and the reorientation of food shopping habits to small local retailers, supermarkets need to make greater efforts to lure shoppers in.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says the supply will be more and more similar to that of convenience stores, as the chain tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and products other than food.
Since the acquisition of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened Argos classes and some Habitat classes in hundreds of stores – this step has also had a positive impact on food sales, making the acquisition even more profitable.
The supermarket chain's previous attempt to lift the wrinkles of beauty and medicine classes failed.
Sainsbury's started a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate over the distribution of the revenues of the drug classes in its stores ended it.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in its 281 stores to Celesio, which operates the Lloyds pharmacy chain, three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and will offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four stores, with brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “By transforming the look of our toiletries, we want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers.
We have also hired qualified staff to advise those interested.
Our range of brands caters to all needs, and the attractive environment and the conveniently accessible location provide a seductive force that takes the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones 'tomb shop' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal
Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones left after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound agreement on his lifestyle business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
The two celebrities' businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning’s 37-year-old presenter has announced on Instagram that he is quitting.
Holly Willoughby pulled the plug at Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when she left their promising lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her own highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones is a "tom shop" when, on Tuesday, at Jones's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, he announced during a tense discussion that he had no time left to devote to Truly, their joint brand of homewear and accessories, due to his new contracts of a total value of 1.5 million pounds.
The two celebrities' businesses were previously compared to the Goop brand listed by Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of ?11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island to go to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
He was going to deal with it in the long term, and that's what's going to make his living in the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, as the departure was so close.
In the Marlow office, the warehouse is full of goods to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning’s host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the business millions thanks to the massive amounts of money invested in the range from pillows and candles to clothing and home wear and possible slippages.
It could also be the end of an old friendship.
For ten years, the three-child host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over the presidency in March.
The two couples usually vacation together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the product face of M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We do not want to comment on [Jones’] business affairs.”
There were harsh words, "and then we fell in love."
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might consider "unpresidential" and for his positive statement about the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump allow so much?
Trump said in a funny "newscaster" voice.
- I didn't let you do anything."
He said Kim would be happy to meet for the second time after Trump welcomed the first talks in Singapore in June as a huge step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that, as his country sees it, there is no "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the United States will continue to maintain sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his campaign speech.
“Things are going great with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a very good relationship.”
As he said, his efforts to improve relations with Kim were promising positive results – the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Being president isn’t hard, but there’s not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there’s only about 200 people standing in front of me,” Trump said.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
Indonesia also rejected the help of international aid organisations after the earthquake in Lombardy.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to be evacuated, no national disaster was reported, which would be a prerequisite for the arrival of international assistance.
“In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, so our situation is a little difficult,” Sumbung said.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in the rescues on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian agencies are currently evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international aid agencies should be involved.
Despite the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the devastating power of nature extremely unprepared.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh Province, this is not common in other coasts.
Although there was a tsunami signal in place, the obvious lack of a tsunami alarm system in Palu also contributed to the disaster that claimed human lives.
Transport between Indonesian islands can be difficult even at the best of times.
In times of natural disasters, logistics are even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but it will be at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has placed the development of Indonesia's worn infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and has not spared costs in road and railway projects.
However, the Joko government is now struggling with budget deficits ahead of next year's elections.
In addition, the president has to face the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as Muslim majority members have begun to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be evacuated because of the riots, during which Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other heated weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge's huge equatorial goal against Chelsea
In the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge in London, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool with his 89th-minute goal, so they didn't lose to Chelsea.
His team lost 0 to 1 when Sturridge received an injection about 30 metres from Chelsea’s gate from Xherdan Shaqiri.
First he put the ball out to the left, then he started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high over the sixteenth and went towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball ended up in the net above Kepa Arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get in position because there’s always someone like Shaq who plays the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in the position as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming, and I just took him off, and then I didn’t think much about it, and I shot him.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after winning the lead with the goal of Belgian star player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blues passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with a corner, and then he managed to break away in the middle and rush into Liverpool's square.
After a quick injection, Kovacic started and got the ball back in the middle.
Then he started Hazard with a beautiful handover to the sixteenth.
Hazard ran the defense and ended up sending the ball with a left shot to the far corner at Liverpool gate near Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo arena in Naples as the next stop in the Champions League group matches.
Chelsea are playing against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA European League.
832 killed in Indonesia tsunami
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the local disaster management agency announced on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday and the six-metre high tsunami waves following it, several people were buried under the ruins, the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The streets of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, are covered with the ruins of fallen buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of the stabbed woman
Police are investigating a murder after a woman was found dead in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The body of the 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking people in the area to report anything they've seen or died.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, but I would like to ask everyone who was in Birkenhead near John Street to contact us.
I would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an onboard camera to contact us, because they may have relevant information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are still in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one could enter the building for the time being and no one could leave.
When he found out what had happened, the man couldn’t speak.
The residents of the building have been informed that it may be several hours before they can get back into the building.
One of the officers told someone that the whole building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was struggling with tears.
“It’s terrible,” he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police minibuses inside the cordon and another one outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone who has any information can write a message to the address ‘MerPolCC’, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous number 0800 555 111 and refer to file 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell statue is the latest victim of a history-rewriting fever
The exile of the statue may be poetic justice for Cromwell and his fanatical Puritan followers once destroyed England’s cultural and ecclesiastical heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
According to the Cromwell Society, however, Crick's proposal is "foolishness", an "experiment to rewrite history".
According to John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue before Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current debates on the removal of statues.
During the English Civil War, the destruction of images was not ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
Thus, another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell depiction reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure who is still to be celebrated by many today."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but many view him as a defender of parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this feud in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person who represents one side of this conflict.
And his achievements as Lord Protector are worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Wounded to Death by Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and wounded a farmer to death in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by his last name only as Yuan, was found covered in blood with a torn artery next to the pighouse in the Liupanshui city market in the province of Kujzhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to vaccinate pigs in a breeding facility in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China on 30 May 2005.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man’s body and discovered that the door to the neighboring pigsty was open.
According to him, the mouth of the giant boar in the pigsty was bloody.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mauled,” said a relative referred to by Guiyang Evening News as Wu.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pigsty on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig was blocked so that it could no longer harm others while the police were investigating the tracks at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although it does not occur often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig in Wales held a farmer in his tractor until his wife managed to scare him away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba said on CBC News that although pigs are generally not prone to attack, the taste of blood can make them aggressive.
“They are very playful.
Like little kids, they're very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
Heavy rains in the wake of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it reaches the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will continue to cause heavy rainfall in the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck at 140 km/h as a category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. east coast time on Sunday, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure zone is forming over the Pacific Ocean and heading west towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, as a tropical storm, it floods the southwestern parts of the United States with heavy tropical humidity.
The storm can bring rainfall of up to 25 cm to some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then the approaching tropical humidity will cause heavy rains in the coming days in the southwest.
Here, precipitation of 3 to 5 cm can cause sudden floods, floods full of debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can bring rainfalls of between 5 and 10 cm per hour, especially in the southern regions of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, precipitation is expected from 5 to 10 cm in some parts, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods may occur, with rapidly decreasing strength due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
During tropical rains, it is especially not recommended to walk in the desert.
Because of heavy rains, canyons can turn into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Up to 1.5 cm of precipitation is possible, which can cause minor floods and slippery road conditions full of debris.
This will be the first wet season in the region.
Scattered tropical showers can occur in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, and on Mondays during the day and Tuesdays the rainfall extends to wider areas.
The heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic air masses cool down, but tropicals will remain quite warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, the summer heat is expected to be felt again in larger areas.
It is expected to be warm in the central and eastern parts of the United States in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
According to long-term weather forecasts, temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States are likely to exceed average temperatures until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
A total of more than 20 million viewers on six television channels followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of rape in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate has not been resolved, and the broadcasters have had to interrupt the regular broadcast because of the last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has managed to get the FBI one week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was touching him at a high school party and trying to undress him.
Kavanaugh said in his passionate testimony that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The confessions were probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen has a hard time measuring the number of people watching the shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, so many viewers are the football finals or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, of all the channels, the Fox News Channel, featuring experts supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, had the highest number of viewers, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the whole day's hearing.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched 3.1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
Interest did not decrease after the hearing.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement that the senator was voting for Kavanaugh, he was on CNN and CBS on Friday morning as a loud crowd of protestors received him on the elevator to the court case committee meeting.
He stood there for minutes while the crowd scolded him, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman told the senator.
“Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?”
Others shouted to him: “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
Flake only said that his office issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share what he had to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting channels were then seen live hours later, as the committee voted on whether to submit Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for vote.
Flake, however, said that he would only be willing to do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate next week, as the minority Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced of the need for this by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake decided to talk to Coons and later with other senators.
Flake made good use of his power because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses Brexit opponents of playing politics
In a Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who opposed her plans to leave the European Union of threatening the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the interests of the nation.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper right next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU treat each other's customs is "absurd".
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested for manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
The police posted a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and it was also announced that Sims' glasses fell off during the fight.
The police found the glasses and Simpson's DNA at the scene, said on the WAFB channel of CBS' network.
After Simpson was questioned, the police announced that the young man admitted to shooting Sims.
According to Advocate's report, the court set bail at $350,000.
A preliminary report released Friday by the East Baton Rouge County coroner's office said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The office thanked Louisiana State Police for the help of the escaped criminals task force, the State Police Criminal Science Lab, the university police and residents in the area in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their "committed and persistent work to find the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-metre tall attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at LSU.
In the last season, Sims reached a 5.6-point and 2.6-point rebound average per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death "destroyed" and "shocked" the team.
“You’re always afraid of something like this happening,” Wade said.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After volcanic activity in the crater increased and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges took place in 24 hours, the National Disaster Prevention Center asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several rumblings and tremors.
In the pictures on the community portals, in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, the windscreens of cars are covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after a 7.1 earthquake shook the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on anniversary of independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's divisive break-up referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police who held them back, so the streets crowded with tourists were now covered with dense powder paint.
Later in the day, further fights broke out, during which the police tried to maintain order with a baton.
The pro-independence groups chanting the slogan "We will not forget, we will not forgive" and the pro-unit protesters lining up behind the slogan "Long Live Spain" stood against each other for hours.
According to the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the demonstrations.
Tensions continue to remain in the region steeped in independence aspirations following a referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted for separation by a huge majority, although the participation rate was quite low, as most of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year when police tried to stop voting at polling stations with aggressive clashes.
The pro-independence groups were on the street all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not eventually take the normal route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said there was no longer a chance for Catalonia to gain its independence.
“Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents crying tears of joy for us to vote, but now our case is dead."
Although the regional elections in December last year have managed to achieve an important, even narrow, victory, the Catalan pro-independence parties find it difficult to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their best-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are waiting for the court to give judgment on their role in the organisation of the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration with her phone, said the conflict was fired by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he says.
A Catalan leader, Oriol Junqueras, who has been in custody since last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
“The best way to reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government represents is to take part in the European elections as a candidate,” he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their car into the same house
Police have arrested a 33-year-old man, a 34-year-old man and a 39-year-old man who drove their car into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place around 19:30 British summer time at Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At any given moment, the car may even have been shot with a crossbow.
Livingston beat Rangers 1-0 with Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston's victory
Livingston, newly in first class, was a big surprise to the Rangers team by getting Steven Gerrard to lose his second defeat, who has been coaching the ibroxi club for 18 games.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference, because Gary Holt's team was in a dead race with the Hibernian team in second place.
So the Gerrards remain without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they face the first-place Hearts team, compared to whom they are eight points behind.
Before that, however, Rangers still have a match in the European League against Rapid Wien on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its division undefeated series to six victories, which means that Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet lost to the team.
Livingston missed many situations with the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal in the game, because their attack game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and then Alan Lithgow's attempt proved wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game because they were sure that they could disturb the guests in the fixed game situations.
The decisive goal was born from exactly such a situation.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in their defense, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of the sixteenth.
At this stage of the game, Rangers led in ball possession, but domestic protection continued to be unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was hardly in danger.
This trend continued during the second half of the match, except for one situation when Kelly had to defend herself against Alfredo Morelos' attack.
Scott Pittman's attempt was saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow missed another free kick from Livingston.
The transversal balls continued to arrive in Livingston's sixteenth, but the defenders avoided each time. Two punishments were not received by the attacking team: one by Halkett's entry against Glenn Middleton as a replacement player, and the other by hand.
“Fenomenál” game from Livingston – match analysis
From Tony Macaroni Arena reports Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston gave a phenomenal performance and took the credit.
The players were all excellent, and they exceeded expectations.
The members of the team and their style of play have hardly changed since they returned to the forefront, but Holt's efforts deserve great recognition, because the coach has really boosted the team since his arrival.
Several players have brought their finest form.
Halkett team captain played a huge role with his well-organized defense, and Menga sweated Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
The Rangers played without a clue.
No matter how well they sometimes perform under Gerrard's leadership, they're now unable to reach that level.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the home defense once anyway – so the Rangers have to pull themselves together quickly because they slipped back to the middle of the field.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany was marked by a pleasant atmosphere and cheerfulness on Saturday (29 September) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdogan's divisive visit to Germany with the aim of improving relations between NATO members.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated due to issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built, huge mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police banned the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters of the President appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of anti-Erdozan protesters, including many Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdozan's policy and the German government's decision to receive the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are a great example of the divisiveness of the president's policy, who is celebrated as a hero by some German citizens of Turkish origin, while others see the autocrat in him.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist crashed into a car and lost his life
A cyclist was killed when he collided with a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high traffic road in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he died at the scene.
The crash occurred just a few months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of Saturday’s accident.
According to the London police, the police are still working to identify the man so that they can notify the relatives.
As a result of the investigation, roadblocks and bus diversions make it difficult to travel, and the authorities advise drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a heavily guarded man's prison, the prison's board of directors said.
The riots began at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire, and they have not yet been contained.
In order to deal with the situation, the special forces called "Tornado" were sent to the scene.
The members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries that were treated at the scene.
A spokesman for the penitentiary organization said: “A specially trained prison guard team is handling the situation in Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and face further prison sentences."
The Long Lartin male penitentiary holds more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after one of the prisoners attacked him.
Last October, a special task force was also needed to help bring down a serious riot in which prisoners attacked prison staff with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (but the situation in drought-affected areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but this is what the state is expected to expect at the beginning of next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa sweep through the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as the southeastern parts of California and Utah; the alert also affects the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive on Monday night and bring heavy rains.
The Phoenix Meteorological Service tweeted: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within 200 miles of Phonenix in the form of tropical storms or depression!
Hurricane Katrina in 1967, for example, approached the border of AZ 40 miles away."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict a rainfall of between 50 and 100 mm, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (central areas of the Siklás Mountains, the Great Basin, etc.) precipitation is expected to be between 25 and 50 mm, but in some places it may fall to 100 mm.
The rain brought by Rosa can bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning floods, as the region is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods are a serious threat, some of the rains can have a beneficial effect on the southwestern regions with drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s land area is affected by at least extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” the report said.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the peninsula of Lower California, Mexico.
It will continue to be hurricane-strong and will move about 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land language in Mexico on Sunday morning, bringing wind of up to 137 km/h, and will be heading north at a speed of approximately 19 km/h.
The storm in the Pacific encounters colder currents and will lose its power.
Thus, it is expected to reach the shores of Mexico again as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the risk of floods.
"On average, rainfall can lead to rainfalls of between 70 and 150 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where rainfalls of up to 250 mm may occur," said the report.
Rosa then continues as a tropical storm across Mexico to the north before reaching Arizona’s border in the early hours of Tuesday morning, in the form of tropical depression, to sweep through Arizona to the southern regions of Utah on Tuesday night.
“The biggest threat from Rosa and her remains will be the extreme rain expected in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning floods and streams in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 4:00 a.m. local time, an injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, his condition is "stable".
According to police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset.
The authorities are asking the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone recording of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “had to suffer the malice and anger of the Democratic Party”
“If you vote for Judge Kavanaugh, you are voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, during Kavanaugh's candidacy, the Democratic Party "had to suffer malice and anger".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had committed sexual violence against her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood up for his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president said that "the Americans could see with their own eyes" that day Kavanaugh's "brilliant and fearless character".
“The votes in favour of Judge Kavanaugh are those of one of the finest legal experts of our time, who has an immaculate public service record,” Trump told supporters in West Virginia.
The president was secretly referring to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“We are only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not going personally, but I’m basically going, he said.
“I go everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the "resistance and obstruction" tactic.
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior Republican advisor told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake tsunami, death toll rising
Many were swept away by the flood and at least 384 people were killed when the huge waves reached the coast. The disaster was caused by a strong earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, local authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in Palu on Friday, when the waves nearly six meters (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, many were swept away and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami warning sounded yesterday, people simply stayed on the beach longer, didn’t run away immediately, and became victims of the waves,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Response Agency (BNPB), told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t just come on its own, it took cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before it reached the coast.
Some climbed to the top of trees to escape the flood, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
The aerial images of the disaster published by the agency show a number of destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, more aftershocks shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes were detected in an area of some 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s technology assessment and application agency (BPPT) said Friday’s earthquake released about 200 times more energy than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay, and the resulting geographical conditions could have strengthened the impact of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was "significant", thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims have been found among the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that the number of injured so far is 540 and another 29 people are being sought.
According to Nugroho's statement, on the coast 300 km (190 miles) from Palu, in the area called Donggala, the number of injured and the damage caused may be even greater, as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication is “completely paralyzed, no information can be obtained” about Donggala, Nugroho said.
“More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s staff and volunteers were on their way to the area affected by the disaster.
“The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse,” they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday about not informing the public about the tsunami that hit Palut, but according to the management, the waves reached the coast as soon as the alarm was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man trying to warn those on the street of the approaching tsunami with desperate cries from the upper floor of a building.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, bringing cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not yet been able to confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, making it harder for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The army used cargo planes to send relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but according to the authorities, the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was opened only to facilitate aid work and will be closed for all other purposes until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers set up in Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where employees found shelter under tent tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of the office, but on their way they encountered signs of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses,” he added.
- It's very bad."
While the relief teams began to prepare the emergency response work, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this area could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, all overseas aid, relief supplies and personnel can only be allowed into the country if the site of the disaster is declared a disaster area at national level.
That hasn't happened yet.
“The incident continues to be treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government admits that this is indeed a national disaster, we can allow international aid services to enter, but so far no announcement has been made."
On the second night after Friday’s quake and tsunami, Palun’s friends and family members continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape smuggles some light into the dark atmosphere of natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who was trapped in the ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which this time took place in Indonesia.
In addition to the missing, other students were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
“As a veteran paraglider, what happened is a great spiritual burden on me,” he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paragliders, he desperately tried for hours to reach the contestants who were attending the beach festival in Palu.
In addition to the messages, however, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue pipes.
“I think that means the messages could no longer be delivered,” he said.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cash machine at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee who was filling an ATM with cash at Newport on the Levee shopping mall, a Newport Police Department press release said.
The driver of the cash truck was emptying a ATM at the entertainment center and preparing to fill it with additional banknotes, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
A man “approached Brink’s employee from behind” while he was busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses saw several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement did not include the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information regarding the identity of the perpetrators can contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper's name changed to Yere
Kanye West, the rapper's name is Ye now.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: "The creature formerly called Kanye West."
For some time now, 41 - year - old West has been nicknamed Ye, and that was the title of his eighth album released in June.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she replaces Ariana Grande, who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons", said the producer of the show.
The new name is not only an abbreviation for the rapper's current artist name – according to previous revelations, it also has religious significance for West.
“I know that ‘Ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier when he spoke about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you and I am us and we are all one.
Kanye means the only one, and it became Ye, which represents the good in us, the bad, the confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he now prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former creative partner, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written in hyphens or capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promised never to use force against civilians on the upcoming 50th anniversary of student protests in the bloodbath.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Square that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of some 300 people when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – he gives students a monthly allowance and plans to establish additional free public universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education were the two main factors driving young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
US should double funding for AI solutions
As China becomes more active in research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and employee of artificial intelligence solutions, who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plans to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the U.S. and the next breakthrough in the field of AI is imminent,” Lee said.
Doubling research funding could also double the chances of the United States taking the next big step in artificial intelligence, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures. The company invested in one of China's most important AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player and later served as a board member of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of the technology competitions previously announced by the U.S. government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would be held because it would be possible to find new future shapers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get the government funding they need for their research, Lee said.
“It’s not China that steals scientific leaders, it’s big companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired several large university skulls to work in the field of AI.
According to Lee, changing immigration policy could also greatly help the U.S.'s efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically get a green card,” he said.
China's State Council announced its plan to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Science Fund provides support to academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Fund (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently spending $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which was planning to set up a national security AI committee, has not taken any further steps in the matter for months.
Macedonia to hold referendum on changing country's name
Macedonia's population voted in Sunday's referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia". This step would resolve a decades-long disagreement with Greece, which prevented the country from accepting its application for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, one of the provinces of which is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it claims Greek territory with the same name, so so far it has vetoed the country's NATO and EU membership.
In June, the two governments made a deal on the new name of the state, but according to national opponents, the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not participate in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether there would be a 50% participation rate for a valid referendum.
The question on the ballots is as follows: "Do you support the country's NATO and EU membership and accept the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev at the forefront, argue that this price is worth paying in order for Macedonia, as one of the countries ascended on the ruins of Yugoslavia, to have a chance of membership of the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that would mean a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have declared that they feel obliged to vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the state election committee, no irregularities were reported on the day of the vote until 13:00.
However, the turnout up to this point was only 16%, which was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (which ended up with 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children because we belong in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski (62), who cast his vote in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in favour of the name change in Strumica, a referendum on 30 September 2018 that would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, in front of the parliament building, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage as well as chairs and tents for boycotters of the referendum.
“We also support the country’s membership in NATO and the EU, but we would like to join with pride, with our heads held high, and not through the maid’s door,” Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can also turn to China or Russia as part of Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership could be expected to invest in Macedonia that a country with more than 20% unemployment is in great need.
“I think the majority will support our cause, because more than 80% of the country’s population is basically supporting EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after he cast his vote.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "insuring the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published by Macedonia’s political science research institute last Monday, 30-33% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, a participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
70% of those who want to vote say yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least one vote more than 50%.
The invalidation of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government, which came to power in May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, scores a goal by playing full Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took good care of Brighton's defense, so Manchester City won a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in England.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal as if it were the easiest thing in the world.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle as the first step of the attack, and
He got out in the open between the three Brighton defenders.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He dodged a defender and ran off several times when he got close to the Brighton sixteen.
Then it passed to Sterling on the left.
The English striker gave the ball back to Aguero, who finished the action with his right foot, hitting the right side of the Brighton night watchman Mathew Ryan's gate.
“Aguero has a leg problem,” Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he could play for 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, he scored at that time."
The initial advantage was gained by Sterling's action at the English championship.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero, on the Brighton side, got a great pass.
He launched a beautiful cross ball towards Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane played with the ball for a while before he started Sterling long.
For the battle of the blues, he could barely flick the ball into the gate before he slipped outside the baseline.
City will play next Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies
Since the Nationals team missed the opportunity to get into the afterseason, they had no reason to really exert themselves.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer can't wait to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opposing team still has a chance in the playoffs. Rockies have a one-game advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies secured at least one comforting place with their 5-2 victory against the Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still to be won.
“Despite the fact that we no longer stand a chance, we can stand up to them with the audience and the other team in Denver at their peak for the whole year.
Of course I want to be on the field like that!"
The Nationals team still has to choose the starting player for Sunday, but according to the news, Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
Scherzer, who took part in pitching practice on Thursday, will have his 34th starting pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right-handed player in Washington this season is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3.
Trump campaigning in West Virginia
The president also secretly referred to the situation around the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the greats, the greats – I am not running personally, but I am essentially running, which is why I go everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible, radical democratic groups are doing, they can see it with their own eyes.
They are truly determined and can use whatever means they can to regain power, malice and vileness can be seen.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample in order to have control, to have power, that's what they want, control and power, but we won't let ourselves be."
According to the president, the Democrats are using "resistance and obstruction".
“You’ve seen it all in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry and malicious and mean and lying.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to which he expressed the loud displeasure of the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
You leaked the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
He does not tolerate those who freely say what they think.
I was not at all surprised when, in my own party, Momentum activists decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour MPs to be told that they are not welcome just because we have said what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received similar treatment for her unwavering stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically, are precisely the issues that Jeremy also disagreed with the former leaders.
The Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East on Friday said that they wanted a "inclusive and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, these Friday night meetings were exactly the same.
Unfortunately, however, today the tone has changed, and the promise of a "more restrained, polite" policy has been forgotten, if ever.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have recently more and more expected me to turn my back on my individual opinion and take sides on things that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it be national security issues or the single European market.
After every public speech, regardless of what I actually said, they start blaming me on social media, demanding my replacement, criticizing the central policy, and telling me that I shouldn't even be a member of the Labour Party.
This isn't just happening to me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than many of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are usually confined to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to endure sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that attacks at this level have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
However, the reality is that we have renounced diversity, and with every "distrust" motion and every amendment to the electoral rules, the circle of those tolerated in the party is shrinking.
Over the years, many have advised me to hold back, not to be so outspoken, and then "everything will be fine".
That is not why I entered the political field.
32 years ago, as a student, I joined the Labour Party because I was outraged that the Thatcher government had so neglected schools that our classrooms were almost crumbling, and then I fought for better public care for the most needy, both as a local councillor and as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was clear to everyone what political positions I was taking and on what issues I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, my message is that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm not only families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and energy questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not to the members of Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of replacement or political intent will not deter me from acting in my own judgment and taking into account everyone's interests.

Ayr-Melrose 38-3: Ayr goes to the top undefeated
Two late attempts slightly modified the final result, but there is no doubt about the Ayr’s deserved victory in the most entertaining match of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Thanks to their unparalleled protection and superior use of position, the Hungarians and Coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
“We have had to meet a lot of challenges in our games so far, but we are still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, a Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr took advantage of his situations much better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, of which Frazier Climo scored a point, gave Ayr an advantage. Thanks to the yellow card lent to Scottish captain Rory Hughes by Warriors, Melrose could have made the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make it a point.
Climo sweated Ayr's defense with a penalty, just at halftime, and then scored a one-man experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-5 result for Ayr.
Melrose started strongly in the second half, selling Patrick Anderson's attempt at Baggot, reducing the team's disadvantage to five points.
Then the game stood for a long time, as Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and had to be removed from the field, and in the sequel Ayr continued to increase its advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose laurels were reaped with the help of Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to prevent Bruce Colvine's experiment in a dominant position, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team began to catch up again, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dismounting Climbo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touch down from the penalty line behind the Ayr attack team.
Climo sold it, which he repeated almost immediately after the start of the new year, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry forward for the fifth attempt at home.
The main character of Still Game has started a new career in the hospitality industry
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry: it turns out he's at the head of a restaurant management company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes together and in which he plays with his old comedian, Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the next ninth season will be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source from Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow's "blooming catering industry".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia’s landlocked country hopes the court will reopen access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol around the sailing-decorated naval command in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases proclaim the motto: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In the coastal Bolivia, the memories of the lost beach, which Chile took in a bloody conflict for resources in the 19th century, are still vivid, and there is a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting the final judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1st, five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the ball, which gives a spirit of belonging and peace to people who are looking forward to a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A lot of Bolivians are watching the decision of the International Court of Justice on projectors, hoping that the Hague Court will stand up for Bolivia, and after decades of rapsodical attitude, Chile will be obliged to sit at the negotiating table so Bolivia can have independent access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, Evo Morales, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, has much to lose with Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change the situation much if it were to be favourable to Bolivia.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to judge Chilean territories and has also stipulated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered less than six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
In addition, the last four years have not only not helped Bolivia's cause, but have even rejected it.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes”, Mr. Zárate explained.
“Because of Morales’s hostile rhetoric, the Chileans’ remaining goodwill has gone away.”
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue to negotiate at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate a dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated an ambassador since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that judicial decision-making was unusually fast.
Monday is an “exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile” and a chance for “both of them to come out of 139 years of conflict,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the maritime debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment gives us an opportunity to see that it is time to move beyond the past.”
North Korea: No nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho said his country would not be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rival countries in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to be able to resume the stalled nuclear talks more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
According to Ri, "I long to believe that the ongoing sanctions and the American obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean war will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's commitment to decommissioning the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, huge headgear appeared, which will soon appear in high-end stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the day, you don’t have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized headgear as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was welcomed with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical hats made a sensation on Instagram this summer, and the above fashion designers also put their attention-grabbing works on the runway.
Valentino’s most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a featherlike, wide flange and almost swallowed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories were precious watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple that were not really designed to keep a man’s head warm.
Thom Browne also came up with a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their mouths sewn together, and they reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces resembled a diving mask with a pipe and glasses, and another looked like a melting funnel ice cream.
If you get these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
According to the predictions of style analysts, huge caps may already be on their way to high-end clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow the path trodden by "La Bomba", a straw hat with a width of 60 cm that we have already seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the less practical hat conquering social sites presented another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the swimsuit model holding it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia tassels and a white leather grip on top, was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacquemus' 2019 spring/summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect huge hats and beach bags to appear in high-end clothing stores by next summer. The designer has created such an elemental effect that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education. In view of the recent outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed to 2018, which is only further strengthened by the individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30,000 students are already studying in institutions of this kind, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers, and what positions they hold as citizens of the world.
In an education sector where it is possible to design and implement tailor-made school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to prove to be popular and sought-after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
But if you speak his language, it goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder, because we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have achieved the best results from foreign languages.
68 percent of all students who studied a foreign language achieved a higher A degree (more than 85 percent).
According to data collected from the 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students received a higher grade of A from Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Spanish students reached grade A.
These results also confirm that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, languages have become as important as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Vocational Training found that 17% of employers said they found it difficult to fill vacancies due to a lack of language skills.
This shows that language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As more and more workplaces expect knowledge of foreign languages, language skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career path a person chooses, if he has studied a foreign language, he will gain a lifetime of persistent knowledge from which he will have a clear advantage.
Being able to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically gives a multi-lingual candidate a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents could not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent (15 percent).
It is therefore important to focus on the teaching of languages to children.
Speaking several languages, especially in developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children that gives them a better chance of applying for important jobs as adults.
In Scotland, different languages will be used in each school.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while many will teach languages such as Mandarin or Japanese that are expected to be of paramount importance to the UK by 2020.
Whatever your child’s area of interest, you will learn several optional languages at independent schools and will be trained by tutors who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that equips and equips them with the skills they will need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is not difficult to see that in the current global business environment, languages remain vital for the future of a country, and education must reflect this.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should rather be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer choice, diversity and quality education to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire – that's how it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron to debut with Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
It won't be long before fans who are eager to see LeBron James enter the field for the first time in the colors of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you'll spend on the field is still a question.
“More than one, and less than 48,” Walton wrote on the Lakers official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably only play for a limited time.
After a few days of training, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the preseason to be ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump will begin a long series of campaign events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of Trump’s five announced events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi, which support him.
Now that the vote confirming the candidate for the Supreme Court's vacant seat has been postponed, Trump is trying to raise support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress when the votes come in November.
When does Trump’s West Virginia event start tonight, and where can it be followed online?
Trump’s speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
You can also follow Trump’s West Virginia rally online via YouTube live stream.
Trump is also likely to be affected by his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing this week, which has proven particularly tense in light of the sexual harassment allegations, and the Senate’s affirmative vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary goal of the sudden increase in events is to help Republicans before the November elections.
Trump’s campaign adviser said the five events next week were “to activate voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they currently own in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“To have control of Congress is such a critical point in his political plans that the president is visiting as many states as possible. We are looking at a busy campaign period,” a campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight “can bring supporters from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania and even be included in the media coverage of Pittsburgh,” says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his Republican Senate candidate in West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to surveys, is not in a favourable position.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to personally intercede to do better in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team will fight full shoulder-width ahead of Sunday’s singles to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup needed the four matches on Saturday afternoon.
The pendulum of luck and momentum is a rather out-of-the-air sports concept, yet all players believe in it, mostly during competitions such as the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead and they only have four left, so we can say we have the ball,” said Jordan Spieth as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe still leads by four points, and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they have finally got a little tail wind and can draw encouragement from a number of things, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long and have both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the start to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His hollow victory cries became louder as he progressed with the circle, hit and equalized with a critical roll in the fourth match, so that he and Thomas were at a double disadvantage after two.
The final roll of the match at hole 15 resulted in a similar cry of joy, a kind that can make the viewer believe that all is not lost for the American team.
“You just have to dig deep and take care of your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s exactly what’s waiting for players.
Eighteen holes for a chance to leave a mark on your own.
Over the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair of the Ryder Cup, have been able to score more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe's strange but adorable pair has brought four out of four, and they seem to be able to make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not perform above par on Saturday afternoon, and on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning's last nine stages, they performed similarly.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and the audience who loudly supported them, they became the benchmark by Sunday, and no one is expected to secure Europe's victory on the Le Golf National track with the sun's receipt more than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best would be a win at the same time at different holes.
However, it is still too early to celebrate the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning four, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once and twice with two punches over the par in the first nine holes, the Spanish and the Swedish pushed them into a upturn from which they had no chance to climb out.
But on Sunday, there won't be anyone to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-game games are extremely fun to watch at close range thanks to the couple’s interactions. You can watch what advice you give, what you don’t give, and how your strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though many of them have missed it, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a good advantage after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 result against the United States.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair, winning two victories against the infirmary Tiger Woods, raising the difference to four points on the Le Golf National course.
Thomas Bj arn's European team, which is trying to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the ever-mistake American team during the morning four-ball matches, winning the series to 3-1.
America showed more resistance during the fours, bringing two games, but they still couldn't tell the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who are referred to as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup, which scored four points in four opening matches.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed pair in the four-ball player, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau to a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes even gleamed his talent, but he's already lost 19 of his 29 matches out of the four ball players and fours, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ballers, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson, and in the fours they defeated the pair of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third place in the world rankings.
However, Europe did not succeed all on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
Three-time defending champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it with two points on Saturday.
They won a painful 2&1 victory against the Spanish pair Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ballers, and later they returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team managed to come back from the four-point disadvantage in individual competitions, although Furyk's defending team had enough draw to hold the trophy.
However, after only being the second best for two days, a Sunday counterattack seems quite unrealistic.
There is no way that North Korea will unilaterally disarm if it does not trust its negotiating partner.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that maintaining sanctions has only increased mistrust of the United States, and there is no way that under these circumstances the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jongho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea took "significant and generous steps" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, shutting down nuclear testing sites and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, we don’t see any similar response from the Americans,” he said.
“In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and under these circumstances there is no way that we can unilaterally and firstly disarm.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment that Washington was resisting the idea of "staged" nuclear disarmament, which would receive North Korea's rewards for the steps taken so far, his statement seemed significant because he did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a US president in power and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, during which Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump guaranteed the integrity of North Korea.
North Korea is trying to make it official at the end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States believes that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
The United States has also not been subject to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increases the pressure with sanctions to impose its will on us, and it also protests against the possibility of declaring the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that we can be brought to our knees by sanctions is a dream of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that non-relief sanctions only increase our suspicions."
Ri did not mention that a second summit between Kim and Trump was planned, but the US President specifically mentioned it at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed that three meetings had taken place between Kim and the South Korean President, Mun Jein, in the last five months, and then added: “If the country involved in nuclear disarmament were South Korea, not the United States of America, then the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been in such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, Ri's speech differed dramatically from last year's when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, "the evil president", called Kim "the rocket man", who was on a suicide mission.
This year, at the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also noted that there is still much work to do and sanctions will remain until North Korea implements nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there was no time limit, i.e. “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the actions taken so far.
On the other hand, the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The sanctions of the Security Council must be adhered to unwaveringly until we have achieved actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri during the break of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
During the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States took "the necessary steps."
According to Mun, the "right steps" mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore and actions that could lead to the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taught to get enough rest.
A new subject at Harvard University this year encouraged students to sleep more, fighting against the increasingly popular macho culture of caffeine-fueled all-night learning.
One academic concluded that students at the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first such training in the USA, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He encouraged the development of the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I just facing this now as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
During the course, which was first launched this year, students will be introduced to the fundamental impact of proper sleep habits on their academic and sports performance, in addition to having a positive impact on their general well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of the university's health service, the university decided to start the course because during the week the students were found to be extremely sleepless.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and why bedtime routines are important.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They present a map of the university area with interactive icons to encourage participants to rethink their daily routine.
“We know we’re not going to change student behavior right away.
But we believe they have a right to this knowledge, just as they have a right to be aware of the health effects of smoking,” said Professor Czeisler.
A culture in which it is considered an achievement to study a night continues to flourish, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students result in increasing problems of sleeplessness.
Sufficient and quality sleep protects students from stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain to starve and causes a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year he took one of the professor's courses as a freshman at Harvard.
He said that what he heard there opened his eyes and encouraged him to defend the launch of a university-level training.
He hopes that, as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before entering the private sector.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning for going to bed, a wake-up call for waking up, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily dissuade them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb led Steven Gerrard's team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibroxians tried to win their first alien victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team as manager in 18 matches. Thus, they are eight points behind the first place winner of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' unmotivated team didn't even get close to equalizing.
While the Rangers slipped down to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third, just because of the goal difference, falling behind the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face further difficulties after the beach marker Calum Spence’s head injury required medical attention thanks to an object likely dropped from the guests’ stands.
Gerrard changed eight points on the team that got into the semifinal of the Betfred Cup by sweeping the Ayr.
Holt, however, entered the field with the same 11 men who took a point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team drown his opponent's game where he could.
Although the Rangers led the ball, Livingston did more with what they got.
They could have scored in the first two minutes when Menga launched Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
Keaghan Jacobs landed a low free kick on Team Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved a penalty at the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers were only able to shoot at two first half gates, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little problem with the head of Laza Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livi's attempt in the 34th minute went against the game's previous course, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, just for their hard work.
The Rangers have once again missed a ziccer forced by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball into Scott Robinson, who found Menga great for an easy finish.
Gerrard decided during the break, replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this almost immediately affected the game when he teased the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, who brought an impressive form, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to make it possible for him to play a game that was right for him, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls one by one.
Holt's team could have taken a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net and took Jacobs' position before Lithgow lost his head from a corner.
Glenn Middleton, who replaced the Rangers, tried to fight another 11 when he got into a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson still couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: inventor of the Geiger counter
An excerpt from our "Sunday breakfast" almanach: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... the day the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that could have led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been one of the basic tools of science ever since, and thanks to the film "Bells of Coronado" (Coronado bells) featuring strange cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in 1950, it has become part of pop culture:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter. It can be used to look for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms being emitted because of the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen, it's bouncing."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in his invention bearing his name.
New vaccine against cancer may teach immune system to ‘see’ abnormal cells
New Vaccine Against Cancer May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ and Destroy Abnormal Cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment teaches the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
Thus, they are able to “see” the protein that accompanies many types of cancer.
An experimental vaccine has produced promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
Part of the method is the extraction of immune cells from the patient; their modification in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is a common accompaniment of several cancers; and then the replanting of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on highlighting immune cells and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells, has already been successfully used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West's SNL performance, wearing a MAGA cap, culminated in a pro-Trump abusive tirade.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was whistled in the studio of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent statement in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would apply for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in Make America's Great Again hat, he began to speak against the Democrats and re-emphasized his support for Trump.
“A lot of times when I talk to someone who is white, they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
“If I was interested in racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn't on the air, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading.
West even complained to the audience that he was being picked on behind the scenes for his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
I'm intimidated!
And they said I was in the sunken place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman cape, because that means they can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His manifestations were accompanied at least twice by whistles from the audience, and the characters of SNL apparently felt embarrassed by one of the eyewitnesses to Variety: “The whole studio was covered in silence.”
West was invited at the last minute instead of singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West raised questions when he performed his song I Love it dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, in a tweet: “One of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR SEMBING WITH THE MASS.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply "himself, and that's great".
“But I have decided not to reward someone (by buying his music or his fashions or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe holds and propagates an ideology that is harmful to the community to which I belong.
He's free.
“We did too,” he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is “the creature previously known as Kanye West.”
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and he followed in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P. Diddy.
His rap partner Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast restaurant knifer charged with attempted murder
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police statement, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive masculinity harmful
Kit Harington is best known as Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent fantasy series set in the Middle Ages, he often grabs a sword.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke up against stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that in view of such heroes, little boys often feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
In a statement to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thought "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the harmful effect of excessive masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star, who recently married her 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie, said she thought it would be very important to remedy the problem.
“I am personally deeply concerned about this case – how is the representation of masculinity so distorted?” the actor asked.
“What did we teach men as children about the problem we face now?”
According to Kit, television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculinity, since the shows often feature very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is it that we are born with, and what is it that we learn?
What does the street and the TV say to young boys that makes them feel like that's the only way to be a man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
It is clear that there is something wrong with young men.”
Kit stated in the interview that after the end of the summer season of the series, he would not be in Game of Thrones history series or sequels, because "he is fed up with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play a leading role in the recycling of Sam Shepard's True West film about a producer and his robber brother.
The actor said that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife, Rose, who he met while making the show.
“I met my wife on set, so I owe my future family and my life ahead of me to the show,” Kit said.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: 14% increase in new patients in China
China announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS in the country has increased by 14%.
According to health officials, this means more than 820,000 people affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by about 40,000.
Compared to the previous ones, it is a change that the vast majority of newly infected people catch the disease sexually.
The disease had previously spread rapidly by transfusing infected blood in parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province said that the number of such cases has since fallen to nearly zero.
Despite this, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-70% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the disease spreads because of inadequate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of a program to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members leaked Republican senators' data and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that a member of her staff had published personal data of three Republican senators on the senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, the claims in question were spread by "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The information allegedly contained the addresses and telephone numbers of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday. The person who published it is unknown, but it is certain that they were published from the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh on sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the source IP address is linked to Waters' office and data on a member of Waters' staff has been reported, writes The Hill.
“These allegations are completely unfounded, false and obviously false,” Waters continued.
– My staff member is not responsible for any leak of information. However, his right to anonymity, protection of his personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Among the critics were Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary.
“It’s an angry denial,” Fleischer wrote.
Waters does not seem to have the temperament necessary for the office of a Member.
If someone is accused of something he didn't do, he can't react angryly.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Waters' reaction seemed to be compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Waters said in his statement that his office had notified the "appropriate authorities and law enforcement" of the false charges.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are made known,” Waters continued, “and that they are held legally responsible for any act that endangers or damages any member of my staff.”
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's lame spy comedy
Today it has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception to this franchise under the name Johnny English, which can be classified as an action comedy/parody, the first part of which, Johnny English in 2003, the second part of Johnny English was reloaded in 2011.
Will the British nation become a new export product of sarcastic, self-parodic satyrs, in which we make fun of our own obvious lameness?
What is certain is that Johnny English had enough ammunition for another return – it is clear from his name that this comic character was created so that the crowds of viewers in the cinemas of non-English-speaking countries of the world could laugh at him.
Johnny English is, of course, a loony secret agent who thinks he's charming with his bizarre manners, so he reminds me a little of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the theme song of the Fire Wheels at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial and left chaos everywhere.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved how Johnny English, dressed in medieval armor, approached a helicopter, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comic vein prevails in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it even seems unnecessary, since nowadays "serious" franchises such as James Bond films or Mission Impossible series also bravely touch the tool of humor.
It feels like the humor of the film is more aimed at children, and for me, Johnny English's crazy, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings to the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network's top-secret online network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the horror of the on-duty agent Kevin Eldon, who, unfortunately, only got such a small role in the film.
This could be the final nail in the coffin of the conceited and divisive prime minister, whose political popularity is already in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically playing Theresa May and making everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors will outline to him that since the identity of all active agents has been revealed, he will have to put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent, of course, is the clumsy Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher at a prestigious school since his retirement, but, by way of derogation from the curriculum, teaches children to spy – of course, there are funny scenes here, while English describes the basics of espionage in a "Rocksuli" way.
English is quickly transported to Whitehall, where at the emergency briefing he meets his former long-suffering armor carrier, Bough, who is still being played by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married ever since, and he has married the captain of a submarine who always talks to his ears – the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
So the two-handed "Batman and Robin" pair of His Majesty's National Security Service will take action again and confront Ophelia Bulletova, played by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko, as a real woman of destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly ensnared by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy plays him.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, then smuggle themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in the midst of an amazing commotion, and English really releases hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-headset.
We need these stations to get to the end, but as cheerful and twisted as it is, it may give the impression of a children's film a little too much.
The end result is pretty mediocre.
As with all the other Johnny English films, the question is, can't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
UK Labour denies plans to introduce a four-day working week while paying UK workers a five-day wage
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day work week, all with employees working for five days' wages.
The party said it wants workers to benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees extra days off thanks to increased revenue.
According to the plan, employees would be given a three-day weekend while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would fit into the party's economic programme, which aims to tip the balance sheet on the side of the workers in the country.
The idea of the four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, so workers could benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is a vision that fits well into the party's program to tilt the balance towards the workers in the economy, and it also fits into the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned with the promise of a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: “The four-day working week is not one of the policies supported by the party, and the issue is not even on the agenda.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell presented his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour Party conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless directors" and utility companies.
If the plans of the shadow minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water companies would not receive the full profits they deserve, as a Labour government would make "deductions" as a punishment for the alleged harmful activities.
McDonnell also confirmed that he planned to make workers a member of the board of directors and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, who could thus obtain a dividend of 500 pounds a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election to the Supreme Court will be held at least a week later than the original date.
In an interview with "60 Minutes" on Sunday, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“That’s what I said before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges were filed, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His response was firm and clear.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete-proof.
“I’ve already made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and I would need extremely serious charges to change my mind,” Graham said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know Brett strongly denied the allegations,” Graham said.
And none of the people named by Dr. Ford confirmed the allegations.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don’t think anything new will come out.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and have you managed to reduce poverty?
The annual Global Citizen Festival begins in New York on Saturday. The festival features world stars to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival is now being held for the seventh time, with tens of thousands expected to fill Central Park's Great Lawn, where participants can not only enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international advocacy group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets to the concert (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets) can be given to those who undertake certain tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, e-mailing a leading politician, a phone call or any other meaningful activity to draw attention to the aim of the project: the eradication of poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen really been over the last 12 years in achieving its goals?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concert tickets in order to convince others of the importance of action, or is it just another form of so-called "clicktivism" when people feel that they have made a meaningful contribution to a case by signing or writing an online petition on Twitter?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by project supporters, which have served a number of different purposes.
According to the organization, these actions have helped world leaders allocate $37 billion to anti-poverty policies and commitments that could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that they were derived from their actions, of which $10 billion had already been paid or collected during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money raised has already directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and contractors aimed at "helping children reach their potential". The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can banish social injustice and malnutrition as footnotes in the history books,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that after asking the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and their children in more than 5,000 actions, the government has earmarked funds for the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the nutrition of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions posted on the Global Citizen website is “Why do you think extreme poverty can be eliminated?”.
According to the Global Citizen: “It will be a long and difficult journey, where we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like the previous civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we will achieve our goal because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year's New York event, and the hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Secretary: U.S. Navy to Use ‘Blockad’ to Obstruct Russian Energy Exports
“If necessary, Washington would even use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, such as Russian energy from reaching the Middle East,” said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Home Secretary.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, especially as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is just an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they’re in the Middle East only because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America, with its navy, can ensure that the sea routes are open and can block them if necessary, so it can make sure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance – the non-profit group defines itself as the "sound of energy consumers" in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
“Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in much the same way: by using existing energy sources and introducing new ones,” Zinke said, referring to Russia as a “one-dimensional economy,” pointing to the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump administration's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, pushing Russia out of the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, the senior officials of the Trump government, including the President himself, are convincing Germany to back out from behind the "wrong" pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a "hostage".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles existing capacity, is an economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so fiercely opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is a manifestation of unfair competition.
“I assume we share the same view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans backfired, as Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to distance itself from the bilateral treaties between Berlin and Moscow.
“I find it problematic when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI), said after the last meeting between Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren 'seriously considering' running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren on Saturday said she was “seriously considering” running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed at a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and put in place a dysfunctional government, and it’s time for a woman to be president,” Warren said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.”
At the city meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said that he thought he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
“I am watching with grave concern what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” Warren said.
Warren outspokenly criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court candidate.
In a Twitter message on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, according to a poll published on Thursday, most of Warren's Massachusetts voters do not think Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the University of Suffolk Political Analysis Center and the Boston Globe, 58% of Massachusetts voters who voted for Warren said that the senator should not run for president, while
32% support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, Deval Patrick's former governor's candidacy would be supported by the majority of the respondents, 38%, and 48% would oppose it.
The 2020 presidential election included the names of high-ranking Democratic politicians such as former Vice President Joe Biden or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will decide whether to run until January.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after applying in September
He was arrested on Monday on charges of domestic violence.
“What my son is going through, what he has been going through since he returned home, I understand the other families who are experiencing the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds with which our soldiers are returning home,” Sarah Palin told the audience at Donald Trump’s meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his son’s arrest “the elephant in the room” and said that his son, like other war veterans, “returned changed, hardened, and constantly wondered if they had enough respect for the service that their comrades, pilots, and all other members of the army had done for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police, said that Track Palin was also reported to have committed domestic violence with a gun and drunk.
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support judicial review of asylum policy
18 member states and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of a new U.S. asylum policy that prevents asylum seekers fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 different states, as well as Washington, D.C., wrote an expert letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is attacking policy in court, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions case, initiated by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been made public.
The plaintiff claimed that she was abused by her partner and “the sons of a violent gang”, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's being held in Texas.
Prosecutors in the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications to the United States come from, because in these countries there is a constant problem of domestic violence committed by criminal gangs.
The new U.S. refugee policy withdrew a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA), under which undocumented immigrants could apply for asylum fleeing domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of Washington, D.C., stated in a Friday communication that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be evaluated in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the case, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the letter said.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that immigration-rejecting policy is harmful to the US economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “fill the lowest levels of jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and criminal gangs.
“The right to asylum is granted to a person who leaves his country because of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution,” Sessions said on 11 June when announcing the policy.
Asylum is not designed to solve all the daily problems of people around the world, no matter how serious they may be.
A desperate rescue operation in Palu, the number of dead has doubled, rescue teams are racing against time
The situation of the survivors is getting worse.
“Everyone is very tense,” says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she calms her febrile son in a disaster-stricken Palu evacuation center.
Paramedics are bringing the bodies in every minute.
We don't have any drinking water."
Some residents returned to their destroyed homes to rescue what could still be saved from the wet things.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals, which have also been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake, cannot provide care to people.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palu Military Hospital. Patients were treated outside the hospital building for high-strength aftershocks.
The man’s eyes filled with tears when he recalled how the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he and his wife and daughter were staying, trembled into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
“I think I’m stuck in the collapsed walls,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to him and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Harassing the Country with Propaganda Advertisements
The U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the U.S. press. This was a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that stressed the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade relations.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to his ad in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper sold, while accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on 6 November. China denies the charge.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections is, according to some US officials who have spoken to Reuters, a new stage in Washington’s increasingly strong action against China, aimed at putting China under pressure.
Although it is not uncommon for foreign governments to promote trade with their country through advertising, Beijing and Washington are engaged in an increasing trade war in which they impose more and more tariffs on each other's imports.
According to American and Chinese experts, at the beginning of the trade war, the Chinese's response duties were aimed at exporters of states in which Trump and the Republican Party were popular, such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses because the state of Iowa exports significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in his opinion article in the Sunday Des Moines Register: “China is further exasperating our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of speech and the press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“But if you go to a newspaper vendor in Beijing, you can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not at all reflect the different, different views of the Chinese people on the growing growth prospects of the Chinese economy, since the media are under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party.”
Branstad added that “one of China’s most prestigious newspapers refused to publish” his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans could alienate female voters with Kavanaugh scandal before midterm elections
Analysts say it may backfire that many high-ranking Republican politicians are defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, especially losing the support of female voters before the mid-term elections.
The incident provoked intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow and in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, a progressive group, told a Washington, D.C., newspaper on Friday.
According to Mic's report, on Friday morning, some protestors in the Senate corridor chanted, "November is coming!" because the Republican-controlled Justice Committee, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be tremendous,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“A lot of people say it’s already been very high, and that’s true.
But it can be even higher, especially among insecure female voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29-year-olds), who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not vote."
Analysts even assumed before Ford's public testimony that he could strike back at Republicans if they continued to stand for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Since then, Ford has described in detail why he accuses the Supreme Court candidate of sexual harassment.
“The Republican Party is on the wrong footing,” former President of the Republican National Committee Michael Steele told NBC News earlier this week.
“This is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, but also about how the Republicans handled the matter and how they behaved with Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which supports the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are quite divided as to whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents fully or more believed Ford's testimony, and 35% of Kavanaugh's respondents gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30% of Ford respondents believed that.
As a result of Flake's motion, the FBI is currently investigating the credibility of Ford's claims, as well as the claims of another accuser of Kavanaugh, Deborah Ramirez, writes the Guardian.
A week ago, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh was drunk and harassing him at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the World Wide Web would launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access each information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "to gain control of the world".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse", also known as POD.
It can include lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available from the same browser at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal online data repository is that the user can fully decide who can access his data.
The company calls this "implementation of the right of individuals to self-determination over data".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the company's task is to provide resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers working in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask "Facebook and Google to introduce the whole change-making technology that would turn the business models of companies completely upside down overnight."
“We don’t ask permission from them.”
Berners-Lee said: “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid grid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the University of Technology in Massachusetts.
Berners-Lee has been an important opinion-maker in recent months in the debates surrounding the neutrality of the Internet.
Despite the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the World Wide Web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann, First World War viktória
The only Anglican minister who received the Victoria Cross is celebrated by his hometown 100 years after his heroic act in World War I.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel earned the medal during the attacks in Bellenglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, so he could never know that he had earned the highest honor of the British armed forces.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two grandchildren at the Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the memorial stone was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deserving act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel on 29 September 1918 "in the midst of thick fog and heavy gunfire and machine gunfire".
Later, he hurried to the front line and took the lead in the battalion with “exceptional heroism”, and then alone attacked a camp cannon task force, destroying three of its members.
Reverend and Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
“I know I can never live up to what my grandfather did, and that taught me humility,” Vann said.
After the parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, wreathed the memorial stone.
Michael Vann said that he was honored to play a role at the ceremony and added: “The valour of a real hero is demonstrated by the number of people who later pay their respects to him.”
MMA Fans Watched All Night to Watch Bellator 206, Instead Received Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been up all night watching the exciting Bellator 206, and the broadcast is cancelled.
The San José show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night as part of the main competition show in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, to the surprise of the audience in England, Peppa pig was on the show instead of the game.
This was resented by many who stayed up until the morning hours because of this clash.
Instead of the MMA game, one of the fans called it a "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
“According to state regulations, at 6 a.m., such content could no longer be broadcast by the network, so they had to switch to children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of communications and marketing at Bellator.
“This is Peppa, the pig’s time.”
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, promised that in the future the schedule of the show would be revised to take into account UK viewers.
“I think we can definitely solve it with repetition,” Coker said.
However, since it is 6 a.m. there on Sunday, until Sunday of our time, which is already Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show switched, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But it wasn't about that. We had a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
There will be only five matches in the program instead of six so far – we really wanted to please the audience, but we accounted for ourselves.
It was an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, a diver at the Olympics, said that when he was young, he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that's how he got the motivation to be successful.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he did not realize that “not everyone is like him. ”
On Radio 4's radio show Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said that she stood up for gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he has been much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-lived show, Kirsty Young, missed several months because of illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley said that as a young man, he felt "less" than anyone else, because "socially it was not accepted if someone loved boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and difference that gives me perseverance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth “something” so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia, has asked the world's governments to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to live his life openly without negative consequences and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said that he was “totally surprised” when he fell in love with another man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter 20 years older than him got married last year, and he claims that the age difference was never a problem between them.
"If you're going through so much when you're young," he said, "you were at your first Olympics when you were 14 and your father died of cancer three years later," then it's hard for you to find someone of your own age who has experienced similar extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley admitted that this completely upset his attitude to the world.
“If you asked me that question last year, I would have said the most important thing is to win a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what I realized? There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child's name was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I couldn’t accept that my father wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I’ve dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of an audience at the Olympic Games at home, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
Heather Small Proud (Proud) helped her a lot during the Olympic preparation, and to this day she gets goose bumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape and benched at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson can set a record by attending his 47th cup game at the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson plays for the 12th time as a record at the biennial event, but due to his performance at Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches, Team Captain Jim Furyk sent him to the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events in the big tournaments, like so many times when you had to fight for the victory of the United States, now you're rooting for your team in one half of the day, spending the other half practicing on the field and trying to correct the mistakes that weaken your game.
He was never one of the most accurate bats at the top of his career, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the narrow track of Le Golf National, where high grass makes him pay a very high price for faulty punches.
And if the track isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the exacting English champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who won all four games on the starting Tommy Fleetwood team this week.
If the Americans who start with a four-point disadvantage before the 12 individual matches start strongly, then Mickelson's match can be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in today’s development. He patted me on the back, put his arms around me and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
– Extremely confident.
He is one of the biggest and has done a lot for the team in the past and in the past week.
Basically, I didn't give him two games.
I planned more, but in the given situation, we decided that this was the best solution.
He wants to be on the track, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson on Sunday, he's going to break Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games at the Ryder Cup.
By doing so, you can close a series at the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven drawes, but Furyk pointed out that the presence of the veteran player does not bring tangible benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with others, he's a great team member," he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the games against him and it’s good to see that.
His presence goes beyond playing in a strict sense."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows they can easily lose the advantage they have gained.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjarn, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, they can easily turn their back on him.
The Danish player was first introduced in a match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros gained a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end they barely managed to keep a hair's worth of advantage for the 141-132-132 victory.
“We should always remind ourselves that even though we gained a big advantage in Valderrama, we won by a hair, and we also had a big advantage in Brookline, where we finally lost,” said Bjarn, who was seen in the picture after the 5-0 victory of the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday, which leads us to 10-5 at Le Golf National.
“We just have to think about the competitions of the previous years, and everyone can see that the game is not over yet.
You have to play with all your might tomorrow.
So go ahead and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that's all we have to focus on right now.
As I said before, I mostly deal with the 12 players on our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happens to be one of the biggest players in the world."
Proud of the team’s performance on the difficult track, Bj.rn added: “I would never make predictions in such a situation.
Tomorrow is a very different day.
Then it all depends on individual performance, which is completely different from team play.
It feels great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, you find out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what we need to make sure the players get the best out of themselves on the field tomorrow.
They need to get away from their partner, who will also have to do his best."
Unlike Bj arn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent's team, is particularly confident that his players perform better in singles than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the losing side after the brilliant performance of the European team called the "Medinah miracle".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied when he was asked how he encouraged the players before the last day, team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but the best start is as fast as we saw in Brookline.
If one team really gets into it, it puts enormous pressure on the opponent's players during the middle matches.
“We’ve put the order together and prepared our players to do a real miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of leading the efforts to turn the job around and playing against Rory McIlroy in the first match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
“I chose this order because I think this is how the picture comes together from the beginning to the end,” added Bjarn to the individual set-up.
Germany's Newest Warship Delayed
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war warships, but due to various system errors and exponentially increasing costs, this is at least until next year.
The inauguration of the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frigates "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the weekly Die Zeit, quoting one of the military spokespersons.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the continuous delays made the fate of the large-scale project very difficult.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class ageing frigates.
It is believed to have a high-fire cannon and various anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and cloaking technologies, including a signal damper that reduces the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it requires less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from the home ports.
However, due to the continuous slippage of the project, these high-tech warships, with which Germany could feel its power overseas, may become obsolete when they are finally put into service, Die Zeit noted.
The heavy-duty F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the vehicle and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There is not much information on the reasons for the return, but the German media refer to a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that make the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies are a very significant problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on Baden-Württemberg class warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes “Rheinland-Pfalz” is said to be twice as heavy as similar class ships put in command by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is an increasing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3.6 billion), while the initial draft calculated EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in the light of the warnings that Germany's presence at sea is being reduced.
Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently admitted that the Navy is "starting to run out of available warships".
According to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-exciting process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be decommissioned, but there are no more ships to replace the losses.
He expressed concern that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates have yet been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted on a Scottish-Highland estate to find out how bats exploit the characteristics of the landscape during hunting.
Researchers hope the results will provide new information on the behaviour of unique flying mammals, which could benefit future species conservation initiatives.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will investigate the behavior of common and soprano dwarf bats, as well as brown long-eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Garden area in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at appropriate points in the area to record bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will use hand-held detectors to collect mobile data.
Detailed analysis of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species are doing.
Researchers also prepare a habitat map and report to determine in detail how the behaviour of animals depends on the landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS conservation advisor, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
The size of bat populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the last century.
Construction and land development work disrupt the animals’ sleeping areas and reduce their living space.
Wind turbines and street lighting are also a risk factor for them, as are flypapers posted, certain chemical processes used for building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually completely blind.
However, because of their nocturnal predatory nature, they rely more on their hearing when hunting prey than on their sight.
With their sophisticated technique based on ultrasound reflection, they can determine the exact position of insects and landmarks in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They work with ten trained professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep site tests and are sometimes involved in rescue work.
The organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat trees.
According to estate manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“There’s a great place for bats here in Threeve,” he said.
“There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else you need for a good living space.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats, and thanks to the work we’ve done here and in other areas, we can learn more about what it takes to make them feel great.”
He also highlighted the importance of making sure that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as the destruction of a single colony could result in the destruction of 400 females and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment and disturbance of their habitat are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There is still much we do not know about bats, and we have almost no information about the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "false news". In his opinion, others want to use his name to "get into the public consciousness".
The football player's lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel.
A member of the Portuguese squad and the Juventus striker were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the accusations came to light, the 33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142 million fans in an Instagram Live video that the news was a lie.
“No, no, no, no and no.
The things they said about me today are all lies," the five-time gold ball player told the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to be famous with my name, that's the life of public figures.
I am a happy person and my life is in order,” the player added with a smile.
Because of the allegations, which were called "unacceptable, privacy-injurious suspicions", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, writes Reuters.
According to a statement by lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will file a claim for compensation “for moral damage caused to the extent of the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms hotel and casino in Las Vegas.
After they met at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went up to the athlete's suite, where the man anally raped a woman, according to documents filed with the district attorney's office in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent a good boy", except for "one percent".
According to the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted to having sexual relations with the woman, but he said it was with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims to have gone to the police, and in a hospital she had a sighting of her injuries, but later she agreed to an out-of-court agreement because she was “afraid of retribution” and “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to abrogate the agreement, as the trauma caused by the incident in question continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred at the time of the alleged attack (from Real Madrid to Manchester United), and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret’ losing car factories forever
The UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its position as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Business.
He added that Toyota UK is “worried” about its statement to the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, the car factory will be forced to temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, jobs could be lost due to delays at the borders.
Last year, the plant in Burnaston produced 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK drops out of the EU at the end of March, there will be production cuts at the factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concerns about the possibility of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its Minik manufacturing plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks of a no-deal Brexit in the supply chain.
Toyota's production line operates on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border disruptions could, according to industry representatives, lead to production delays and a shortage of parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store more than a day's supply of parts at its plant in Derbyshire, so production should be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU, known as Chequers, “is precisely designed to avoid delays at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best possible deal, which not only benefits from our current successes, but also offers new opportunities,” he said on BBC Radio 4 Today.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we need to maintain a highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would last, but warned that the cumulative costs could impair the competitiveness of the factory in the long term, which could eventually result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is currently representing the Unite trade union, trade union members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, we will never get back the jobs that have ceased at this time.”
A government spokesperson said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations."
Trump and Rosenstein’s meeting could be postponed again, White House says
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting could be postponed for another week, as the debate over the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said in a statement on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence on the elections, possible relations between Trump's advisers and the Russian government, and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months, Washington has speculated that Trump will eventually dismiss the deputy attorney general, putting Mueller's independence at risk.
According to this month's New York Times report, Rosenstein was considering arriving at the meeting wired to record a conversation with the President, and the question was raised as to whether the 25th constitutional amendment would allow Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what had been said.
However, he visited the White House last Monday and was rumored to be filing his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in New York before the United Nations, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would not like to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed so that it would not conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the final Senate vote even further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a date yet, we can set it for this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I see a chance for another week to be postponed.
We'll find out soon enough, and as usual, I'll notify the press."
However, some journalists have been skeptical about this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10th.
Chris Wallace asked me about that.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences was not due to his opposition to the "sensationist" behavior of television reporters, but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are really sensationalists."
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and representatives of the press would take place more often.
“The president gives more questions and answers than any previous president,” he said. He even added, without supporting the claim: “We looked at the numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s light years better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, and there have been many such occasions in the last few weeks, so instead of White House press conferences, they can talk to the President of the United States in person."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences held alone are rare.
Why, perhaps, can be inferred from what happened this week when the president in New York performed an unusual and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health ministry sent a letter to NHS Scotland employees in the European Union due to concerns about Brexit
In a letter, the head of the health ministry expressed the country’s gratitude to the employees of the NHS in Scotland from the countries of the European Union and stressed that he hoped they would remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the expected withdrawal of the United Kingdom.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of the established status applications of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to result in a decision in the autumn.
The UK Government has also started to prepare a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of how disturbing this must be for you.
That is why I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, no matter what country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to the healthcare portfolio, which has a positive impact on patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we would very much like you to stay with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after he suffered a head injury in a 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
“He walked to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The training team and medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side of the track, then put him on a stretcher and took him for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official in Nashville, Tennessee, told WSMV reporter Chris Harris that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “for the time being, he does not know any further details about the type and extent of the injury” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a year-old sophomore student, spends his first season on the Tennessee State team, where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he presented a total of five successful outfits before leaving the field, so he's already at 18 in the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for real estate purchased in the UK
According to Toryk’s new plan, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for real estate purchased in the UK, and the additional income from it will support homeless people.
This action would neutralize Corbyn’s success among young voters
The increase is aimed at those who are not taxed in the UK.
According to the Treasury, this would mean an annual income of 120 million pounds, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for real estate purchased in the UK, and the additional income from it will be used to support homeless people, Theresa May is about to announce at a press conference today.
The move is likely to counteract Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase will affect individuals and companies who are not taxed in the UK, and the additional income will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional fee added to the current levy, which is calculated in addition to the higher levy on second homes and properties purchased for expenditure two years ago, can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury expects an annual revenue of GBP 120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London properties are purchased by citizens outside the UK, causing a significant price increase, which makes the situation of first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the country’s wealthy districts have become “spirit cities”, especially in the capital city, as many foreign customers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in fees to help young people prepare to wait for their first home.
He personally holds large construction companies responsible for keeping real estate prices high, who have become a habit of buying up land and leaving it on the ground. He asked May to abolish the quotas on affordable houses and to do something about the "home market shame situation" in the country.
Corbyn announced remarkable proposals for a series of housing reforms, including rent control and the elimination of unwarranted evictions.
It would also give the councils more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to devote my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and making life better for each generation.
The property market situation needs to be resolved.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live, work and start a family here.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country, as well as foreign companies, to buy real estate as easily as hard-working citizens in England.
Dreams woven from home have become almost unattainable for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: "My main desire is to be the manager of the Scottish team"
According to Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, his "highest desire" is to be the manager of the Scottish national team one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, with only three points behind the first place.
He moved his seat to the Stadium of Light after successfully returning the St. Mirren team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the reserve, said Ross on the Scottish BBC Sportsound.
When I was a kid, I used to watch the Scottish team play a lot in Hampden with my father, and something always drew me back to them.
Now, however, I have a chance to succeed as a club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors at Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic is not nervous about following in the footsteps of such big names, and he has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I’m measuring success at the moment by whether I can get the team back to first class.
“If you look at the structure and facilities of the club, it definitely belongs in the first-class league,” he said.
“It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only consider my activities here a success if I manage to get the club back.”
Ross' management career began only three years ago, after he worked as an assistant coach for Dumbarton for a while and spent 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Aolla get back on her feet after the team fell back into the third class and won the championship with St. Mirren on the verge of losing next season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than he ever has in his career, whether it's Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren or Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real defining moment,” he recalled as the coach of Alloa.
“I definitely thought that being a manager was more for me than being a player.
That sounds strange, because I've done well, I've done quite well in my life, and I've even had some really memorable moments.
However, the lives of the players are sometimes very tough.
There's a lot to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but the management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've had a taste, I feel the best in my skin all my adult life."
The full interview will be broadcast on Sportssound's Sunday 30 September from 12:00 to 13:00 local time on Radio Scotland.
According to a study, beer rains best on Saturday afternoon at 5:30 p.m.
In the summer heat wave, the traffic of difficult pubs in England has increased significantly, but restaurant chains are still under pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenue of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but that of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, an employee of CGA, a business consulting firm that compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny period and England’s longer-than-expected World Championships, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in revenue, except that there was an even greater decline in restaurants.
The 1.8% revenue decline in restaurants in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars that mainly sold alcohol performed best, who even increased more than the loss of restaurants.
Pubs offering more food were also unpleasantly affected by the long - term sun, although not nearly as dramatic as restaurant operators.
People seem to be more in a mood to drink at this time of year.
The company-run pubs and bars saw a 6.6% increase in beverage revenue this month and a 3% drop in food revenue.”
Paul Newman, a RSM analyst in the leisure and hospitality industry, says: “These results follow the trend since the end of April.
Weather, as well as major community and sporting events, continue to be the main revenue factor for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and the annual revenue decline of 4.8% can be particularly painful due to continuous cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for restaurant operators, and it will only be revealed over time whether the more moderate weather experienced in August will bring relief in this area as well."
The total revenue growth of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slowing pace of the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales of the UK hospitality sector (pubs, bars and restaurants) and is widely accepted as an industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from an operator group of 47 members with a total turnover of more than 9 billion.

One in five children (even at the age of 11) creates a social media account that they hide from adults.
According to a survey of 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta fake accounts" is increasing rapidly, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
As a result of the news, the fear of sharing sexual content is increasing.
20% of students replied that they have an immaculate “main” account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage profile that said, "rape me."
According to research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), 40% of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles and 50% admit to having private accounts.
“I’m concerned that so many teens feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t reach them,” said HMC chief Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes in the Scottish Athletics Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Association at the annual board meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and the board president, Ian Beattie, believes that the sport’s decision-makers will be invaluable to the athlete’s extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athletic community, and his presence will help Scottish athletics develop,” Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: “I’m happy to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really help Scottish sports leaders.”
Two of the four Olympic gold medals of the American athlete who regularly spoke at the BBC were won at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but he was forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time, I'd decide if I'd ever recover.
It's a hard job, but I've managed to fully recover, I can walk again, I'm going to agility training today!
Thank you for many encouraging messages.”
Breast Sucker Advertising Like Cows Shares the Online Community
There was a heated online debate about the advertising of a breast-sucking company that compared nursing mothers to milk cows.
According to Elvie, she developed “the world’s first quiet, wearable breast pump” and advertised the appearance of their product in an ironic commercial evoking music videos, which showed the freedom of mothers milking their milk.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn full of straw, while in the background the lyrics of the following lines can be heard: “Yes, I milk myself, yet I have no tail” and “If I hadn’t noticed, these are not udders, but my breasts.”
And the chorus goes, "I'm pumping it, I'm pumping it, I'm pumping it, I'm pumping it, I'm milking the girls."
The ad posted on the company's Facebook page was quickly caught in the crossfire of online debates.
The video reached 77,000 views and received hundreds of mixed reception comments. Many say that advertising mocks the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s very distasteful to advertise the product with cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only when they give birth to offspring, but their calves are taken away from them within days," one speaker recalls.
Elvie breast pump can be discreetly placed in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment said: “Yes, it is terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell breast pumps to mothers who can keep their children?”
Someone else added: “Totally insensitive advertising.”
Others came to the defense of advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "horrible funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not trying to see into it anymore.
The product is brilliant,” he wrote.
Another commenter said: “It’s a funny ad at work or in a toilet for milking mothers who feel like ‘cows’ because of it.
It does not glorify or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they had the discreet breast pump in their bras the whole time they were dancing.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast pumps sometimes feel like cows.
Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is quiet, does not apply wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, so women can move freely, control their children, or even move out during breast suction.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s co-owner and communications director, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised in a bold, provocative way.
By pointing out the parallel between milking women and milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges of using breast pumps and to show in a funny way how our breast pump gives us a sense of freedom compared to this."
Elvie's breast pump wasn't on the news for the first time.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two entered the runway in Marta Jakubowski's dress while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of child migrants detained has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This can be partly explained by the fact that the harsh rhetoric of the Trump administration and its actions so far make it harder to find host homes for them.
Hosts are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and they fear that it would worsen their chances of staying in the country if they applied to receive children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that parents and adults in the same household would have to give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in a statement to Congress last week that dozens of people had been arrested who had applied to receive unaccompanied minors.
The office later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Eighty percent of the applicants and those in the same household are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals,” Albence said.
In order to speed up proceedings involving children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them must appear in court within one month of being detained instead of 60 days, social workers say.
Many people log in to court via video conferencing instead of appearing in person to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge does not grant legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed children become and the chances of violent outbursts or escape attempts increase.
According to rights defenders, these risks are only increased by a larger facility such as Tornillo, where the number of children makes it more difficult to filter out those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they do not give children enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends before they are transferred to such a facility, they will be even more traumatized.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" to leave immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking before the UN General Assembly, has asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland despite the civil war that has been raging in the country for the eighth year.
Moualem, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces had illegally entered Syrian territory on the grounds of the fight against terrorism, and “that is how they will be treated.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He stated that Damascus “continues its holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” from terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence.”
There are 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, most of them training and advising Kurdish forces and Arab militias fighting Bashar al-Assad.
France has sent more than 1,000 soldiers to the war-torn country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem claimed that conditions were appropriate for their return and that only "some Western countries" aroused "irrational fears", discouraging refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help people return home,” he said.
“They made a policy out of a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone around the last great citadel of insurgents, Idlib, could facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a wide-ranging attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
At the same time, Moualem stressed that the agreement defines "clear deadlines" and indicated his hope that military actions will only be directed against jihadists, including the An-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which must be "exterminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene a committee of government and opposition delegates soon to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare the elections.
Moualem, among other conditions, considers the participation of the Syrian government in the committee to be acceptable, for example, only "reviewing certain articles of the current constitution" and warns all external actors against interfering in the process.
That is why Trump will be re-elected.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true, and a prosecution or a scandal will put an end to his presidency prematurely.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential finale of all time."
For now, however, viewers enjoy the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its ratings to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen data, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" running on MSNBC is the most watched cable show with its 3.5 million audiences, which it achieves on the nights of major news.
“It attracts us like fire because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s drama series “The Designated Survivor.” In this series, a low-ranking cabinet minister sits in the presidency after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell is a veteran comedy writer, author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
This is how he recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why,” Scovell asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” the driver replied.
It's the entertainment of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade's precedent, whether the stability of immigrant families and the world economy can be reunited.
Only a very narrow layer can make you ignore these facts.
However, it is no longer part of responsible information when we have been watching a debate programme for the sixth hour about the authenticity of the anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book "Fear", or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin jacket (the dress of body arrogance as formulated by The Washington Post) or the consequences of Stormy Daniels Trump, um, the description of Stormy Daniels Trump.
As far as I'm concerned, that's what I'll always remember about Super Mario from now on.
“You feel a bit like you’re watching a reality show where you get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of “The Stars.” Trump’s show is constantly changing, and new turns are coming every day (he goes to N.F.L., praises Kim Jongun).
If you miss a single part, you'll miss it immediately.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was a nice, 26-degree, sunny day for Kauain, but he was still in his house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing those crazy shows, a lot of people said it was the beginning of the end for Western civilization,” Fleiss said.
“I thought they were joking, but they were right.”

Both parties pour money into the tightest races of the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in Pennsylvania's 17th constituency spent the money uncounted after two active representatives fought for the same seat after redrawing the congressional districts.
One of the competitors for the recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburban district is the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former 12th constituency, which has a significant overlap with today's 17th district.
The map had to be redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found in January that the former district borders had been manipulated to the advantage of Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, the two parties' funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC), were almost bidding on each other during the campaign.
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning the popular interim election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional constituency in March.
The seat of representatives for more than a decade belonged to the Republicans, Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China and then withdrew from the plan
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, to which Washington has hardly responded.
Donald Trump was in a good mood in June 2017 with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed the Trump Organization leadership team out of there.
The State Department recalled senior staff from U.S. offices in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama “due to their recent decision not to support Taiwan”, said Heather Nauer, spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including combating drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed punitive measures, such as cuts in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As the private meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, and its primary goal was to reduce migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
It was announced that Vice-President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, which, according to diplomats, is a clear signal of how important the administration considers the event to be.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnation statements or take punitive measures.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the dispute, which were reported anonymously by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump has obstructed justice in any way... and a number of facts have been made public.
Mueller's investigation is also said to include whether Trump's team has cooperated with Russia trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are in the majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are many uncertain questions, and Trump’s downfall is far from inevitable... nor is it for his European friends.
Serious decisions have to be made on both sides of the Atlantic – it depends on how long the fight will last.
In 1938, many German officers were ready to punch Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
The support was not provided, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the coming years.
At such historical turning points, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy will accelerate or slow down.
In today's America, we can identify several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump replaces Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's chair has been swaying since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested that conversations with the president be recorded and suggested that Trump was unfit to fill his office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times reported the events inaccurately.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is biased or incomplete and is appointed to the Supreme Court despite a credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question: in the interim election, are we voting for a Congress that is ready to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face a long winter.
I hope it doesn't, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once resided in my ambassadorial home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on the table bearing the sign of swastika during the Sabbath.
With such a cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Rangers’ Graham Dorrans confident ahead of match against Rapid Wien
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against the Spanish Villarreal will give them the opportunity to participate in the European League Group G.
Due to the knee injury of the midfielder Graham Dorrans, he was unable to enter the field in the season until the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he feels that based on this result, the Rangers can set themselves bolder goals.
“It was an important point against a great team, Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old.
“We believed we could score and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big game.
I hope we get the three points, but it won’t be easy because they were good enough in the last game, but with our fans behind us we will definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was quite difficult, I was injured, there were a lot of changes around the club, but now the mood is very optimistic.
We have a good team, the guys are enjoying the game, the training is going well.
I hope that if we give our all, we can put the last season behind us and achieve good results."
Many women worry about not saving enough for their old age.
The survey participants had an accurate idea of what care they wanted in old age, but only a small number of them talked to their family members about it.
According to a survey by Nationwide, only half of the respondents discussed with their spouse the expected costs of their care in old age.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"Everyone wants a family member to take care of them, but they don't usually raise the issue," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
The following is worth doing.
Discuss with your spouse and children first: You can’t expect them to take proper care of you if you don’t tell them in time what your needs are.
Together with your advisor and family, choose where and what care you want; these decisions have a significant impact on subsequent costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can give you useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Funding can be made with a traditional insurance policy designed for old age care, or with a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have enough resources to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: Thus, the possibility of subsequent litigation is cut off in advance.
Entrust a representative, a trusted person, to act on your behalf in health matters, supervise your medical care and ensure that everything is done to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
Trust someone to manage your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and takes care of paying bills when you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer any questions about your medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
“It’s not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn’t matter who the doctor is,” Martin said.
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a massive earthquake hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of victims may continue to increase.
The area's communication network has also been damaged, so there has been no news from Donggala Governorate north of Palu, where it was the center of the 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province, built on the west coast of the island of Celebes, at the end of a narrow bay, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was struck by earthquakes and tsunamis.
The governorate of Donggala is more than 300 km long on the northwest coast of the island of Celebes.
The population of the governorate, an administrative region smaller than the province, was about 299 200 in 2017.
Central Celebs is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by a tsunami, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes are common.
Here are just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a huge sea quake began on the west coast of the Aceh province of North Sumatra, which launched a tsunami reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of the victims killed in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
On the island of Nias, near Sumatra, hundreds died.
2006: A 6.8 quake shook the southern part of Java, Indonesia's largest island, and the tsunami following it claimed almost 700 victims on the south coast.
2009: 7.6 earthquake destroyed near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 quake shook an island in the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra and sometimes caused a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake has hit Aceh Pidie Jaya's governorship. The panic and destruction that followed has brought back memories of the terrible tsunami in 2004.
There was no escape this time, but more than 100 inhabitants died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed, and thousands of tourists were stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of having committed domestic violence, obstructed reporting of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, Alaska State Police said.
According to the police report, when a lady friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at Mat-Su Prison and has been bailed out for $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and replied to the question about his guilt that he was “not guilty at all”.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be fined up to four years in prison and $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which may result in a one-day detention and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been in trouble with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being heard by the Alaskan Veterans Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of reporting the crime, as well as possession of weapons under alcoholic influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time said he hit him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by several veterans' organizations in 2016 when she attributed her son's behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people were killed in a Friday earthquake on the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power and telecommunications have become inoperable, and the number of dead is likely to increase in the coming days.
The center of the earthquake was near Central Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
A number of videos on social media have been published about the arrival of the tsunami.
Hundreds of people gathered at a celebration on the beach of Palu, when the tsunami landed.
Federal prosecutors call for death penalty for New York terror attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that claimed eight lives.
Saipov, 30, is accused of driving a rental truck from Home Depot on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway in October, running over a number of pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to prove the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight of his victims and "intentioned" to cause injury, according to the submission of the Prosecutor's Office of the Southern District of New York.
According to the document submitted, the evidence of any of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion, which had been used almost exclusively against organised crime, as well as the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and premeditated intent”, say the prosecutors, and Saipov, as they put it, carried out his actions in a “horrible, cruel, inhumane” way.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern district last asked for the death penalty for a defendant a decade ago.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a death sentence was executed in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple were convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbekistani-born Saipov did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was pleased with what he had done.
Saipov said that the ISIS videos he watched on his phone gave him the idea of the attack, the indictment says.
According to the police, he asked for an ISIS flag to be posted in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "understandably disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutors.
“In our opinion, the actual life sentence for confession would have been more favourable, the death penalty only prolongs the suffering of all the actors involved in the case,” Patton claims.
Saipov's defenders have previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty for their defense.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage said at the demonstration during the Tory conference that he was “calling the people’s army into battle”.
Former Ukip leader says politicians should feel pressured by Eurosceptics after Theresa May's party partner suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone, who did not fill any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have quit long ago if Farage were the Brexit Minister.
The pressure on May is well described by the fact that the pro-remaining Tory spoke at another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires constant competition between Brexit and the pro-remainers and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party can only choose between his package or "total chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that the "Chequers deal" should be dealt with.
He suggested that Farage should be admitted to the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had led the negotiations, we would have left already,” he said.
The Wellingborough representative added: “I will stick to Brexit, but the Chequers deal must be dealt with.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servants of others.
We want to make our own country’s laws.”
Bone rejected the assumption that since the 2016 vote, the public mood has changed: “There is no reality that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay.”
Tory MEP Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and told journalists: “All I ask is this: Prime Minister, listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among party members, and especially among activists who work in the field and helped us get to government.
Forget about the Chequers deal and listen to us."
As a cornered message to May, he added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat.”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “feel the pressure” not to betray the result of the 2016 referendum.
“Trust between us – between the people and our politicians – is now at stake,” he said.
“They want to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do it.”
He told the crowd: “I want our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are calling on the people’s army to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the UK an independent, independent, proud country again.”
Meanwhile, the pro-remainers marched in Birmingham and held a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists waved the flag of the "Toryk against Brexit" movement formed this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives in the party's application because of the security flaws at the opening of the conference.
“These people have said they have the IT background for a Canada-plus-plus deal, an unhindered border crossing and a border-free free trade agreement with Ireland,” he added.
- They're just talking.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren 'considers carefully' running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would consider running for president.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at a public forum in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing for a re-election in November against the Republican representative of the state, Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There have been speculations for some time that he might be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th public forum meeting with voters since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Warren said in his reply that it was time for “women to play a role in the recovery of the misguided government in Washington, including the takeover of the supreme position”.
Man arrested for shooting Sims in LSU
Police at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Friday they had arrested a man suspected of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. East Coast time.
Earlier this week, a video of the shooting was released, asking for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a head injury that turned out to be fatal,” police captain Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being at the scene, had a gun, and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, the man was arrested at East Baton Rouge District Police Station.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, nearly 2 meters high Sims played 32 games last season, played 10 as a beginner, played an average of 17.4 minutes per match, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton gets closer to the World Championship title after winning in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it immediately became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions will play a major role in the race.
The Bottas from the pole position started well and almost got Hamilton into trouble because he defended his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, Vettel stood in the boxing street and let Hamilton get stuck in the traffic behind the middle field, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes stood up a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton passed after a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner curve free after moving twice as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row of the dice, and by the end of the first round, he was the seventh.
He then drove most of the race because he did not change tires so that he could quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikkenen in the hope of fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round, he stood in the boxing street, but in the remaining eight laps he could not increase his pace, so Raikkene became the fourth place.
"It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job to get the first two places," Hamilton said.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday because the senator insisted that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment as a new member of the Supreme Court.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but merely noted that the things in the Senate prove that people are "detestable, detestable and lying".
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, is when they see anger, when they see people angry, despicable, detestable and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the statements and the leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember his answer... Did you leak the document? – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, hold on a second.
No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked at the beginning of September. Feinstein, however, denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, and I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential according to his request."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who noted at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I will tell you what the situation is: his body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't leak it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, claiming that the Democrats were using the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They can see the vileness, the abomination, they don’t care who they hurt, they don’t care who they have to run over to gain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the match against Dundee
With his 5:3 victory at the Dundee rematch on Saturday, Dundee Stars atone for their defeat from Belfast Giants at the Elite League game on Friday.
Through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants had an early two-way lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the Hungarians, and then Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard equalized Dundee's disadvantage, then Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured their victory.
This was Adam Keefe's third Elite League loss this season, who beat Dundee 2:1 Friday night in Belfast.
The two parties met for the fourth time in the season, in the previous three matches the Giants won the victory.
Dwyer's opening goal in the fourth minute, fell from Kendall McFaull's goal pass at 3:35, and four minutes later, with David Rutherford's help, Beauvillier doubled their advantage.

Dwyer made sure the Giants could lead him to the break when he scored his second goal at the end of the first third.
The home team reorganized its ranks, and Bouchard equalized again with a man-advantaged goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran's combination helped Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the game towards the end of the second third, and then took care of the victory with his team's fifth goal in the last third.
The Giants, who lost four of their last five games, returned to Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Control killed to save hundreds of people on the plane from the earthquake
They celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia as a hero, who died while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people can take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after the island of Celebes was shaken by a major earthquake on Friday, resulting in a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many are trapped under debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there so that Batik Air's flight 6321 on the runway could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought he was crashing.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could save hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, however, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were heartbroken when we heard the news,” he said.
Authorities fear that the death toll could be thousands, and according to the country's disaster response organization, the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong are difficult to reach.
“The number of victims is likely to continue to increase as many are trapped under the rubble and many have not been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization.
The waves reaching a height of six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft transport assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles bring new bodies every minute.
There's little clean water.
The shops were looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors in a race against time, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a real tragedy, but it can be much worse.
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN coverage.
Indonesia has been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, killing more than 500 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says a person has disappeared in a plane crash in the lagoon
According to a recent statement from an airline operating a plane that crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, one person was missing, although it was previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, he can't account for a male passenger according to the situation on Sunday afternoon.
According to the airline, he's working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to further information about the passenger, such as questions about his age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after the plane crashed into water during landing at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the events have not yet been clarified.
According to the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon outside the runway.
According to some witnesses, the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane flew very low.
“That’s a really good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to run into the emergency exits of the sinking plane in water up to the waist.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors repairing a quay nearby helped rescue people and delivered them to shore in an inflatable boat before the plane sank 30 meters below the water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines with PNG registration in the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst puts together the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor told the prosecutor on Saturday at the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an information analysis expert.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several phones that indicated he was with Tellis Chambers the night she died, which contradicts the man's previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "a liar because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that at the time of her death, she knew Chambers about two weeks ago.
According to cell phone records, they've only known each other a week.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls and contact details from her phone.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought before the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hiphoptrio called for a negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
According to The High Breed in Bristol, hiphop has drifted away from its roots in political messages and social problems.
They want to return to these roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common are once again popular in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Is it black again?
New York nanny sues party for dismissal after ‘racist’ message
A New York nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for discriminatory dismissal after a mistranslated message from the mother complaining that they had managed to hire a "black" nanny again.
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to "blackmail."
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed disappointment when she saw the woman black on her first day of work when the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, arrived in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Instead of her husband, however, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his blunder, the "unpleasant" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the outgoing nanny, who was African-American, did a bad job and was expecting a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal and asking for $350 a day for the six-month residential work for which he was originally hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them how to stop, you can't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that the termination of Maurice's application was reasonable because they feared that they could not trust him after he was offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
We're not racist," the husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to someone with whom, even if by chance, you were rude?
Your newborn?
Oh, come on."
According to Plasco, who resembled "blackmail", his wife gave birth to the baby only two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation".
“Would you attack someone like that?
It's not very nice to do that," the investment banker added.
While the legal process is taking place, the public court has already quickly condemned the party on social media, condemning their behavior and logic.
Paddington publisher fears readers won’t be able to connect to a talking bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to imagine ourselves in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it is published.
It's pretty fun to have this information now that we know what a huge success Paddington is."
According to him, his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before feeling inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, would not have resented his work if he had been rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was bittersweet after his father's death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of their family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man, he was not conceited at all,” he said.
But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child carrying something: we're proud of him, even if it's not really our credit.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he created it and came out of his imagination, he always attributed success to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When he landed, he and his daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“Nad called me regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that they didn’t expect him to survive,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I said good-bye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his system.
He died before, and that's when everything stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait knowing it was all over.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the others who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I kept my head down and my tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I had this overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needs my love and my understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
Postcard with bereaved women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a Welsh bridge.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way I feel every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook, and his smile stuck to everyone.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would make any place better."
However, before his death, he gave up his work because he was “in very bad condition.”
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old ex-brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would cause some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David created the postcards “to let people know that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Ms. Davies' girlfriend for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“He didn’t say he was depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely down on Christmas Day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and stuff."
He said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “He left a huge gap in the family.
He broke our hearts into little pieces.
But we must continue to fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we could achieve what he asked for – a limited-time, limited-scale investigation – we might be able to come to an agreement,” Flake said, adding that the committee was afraid of being “broken to pieces” because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI's investigation?
Their resistance can only be attributed to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their man into the highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House, and through him he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get the minimum of 50 votes in the Senate that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to make the decision to include Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors 'reduced' under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean dissidents heading for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Bjengszok quoted data from the Southern Unification Ministry and said that in the last year there were 1127 dissidents compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said tighter border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not commented on this information publicly.
The majority of the Northern dissidents will eventually receive South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China welcomes dissidents as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still virtually at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, focusing on the stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came in June with a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they broadly agreed on further cooperation on the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in Americans, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances it is inconceivable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh ‘hysterical’, says he’s unfit for Supreme Court
The minority president of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court "hysterical" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said so in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“It occurred to me that if a woman ever acted this way, she would be called ‘hysteric,’” Pelosi said in a statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh protested with emotion against rumors that he would have sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when he was a teenager.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming, and his voice faded when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also strongly condemned the committee's democrats, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character murder", angry liberals organized because of Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's locked himself out with his statements and his behavior against the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable if he filled the post and if the Democrats got the majority in the House.
"I'm saying that if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, you don't belong not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court you're in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Capital Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions under the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, as Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about whether he would alter the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to become a member of the court and expect us to burst with joy,” Pelosi said.
And women have to be in control.
It's a legitimate outburst, and for months and years, there's a build-up of anger that can't be released without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s that rare, right?”
“I was greatly helped by a woman who worked somewhere in a management position,” he continued. “She told me that she was crying in anger, but she developed a technique according to which, when she started crying in anger, she said to her interlocutor: ‘You may think that I am sad because I am crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea.”
Part of the reason tears are condoned as a sign of anger is because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an early job, a male-dominated office, where I once cried in my angry helplessness that I was grabbed by an older woman at my neck – a cool manager I was always afraid of – and taken to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an out-of-wedlock affair with Monkey Business and fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in her deep frustration, found out that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought-out decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and they wanted another candidate in the middle of their backs.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder missed the fundraising, so she vowed not to compete unless she collected the $2 million.
It was a battle to lose in the first place.
He realized that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“Did you think I was getting a discount?” he wondered.
When he held a press conference that he did not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by gratitude for the people who supported him, as well as by frustration and anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money and directly reach voters, that his throat was stuck.
“They thought I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“They thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
“Crying”?’
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening line of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and although the battle was not nearly over, the break between countries could, according to experts, benefit Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warnings earlier this year by imposing a tax on major Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new tariffs already affect $200 billion worth of products, practically taxing half of the goods going from China to the US.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated, most recently imposing a tariff of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to strike back every time, and the world's second largest economy will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you want to get Washington to back down, that would mean you have to cave in to the demands, but a public bow to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, President of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing is good at tactics, the U.S. trade war pressure could be good for China in the long run, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in either Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could plunge any of the two countries’ economies into an economic vortex is far more serious than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, Asia research assistant at the New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed in war for more than seven years.
In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Moallem claimed that the state of the country was improving.
“The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the results achieved in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restructure the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and arbitrary economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said the Syrian state would welcome any assistance to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional help or assistance from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team in 16,5:10,5 at Le Gold National, held outside Paris.
The U.S. has failed on the European stage for the sixth time in a row and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its title because the Danish team captain Thomas Bj arn reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, an American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, threw his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer was shining in all circles of Molinari, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved a 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 from the lowest-ranking player in the European team, the Danish Thorbj arn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 against the English Ian Poulter, who may have taken part in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cup veterans, Sergio Garcia of Spain, became the best European winner of the tournament of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that I got the cup back.
It’s all about the team and I’m happy to be able to help,” he said after Garcia’s emotional victory in Europe.
The baton will be handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, a man I grew up watching,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 career record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, and who is only preceded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaut, who played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing result of the U.S. team captain Jim Furyk, he said: “He is proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we lit a fire in Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
Great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're redeploying our team, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to put your hats on, too.
The opponent was better than us."
