I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.

It's not over until it's over.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
She could be better with your sister.
It goes hand in hand with the love I have for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
Could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
It definitely freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
It didn't stop snowing.
The snow didn't stop.
I don't care if you come.
You're welcome.
It doesn’t matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I slowly realized that I had misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
This happened on the day of our marriage, darling.
There must have been a reason for this.
It was sudden.
It happened while he was out.
It's happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.

I think it's fair.
It is very unlikely, in my opinion, that you will be able to do it on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.

I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.

I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we've been talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I doubt if it will work.
It's getting very late.
He left.
It's half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It’s time to start a new business.
It is important to promote our language in every way possible.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
Marvellous!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
Smoke alarms cannot be turned off.
It's not the best solution.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's no secret.
I'm not the one Tom's got a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, the weather's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
Time for bed.
It's too easy for him.

It'll be ready when it needs to be.
It will take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
It'll wear off soon.

Consequently, it looks bigger.
Looks good.
I don't seem to be needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
We need to fix it.
He never existed.
It should never have happened.

I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It was raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I work out two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've traveled all over the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I try to keep informed.
I'm trying to gather my thoughts.
That's a nice flag.

It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock in the evening.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same song.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's an ugly business, Watson, it's an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
It's too bad Tom's leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
It's a rumor.
It's freezing.

Nothing seems to have changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
He seems to be lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
It seems to me you're honest.
You look like you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It's only fair that they get the same pay for the same job.
It's far from perfect.
It is far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
He's losing it.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a tough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's lucky to see a shooting star.
It's nice to be gay.

It's just a hunch.
It's just over there.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's hard.
That's pretty important.

That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
None of your business.
Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.

I wasn't talking to you.
I'm not talking to you.

It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring like a tub.
He spread his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to disparage the working class, acquitting imperialism of the responsibility of the bloody wars it provokes, and to sow the seed of the thought that the innate aggressive tendencies of man are the cause of endless wars.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, right?
That's a big deal.

It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
This is technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.

Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!

This was not long before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It was not a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a low blow.
It didn't matter.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't so bad.
It's not the first time they've done this.

We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
I'm having a hard time getting out of here.
It's pointless.
It would have been better if it had already been arranged.
That's not bravery, that's stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
I underestimated Tom.
Right.
I understand that it's uncomfortable for you, but don't worry.
I understand what you're saying, but I don't know what you're talking about.
I understand what you're saying, but I'm not impressed.
I understand your problem.
