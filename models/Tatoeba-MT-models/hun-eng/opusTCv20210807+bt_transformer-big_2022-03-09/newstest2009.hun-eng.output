The Prague Stock Exchange at the End of the Trade
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the rapid fall in the morning.
Transactions in the Czech Energy Company’s shares amounted to almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its decline from Tuesday’s start, when it fell by almost six percent.
This year, Wall Street shares are falling.
This is also how the market's reaction to the result of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Decline in Shares in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in stocks on Tuesday, although some of the losses were finally cancelled during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock market index described almost four percent during trading, but later it deleted some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which monitors Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell 3.8 percent, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock market fell 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world’s financial markets,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and adopt a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences.
The Bloodbath of American Shares
On Monday, the House of Representatives rejected a plan to support the financial system, which should have been spent $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroner).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call for support for the plan.
Bush said the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks were hit by a bloodbath and leading stock indices recorded the biggest decline in 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell almost seven percent, the last time it experienced a similar fall was in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The Supreme Leaders of the U.S. Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in negotiations to approve a rescue plan in the form of $700 billion in financial assistance to the U.S. financial system (about 12 trillion kroner).
But there's no victory yet.
Congress needs to complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and their vote.
The financial support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Institutions Committee, informed the Reuters news agency.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
Economists believe that there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, a "sobriety" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a big step.
We have resolved our divergent views on what the form of the market stabilisation package should be,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, on Saturday night to give final form to the government fund.
This should buy up unsellable mortgages from financial companies, which put financial companies in serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the whole system.
“We are close to reaching a final agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
The repair plan still needs to be continued, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, says lawmakers are therefore seeking to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before the start of trading in Asian financial markets, where the time zone could be the first to influence Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor will it be possible for the trial to be blocked at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be approved in the coming days.
However, the law still undergoes a number of changes.
The total amount intended to help the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President Bush’s request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress can block the issue of the remaining amount, which is set at an additional $100 billion and later $350 billion, if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function.
Bush assesses progress in negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to acquire material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, remained, as hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgage loans.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate should be able to vote on Monday,” Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Bush spokesman Tony Fratto said the president was “satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciates the bipartisan efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of gross severance payments
Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called severance payments of the directors participating in the programme and sets up a supervisory committee for the fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury Department.
“We have worked very hard on this and have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will benefit all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on the help of homeowners who are having trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new installments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly installments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Support
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
This is because it is not possible to know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic actives will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute losses among themselves," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is far more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give its blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual significance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Match at the edge: MP3 players vs. mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, you can't call with a single MP3 player.
I think it’s better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
He's probably having a hard time getting a high-quality expensive record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if your shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, you probably dream of such a record player.
This is similar to travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue 8,000 kroner for a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to find it difficult to accept a 20-kroner market earpiece.
There are two extremes between which there is room for everyone.
There's a lot of choice.
The lifespan of the elements also matters.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but also what most mobiles don't do by chance.
No device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and texting, you can play music and video, record both, have a better and worse camera, and even navigate.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures.
Multi-functional mobile has its drawbacks.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, you should expect that they will not play for more than a few hours.
Even if you call here and there, get another charger for your workplace just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have this problem, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without an adapter with miniature memory cards used in mobiles.
With some exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
It is enough to charge the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobile phones and players already create a music library in order based on the performer himself, the album name, the genre name or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only represent a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing a specific device, ask first of all about the battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and, of course, the comfort of handling.
If the music is primarily a background for you and you only listen to it for a short time a day, for example, on the tram, any mobile playing MP3 is suitable for you.
Any mobile phone can do that.
You don't even have to pay attention to what music formats the mobile or player can play.
All of them can handle MP3, and the vast majority of the music you get will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most common and the vast majority of devices can cope with WMA music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a powerful argument for the purchase of music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is lousy and usually limited to one summer radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that such a way of selling music (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their mobile devices with them all the time.
Whenever he feels like listening to something, he gropes his cell phone in his pocket while the forgotten MP3 player lies at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry the headphones or at least the speakerphones with you.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker, which is used by almost all mobile, but only a small number of MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music phones will probably be the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get quite a decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of a conventional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones can cost up to 15,000 kroner.
However, the advantage of the players is, among other things, simple operation.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) will be dealt with by everyone.
Minimal function, handling similar to a previously standard cassette recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of an accidentally switched-on mobile internet, nor in the form of a huge bill for data transmission.
What equipment to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening for removable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can fit a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
For more demanding listeners, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment is close to the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, which has the same user interface as MP3 players sold separately, has reached the farthest point in the sector.
MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to four thousand kroner, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will arrive in the Czech Republic later this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively developed and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual service provider that forces classic service providers to significantly reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be for long.
On the Mobil.cz website, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This has been confirmed by the European Commission, which has pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in the rest of the EU.
Following the European Commission's latest move, roaming charges may therefore be subject to a controversial situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, text messages from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, as we have three mobile networks and our penetration is well above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvorák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, often agrees with this, who has previously stated a few times that there is no place for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classic service provider with its own network probably does not have much of a chance (although it is probably difficult to find a frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about a significant price reduction, to which classical service providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were sounds like ours.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, we do not have to go too far for example.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is backed by the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need a lot less customers than a traditional service provider.
It does not result in relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear to be low-cost - they offer cheap calls and sms, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS messages at least 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move to bet on a target group.
This service is especially focused on men.
“Real men choose the Mobilking service provider – who they like, who they can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual service.
It is difficult to say whether a similar idea can work for us in Poland.
Vodafone’s spokesperson, Miroslav .epick., doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not seem to be very hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," said Jana Studnicová, a spokesman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it showed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best to avoid any potential competition.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not hidden its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which thus intends to take another step towards making Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in providing not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner the better.
This possibility has been discussed again with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe now's a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that we may be lucky with the first virtual service provider by the end of the year.
However, his birth is still surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that a fully-fledged virtual service provider has a place in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been addressed by a single subject that offers a complex and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr.e., from the press department of Telefónica 02, mentioned to Mobil.cz.
The other operators also refer to the special situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, in agreement with O2, adds: "So far, we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which it can be based."
And he added: “In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At the moment, we should have a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in the short term."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav ?epick? adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find partners to build networks shared for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - on the same string as service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of a new service provider would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a reduction in their profits.
So why should we make it easier to enter such a competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate with something important, they also testify to the huzavona around the birth of U:fon.
The biggest pressure on the T-Mobile company was probably around the birth of its U:phone.
This is evidenced by the publicly available information on the website.
But right now, U:fon is a good argument for why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: “The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the access of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be highly demanding."
However, in view of this attitude of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of Czech regulators is amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just about the attitude of the EU, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic, unlike Britain and other developed countries, has no right to interfere in economic competition.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a specific attitude to the whole problem.
“The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider to lease the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the supply of potential interested parties has probably not been sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," Kristián Chlapua, from the External Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority, mentioned in answer to our question.
A statement by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses their market position is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Foreignly, where virtual service providers generally operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the decline in the price of mobile phone services."
However, the interests of the ÚOHS probably do not include pressure to operate correctly in the market environment and to reduce prices.
In this case, it is truly shocking that the reaction of the three mobile operators is quite touching.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is almost self-evident.
Like gas stations, completely identical petrol prices are certainly just the work of chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not detected any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither provider has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for its market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing for the telecom regulator," Chalupa said.
The presentation of the market leadership is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by TÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the creation of a virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it is necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting in a strikingly similar way.
Meanwhile, complaints from a range of interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all service providers.
And putting responsibility on the road is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the ÚOHS takes its hands off the whole case.
We have seen this in similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the extension of the scope of ?Tú's powers in the field of economic competition could not be carried through in telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
Representatives of the NOJS should know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one is watching.
In the meantime, some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, many of which are already operating in Czech mobile networks, will remain undetected.
These are companies issuing their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
They are multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company customer against the service provider, ordering a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-emption.
"If there were cases that you were talking about, it could be a breach of terms and conditions that we would deal with and that could lead to the end of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that news of this type of activity has not reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three mentioned companies may be thousands of customers.
In the meantime, no service provider will defend itself against such a procedure.
They have a significant profit from the activities of these companies, and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not particularly threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav ?epick? warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot have it in full as a general customer of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what the U.S. should be strange about.
There is also another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they hindering the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to expose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this kind and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As has already been mentioned a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has resulted in a noticeable price reduction of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied a market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was precisely at this moment that regulators intervened, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are giving each other the whole case.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may start to move again.
If a service provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it is difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be making more expensive calls anymore.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four covers of the new version of the Czech State Anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the State Anthem Where is my country?
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Ji
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, choirs or instrumentals.
Katesina Knsínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the amendment of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kraek.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
Balohlavek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He told Czech Radio earlier that he deliberately chose young representative singers to sing solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of the clear diction, the clearness of the text and the harmony of both of them," he mentioned.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first performed at the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetán's play Tyl Fidlova.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
After the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem.
Even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
What is the “New” Anthem
Prague Transport Company Delivers Chip Card for the First Time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 enters itself into the history of Prague Transport Company as the first passenger to get into metros, trams and buses who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30-day, 90-day, and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save them on their chip cards in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at Muzeum, M?stek, Nádra?í Hole?ovice, And?l, Roztyly, Let?any, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Ka?erov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday, coupons can be purchased online through the Transport Company's www.dpp.cz website.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon.
Those who start using online trading can finally forget about the windows of metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand through long lines for tickets.
The coupon can be purchased online and saved on the Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help interested parties shop online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrna, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in self-service vending machines equipped in some lobbys.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket handlers, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Bud.jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but there should be 80 by the end of the year,” added Opatrna.
Automatic check of the coupon instead of the driver
Managing the vending machines that start their operation tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and save the previously paid coupon on your own.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the Central Bohemia districts travel primarily to the capital city.
"On trains classified as integrated transport in Prague, conductors were equipped with card readers to determine the zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization that compiled Prague public transport schedules.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the driver's checkout.
Thus, when boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in the place specified on the side of the cashier.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
“If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way is to ask the driver to do so,” Dráp added.
Passengers who do not travel by bus around the city and do not remember when their coupon expires can go to self-service vending machines that save coupons on cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the equipment display.
The Sudeten wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked to be attached to the United States of America.
This is revealed by the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It is said that this was the wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also revealed by a letter preserved from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Cesky Krumlov ask the U.S. President not to allow the return to the Czech Republic of the "County of .umava", which was occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are not coming to the German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it says in the letter, signed with the words "People who care about the fate of .umava."
Since the attachment to Czechoslovakia is supposed to give the Sudeten Germans, in addition to knowing the Czech national character, only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the protectorate over .umava "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million people, it would condemn this area to us as a foreign country, which would oppress and destroy the minority and contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors couldn't sign is supposedly the fear of revenge from the "Czech oppressors".
So if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in .umava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the county of .umava on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in addition to the current knowledge of postwar history, according to some historians, it properly depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have a minimal suspicion that they were being evacuated from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others hoped to simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in ?eské Bud?jovica.
During the war, Chalupa served as a German in the Baltic Sea.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and sent him to the prison camp in Holtinsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be deported from the country on the basis of the Benes decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaigns Attack Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history is the safety of roads.
This is how the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday could be described.
The office of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Ales . . . hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from engaging in dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but it will also appear on leaflets.
Drivers should be deterred from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
It is primarily intended to address the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what appears in the advertisements?
Emotionally offensive, primarily human stories.
The whole campaign's "bloody" slogan is proof of this:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "not thinking" on the license plate is in large letters.
And the blood pool contains the word "you'll pay."
This should symbolize that a man can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
The viewers are "scared" by advertising spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let the drivers go
"Drivers are subject to the 'pull it, let it go' system.
For them, 'let it go' is when they go through the red light, for example, saving time.
The "pull" is the risk of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk,” says Martin Kocán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why we need an information campaign in the press, primarily a negative campaign, the psychologist says.
According to him, the driver's attention to danger signs are less effective.
"If a danger warning sign is installed, it is likely to merge quickly with the environment and the drivers will not deal with it," Kocaan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke about the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. the west coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan plateau in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview published daily by Jediot Acronot on Monday.
“We have to make a deal with the Palestinians, which means we have to return almost all, if not all, of the land,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of Israeli territory, because without them there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and wants tractors and bulldozers not to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, has to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to two attacks in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" in the Old Town.
Anyone who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he stressed.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also gave an opinion on the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan plateau, which he believes is an essential condition for a peace treaty with Syria.
This would require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“I do not recommend making peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan,” he warned.
“The Syrians know what they have to give up in order to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shia movement); they must give up their regular support to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shia movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq,” the Prime Minister said.
Questions After an Accident: Are Flight Attendants Illegal in Buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, near Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could travel on the bus.
"If we were to strictly and formally comply with the law, the cabin attendant's activities would be in conflict with the law on transport activities," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place on the bus, although two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may crash or brake suddenly the moment the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role to play in whether the bus has a standing position according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologated, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency have no standing places, which was confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jan aura to Aktuáln.cz.
“We tried to find a solution with the Ministry, and at first the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn, and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seat," he said.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant.
"There is no clear legal framework for the role of a flight attendant - there is no legislation regulating this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any law from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds less clearly Hanzelka spokesperson.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn?, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the law properly addresses the problem.
"It depends on whether there is a standing place on the bus's registration.
And that's the end of it," he says.
Buses may be urban, with standing places and limited maximum speed, as well as city-to-city seats and authorised higher speed, as well as long-distance seats without standing places and authorised maximum speed, with seats with seat belts.
Like on an airplane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Hosín, BESIP transport safety expert, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"There are not many dangers in the continuous progress, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
We're not sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
But if the bus suddenly brakes, of course, its physical laws apply.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be resolved by the carrier with internal rules,” he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem has not been solved.
Jancura is ready to terminate the services
Student Agency offers cabin crew services as a single bus carrier.
He's got 200 flight attendants.
The director doesn't think their occupation is risky after the accident.
However, as soon as I get the impression that the occupation of flight attendants is risky, I will eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
That would also be cost savings,” he says.
In his vehicles, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants with security interests.
"We don't have any flight attendants, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end in some kind of fatal injury," he told T.C. less than a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy
A young flight attendant from Plzen, who worked for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop lane without using a direction indicator and blocked the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly tried to avoid it, but the right front of the bus hit him.
The fact that two reserved places for the rest of the flight attendants were sold is rejected by Jan aura.
"These seats can't be booked on long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By reimbursing the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
Law change?
In the distant future
The modification of the law on board the bus could mean a clarification of the movements of the flight attendants, on which the 30-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
“However, the group did not have any concrete results.
Buses are not so much, but rather the point system deals with the maximum permissible speed on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says expert Ho “ín.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka concluded by saying that the control of bus safety is the responsibility of the police and labour offices.
Düsseldorf's hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s board to the bank’s staff is not lacking in big words.
The merger between the banks of the Düsseldorf financial institution and the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create a “central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group”, writes the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a link could provide a decisive boost to further mergers in the Landesbankindustry.
This is the reading of a board trying to prove its ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the insecure WestLB bank continues to be under enormous pressure.
Not only on behalf of the EU Commission, but also on behalf of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that it is on the verge of finding a lasting solution.
However, for savings bank clients, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has been a topic for a long time - also from Frankfurt.
As early as the end of August, when presenting the half-yearly data, Franz Waas, head of Deca-Bank, informed us that the merger between the bank on Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not make sense.
Nevertheless, the Board of Directors of Deca, which consists of representatives of provincial banks and savings bank associations, commissioned the Board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
However, the negotiations, they say, have only just begun.
With its 3,000 employees, the name of Deca-Bank, one of the most important employers in the Frankfurt financial sector, is not the first to arise in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that Deca-Bank was merging with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this triple alliance did not turn out to be anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessen Provincial Government spoke against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deca-Bank and provincial banks has been raised again and again.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Helaba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, there is a need for convergence between the various banks in the public sector.
Now, following the Bavarian provincial assembly elections, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected for the first time.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, he may slowly run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger business partner, even though the financial crisis has so far been significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen with an 85% share in Helaba at the beginning of the year.
Otherwise, NordLB will remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings and Jury Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should be used to secure the future of provincial banks.
Finally, it is possible to dismember WestLB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also discusses that they are definitely looking for a "full solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of each unit with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser - branded five - litre barrel, stands a man with a strong beard and insists on the depth of his throat for some 200 travelers to Oktoberfest.
Elena first flicks Luca's face, then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova Railway Station at 23.45 p.m. to "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans started to sing next to their flag, and they started celebrating during the night.
And it’s so loud that it’s not for Italians,” says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing long, artificial fur coats and wide silvery glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, and he's organized three trips this year alone.
At night there, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 22.30 home.
Accommodation would be just an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer brewed in accordance with the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, accident insurance and German language guide - Marco completed a German language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already throwing themselves into the night on the highway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus calms down quickly, the passengers sleep.
It's okay, they'll still need their strength.
Brixen and Holzkirchen are taking a break, where many Italian buses take a short break before Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 p.m. as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one last briefing, presenting the battle plan.
First, everyone put on their yellow hats.
On the left side of this is the "Oktoberfest" in fractural letters, next to Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the gates of the beer tent open, run," Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we're stuck, and let's not all sit at the same benches with yellow hats, but let's spread out in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your place, they'll take it!"
Third, "You're back here tonight at 10:30 sharp." Do you understand?
Let's go to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men binds yellow hats to trees, signs, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bavarian people’s parties.
You have to be prepared to retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no exact figures; they are talking about 50,000 people who cross the Alps in the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors to the weekend are said to come from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers helping the Bavarian Red Cross, with some 200 medical care in its national statistics, the Italians taking the first place, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British who are at the bottom of the podium (about 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbr au beer tent is particularly popular.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Fortunately, the politician used the word "relatively" and even included in his statement that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Munich-based real estate firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that credit subsidies amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
It's about the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a newspaper report, Depfa, which finances the state, lent money to long-term projects and refinanced itself for an extremely short term - which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves fell by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the equity ratio fell moderately from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Current revenues and net revenues from cash business fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, with revenues from claims credits and specific securities and the liquidation of loan business provisions falling by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex post accounting costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the levy decree and the business for the companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state investor first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
As the classical state funding made little money, Depfa invested more in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private investors and the State (private-public partnership, PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate now has to make descriptions that have a "substantial impact" on the group's profit and loss account, they said quite generally.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
Dividends have already been reduced to a third by 2007.
Since the takeover of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure funder.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on interbank market refinancing because it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending of banks to each other has dried up because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets every year to refinance part of the Depfa loan portfolio, some EUR 50 billion.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered for a reasonable period of time and the company is protected from "the influence of the currently highly inoperable international financial markets."
According to other sources, refinancing will be secured by the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Management of HRE, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) believe that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now ensured.
This gives hope to the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incalculability of the crisis, they can't be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that funding should not be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After late Saturday night’s news that the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not calm the mood.
The share price fell by 75% to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, bond prices are quite good.
While the first-ranked debt hardly changes, the exchange rates of the lower-ordered bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis affects, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities extending beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds used to be a speculative investment alternative, their value stability must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost brought the crisis to the house by taking over Depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less-vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start with the timely repayment of annuities.
Or else, what almost no one currently dares to hope is that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports related to partial nationalisation, the probability bordering on certainty has now become merely a legitimate hope.
Long-term lenders may have sleepless nights deciding whether to part with their investment.
Short-term investors can, however, use the sale to form a reserve for taxes on exchange gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Inside Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German chick is a total kavaí!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - in the new exchange student blog, she talks about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan.
I was so nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and I travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschoo.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to squirm from eight o'clock until 8:40 a.m. a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room".
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform yet, I wore an old skirt of my hostess, a blouse, blue knee stockings, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the caterpillar in this dress and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and it's my birthday in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering and giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavai."
I already knew that from my manga.
It's part of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
And then I quickly swam to my place.
The girl next to me smiled wide, and she felt honored to have the exchange student seated next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran right into me.
Everyone was talking and laughing, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - even though it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their insides.
My host also prepared such a lunch for me - it is completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, salad made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some kind of tofu wrapped meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange and has a completely new taste.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, except for the salty plum stew, brrr!
In Japanese schools, Bento is not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a Bento made with her own hands, which she puts together especially artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe it here.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because he just charms me."
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture described in them, I started learning Japanese at some point.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to travel here at some point.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're very precious here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have emotions, too.
A rat or a moth is on the run in case of danger. Does that mean you feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have emotions.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
Famous scientists have been publishing their articles in the Internet magazine "Edge" for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE is looking at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without proving it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as we look at other species and examine the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: pretends to be dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, circuits related to human consciousness almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and execution/management functions).
This wide area is more advanced in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely absent in other organisms.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the knowledge of who we are, or the ability to design and decide, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of the human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if consciousness did not depend on language, language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then his research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my discussion relates to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is probably more accessible to science.
The processes of consciousness of animals, regardless of their content, could be examined, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this assumption examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What does this mean for emotions?
This is due to the fact that an emotional system, such as fear, is activated in the brain aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies a working memory.
Thus, emotions are closely related to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and, in particular, humans.
In addition to the linguistic form, perception is divided into fine degrees, because with the help of words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states in order to describe them to others in addition to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the areas of body perception of the cerebral cortex and the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it can easily play a role in the emotions of species.
In theory, I can't deny that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is probably also felt in both cases: How can you check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in the same way?
A cockroach escapes in case of danger, does he also feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparisons help: rats and humans have similar brains, cockroaches do not have brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proven in humans, how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, and maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising at the neural level, if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't research language and consciousness, I don't research emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
To others, this may seem like a short-sighted attitude, but I'd rather move forward than keep hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunik said that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees in UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux the confidence in Ukraine and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine, together with Poland, is capable of organising the European Championship,” Vasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
Both host countries are lagging behind in terms of the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at top speed now," said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Federation.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they took an even more radical step.
Following a number of scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN association, which was replaced by independent supervisor Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslav Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
“We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini that this will not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 European Commission.”
Only last season, several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class for manipulation, and finally the leaguestart had to be postponed.
Indignant Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to promote a new film, in the interview she talked about her private life - and now she has a problem with her ex-husband.
The One Who Slaps and Strikes Back
The War of Delayed Roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors fight each other uglyly seven years after their divorce - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with InStyle magazine last week, said for the first time about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, causing me a lot of pain."
And it wasn't until after the divorce that he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him with.
The psychological striptease took place because of Ryan's press work on his new film "Women," which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to his cry of infidelity: "It's terrible," the 54-year-old actor said to the New York Daily News, "to repeat and respend the story of our relationship."
In addition, it is "deplorable" that 16-year-old boys, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the much pain and change that divorce causes a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and recently became the father of a twin.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following sidecut: "My life will continue in any case.
I am happy to have a wonderful family in which everything is in order.”
Reduced prices of air tickets and hotel rooms
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50% cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have again become more favorable - so the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider can be summed up.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the price increase in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices on the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason for this is seen by American Express in the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to "the slowing mood of American tourists to travel".
The decrease in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26.3 percent increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
There was also an increasing trend in air ticket prices in the first quarter.
Due to the increased cost of kerosene, passengers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-haul flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2%.
Between April and June, prices of tourist-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but prices in business and first class only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent and decreased by 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany has halved.
On the one hand, the reason for the price decrease lies in the moderate economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe is increasing the pressure on competition.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their loss-making flights and a number of airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone it affects 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV came to the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still can't find the working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only in the game late, and his raise bounced back from the goalpost.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the Hamburg arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been HSV's physical therapist for nearly three decades, with more authority than some former players.
So his request was heard at the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
His command could have been the same: Give me the second goal!
The order was not executed.
"It wasn't always a beautiful sight today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt also had a more relaxed idea.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) goal result is due to the head of Mladen Petric in Hamburg (11); and to the fact that the very weak Gladbachians could not cause pain to the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the projector, which represented their team as the top of the championship class.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
He knows that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself thanks to its late-committed compositions - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the FC Bayern's Jansen, but it is not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and deviousness," Jol demanded.
After the vote down
Wall Street is filled with fear.
As a result of the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow got a little stronger.
At 8:30 p.m., the most important barometer in the world was down by a good 5 percent and stood at 10,579 points.
Nasdaq, a tech paper trader, fell by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by Bank of America with a 12% loss.
Not a single piece of paper was strengthened.
Goldman Sachs shares fell nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days earlier did Warren Buffett buy a stake in the bank.
In the framework of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage securities.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the State would receive share option vouchers from financial institutions, which could be redeemed if exchange rates were to evolve properly, reducing the burden on the public purse.
European and U.S. stock prices are down
Billions in aid to European and American banks do not dispel investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German big bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and taking Dax with it.
The US Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the state-planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank pushed the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The value of Munich's real estate funder's stock fell to a quarter despite the rescue operation by the federal government and private banks, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax sank below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and recorded 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent minus.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, i.e. 3.3% to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote can take place on October 1st.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2% weakening, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index lost 506.43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595.75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor's shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheimer listed 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also said Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has puzzled scientists for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The fuel lines that are about to freeze are threatening to freeze to death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational rocking of space probes, during which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave fully as expected under the ancient law of gravity.
Instead, there are anomalies in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
Physicists have not yet found an explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which perceives the gravity of matter as the curvature of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to firmly believe that Einstein was not wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter that astronauts discovered in the universe.
“The anomaly could be caused by dark matter, which may be found all the way to Earth,” Adler writes.
The existence of dark matter was only discovered by space scientists ten years ago.
Evidently, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed to affect other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that one-fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists who were taken in Egypt are once again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded millions of euros in ransoms.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostage takers were said to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
Over and over again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
Welt Online reports on the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
This has been reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media.
According to the Italian Sky TG 24 television station, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our comrades and the other hostages were freed.
We are currently investigating their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian national, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, Egyptian state television reported.
19 participants of the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the release of the hostages remain unclear: An Egyptian security officer said that the hostage takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisedly killed six of them.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom,” the official said.
"The trial was only about taking the hostages" when suddenly "the surprise" occurred.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers and arrested two in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The Al-Masri al-Jom newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers will release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men are held captive by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
'Suicide' caused by stepfather violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had raped her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians County, Cornwall, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The criminal court in Truro has learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote: "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, it was said that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 in the Mutley district of Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied and blindfolded his eyes before intercourse while his mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and chose Cornwall as his place of residence again.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to be passionate about surfing and cycling, said her friends said she was "emotional dead" and "resigned life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got into a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter: "I always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
But even more thoughtful is the fact that if he hadn't done so, the case might never have been brought to justice."
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to Stephanie’s parents’ assessment of the impact your crime has had on their daughter over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she'd probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
Officers who lost important data have been charged.
According to the BBC, a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June is accused of violating official secrecy.
The man was on an expert mission from the Ministry of Defence when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional wrongdoing.
Frank Gardner, a correspondent for the BBC Ministry of Defence, said the move surprised many at Whitehall.
“They thought the Department of Defense and the government would treat this as an internal matter,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, was charged under section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about the preservation of information.
The state prosecutor's office has proposed that the Metropolitan Police represent the official's charges for his rather sensitive work on the Unified Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and then moved from his home to an unknown location.
Home Builders Pay B&amp;B's Account
Britain's housing cooperatives can expect an account worth more than GBP 80 million after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government has spent 14 billion pounds on protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositor money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), it is "an annoyance" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion-pound loan will eventually be reimbursed after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are among them.
It is annoying that institutions that have already acted prudently ... now have to pay the bills of institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We learned that each company has to pay the amount of the deposit it holds. The companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan will reach 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to set aside 81 million pounds to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the housing union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
“It is outrageous that those institutions should pay the bills of the far less cautious institutions that acted prudently during the boom in the housing market.”
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to decide how we can protect housing companies and their members from a substantial bill,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, you will have to pay a full year's interest rate, which can be up to twice the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help organisations without shareholders, eventually the members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
Milk prices rise by fivepence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another fivepence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-penny increase in February and after a survey carried out by a consulting company.
Resellers decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladesh's former parliamentarian's request to defend himself was rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected a request from former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina for protection, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him at large on the charge of extorting 50 million takas (729,700 dollars) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, demands that the country's military-supported temporary government first give him full freedom.
According to reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for treatment, the conditions for release do not make it clear whether he can preserve his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The appeals court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail by saying that it was not necessary because she had already been temporarily released and was undergoing treatment abroad," lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said in a statement.
"We will appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself at large so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
He was arrested last year after the army-backed interim government took over, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Concerns over vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organised polio vaccination program due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the U.N. organized vaccinations in six provinces.
However, they said they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or interfere with the thousands of people who carried out the vaccine.
BSkyB appeal on ITV rejected
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Commission's decision to reduce its interest in rival TV station ITV was rejected.
The Competition Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
In the past, the Commission found that BSkyB’s share impedes competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its share in 2006, effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share acquired by BSkyB from ITV threatened the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervisor, all opposed the acquisition.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV share is a pointless and disproportionate reparation - especially given that the BSkyB said it would be willing to give up its right to vote.
A new investigation into the case of US prosecutors
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of the nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006.
The move followed the fact that the report of the Chief Inspector of the Justice Department on the case criticised the decisions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials heard during the investigation have tried to obstruct justice by lying.
"Serious allegations of possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," said Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to order witnesses to testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys from the U.S. Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the state's attorneys were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it turned out later that the dismissed state prosecutors received no worse assessment than many of their other colleagues, which led many to conclude that there was political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are conducting investigations and court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their position.
The then head of the Justice Department, Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks by the Attorney General because of the discharges, and finally resigned.
Many other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In his report, the superintendent strongly criticized Gonzales' role in the case. According to him, the Attorney General has "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "resigned" his role as a leader, and "conspicuously withdrew" from the process.
He criticises other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to Bush Sr., for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Eposza Receives Recognition
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition at the Q Awards Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said he was honored to be recognized.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 audience-successful harvest album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's awards, they were nominated in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
The song by Jim Steinman required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loafé.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
It appeared as a single in 1979 and reached 15th place on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was present on the charts for almost nine years, and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, is currently suffering from health problems. Among other things, in 2003, he had surgery because of his arrhythmia after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts because of acute larynx.
Later, it turned out that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street, which is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, and other side roads. Some of them are famous, others are merely practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-time residents here would find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is located, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, and it's heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it is much more like a dusty alley than a main transport route.
There are no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find on a standard map.
However, the street has its admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to re-envelop Extra Place and make sure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be reached in a cleaner way.
Among the admirers of the street are the long-standing neighbors who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that it was the only remains of the area's past before the renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city.
This month, at a meeting of the district government's area management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city’s management and asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district manager of municipal body number 3.
“There are very few areas in the city and we want Extra Place to remain in the city,” he said.
“There may be proposals for renovation and management that Avalon can make, but we also want to ensure that it remains available to the public.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-envelop the small street and equip it with seats. Some of these would be used by a cafe, which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
“Avalon Bay’s main focus is to renovate this degraded alley and turn it into a pleasant public place,” he said, adding that the city had proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office's job was to develop buildings, not manage them.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has little historical significance.
According to some, it was named "no man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back exit of CBGB, the punk-rock monument closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most famous of all that the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia" was taken there.
"It was a great venue," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothes, pieces of barrels and posters, as well as leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took possession of the East Village, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, which is a practically unchanged piece of the city and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" ("Book of Lamentations: Bitter Nostalgia Looking at the Process of Extinction of the City"), posted on his blog part of the story about Extra Place published in the "City Rumor" section of the weekly "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows, where the wind carries one-week-old newspapers in the canals."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street by the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and an empty, 0.75-litre beer bottle lay next to a discarded, fresh newspaper pile.
Some passersby said they rarely think of Extra Place, but they think it could use a renovation.
Fields said he thinks some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies and senior director of education research at the Pacific Public Policy Research Institute, is co-author of the book "Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's education proposals are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and that’s true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama’s education plan explicitly supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, will overcome his interest in overcoming major performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contract elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of fourth graders performed excellently in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills, and rejection of excuses.
Furthermore, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is to "fully immerse" English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We've had a sweeping success in walking into a classroom without noticing who the student was who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months earlier."
"It's working," he said, "it's working for us."
Would Obama set an example for other schools with a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English-speaking students, such as Sixth Street Prep?
The results of the school should be clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it itself consistently stands up for bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama recently disdained the issue when he said that people should not worry so much about the "exclusive Englishness" of legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to narrow the gap between results, he should seriously study models that work instead of looking down on them and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday because of concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks dropped seven percent to $99.80 a.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity exchanges have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before falling again under the influence of immeasurable uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, the concern again captivated investors even after congressional leaders announced that they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest in history.
The news was clouded by concerns that the financial crisis would not end for a long time.
As the latest event of the unfolding crisis, Citigroup will acquire the banking business of Wachovia Corporation, the government announced on Monday.
In the meantime, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of desperate weekend negotiations, "it seems that the rescue operation has failed to revive the stock market trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for commodities, such as oil, will also fall.
“The future of the stock market, interest rates and currency exchange rates around the world has become uncertain,” a Deutsche Bank analyst wrote.
“We believe that the commodity market will not escape the ‘epidemic.’
The biggest question for the commodity market is to what extent the U.S. "sickness" infects the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption declined as a result of the slowdown in economic growth, bank analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
In the second quarter, the team set a record.
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, playing in the defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the lukewarm game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was in full harmony with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave a 12-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles. This became the perfect forerunner of an afternoon in which their cooperation developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell in a row 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the trouble," Favre said of all the passes he gave Coles.
"Hell is a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis caught a bad pitch and threw it back 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing moment in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets scored it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, thus setting the 34:0 result.
This was the best result the Jets have achieved so far in a quarter.
When the Jets coach Eric Mangini was asked to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter Cardinals scored 21 points without Jets winning any - Mangini said: "I have to say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
We scored a lot of points in a short period of time.”
The rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
Once again, the Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie showed why she was considered by many to be the best mid- and long-distance runner ever, when she broke her own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making her the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on a comfortable flat track in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous result of 2:04:26, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record of her career in so many areas that she won the World Championship or reached a world record in almost every run from 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, which, in retrospect, may have proved to be too cautious, fearing that air pollution would exacerbate his asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, initially at 9 degrees and at the end at 13 degrees - Gebrselassie won on Sunday at an incredible speed of 2 minutes 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since non-marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, his two calves cramped and he couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusted.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
He received some criticism, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival, that he uses too many aids in his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, relies on his pacers as if he were running on track and puts world records ahead of competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint at 1:02:04 on Sunday with the help of four Kenyan pace runners.
Two top Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the pace runners were tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers ahead of the finish line, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who finished second with 2:05:36, improving his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Kazakhstan-born Irina Mikitenko, now a German citizen, ended a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with a 2:24:14 result.
He was unable to participate in the Beijing Olympics because of his alleged back injury, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes.
He won the race with a clever calculation: for the first time he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and after running about 30 km, he went after them.
Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with a time of 2:21.31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop came third with a result of 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and ordeal of the blacks
In the adventure park in Greater Orlando - a few miles from everything that gleams, loud and powerful - there hides a quiet small town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to integrate into the country, and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as it described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guavas and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage place now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville celebration series is held in honor of the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Federal Writers' Project of the Crisis Age, is separate from its surroundings.
As independent, dignified and closed-minded as it was in the 1930s, Hurston wrote that urban blacks in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of views on the racial issue, many here are distrustful of the glances of outsiders.
“We are very careful about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, who has lived here his entire life and is a member of the city’s oldest church.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by the paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of black stand, but at the same time a community of nearly 2,400 people, where poverty rates reach twice the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the sometimes despised, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the inhabitants here are proud and defensive at the same time.
And the image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone here calls Hurston that).
In books written in honest, strong dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook transformed the city, which lies along Route 17. This road leads from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the venues of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, on a brown basis with a white border, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller takes care of, although he can hardly read and write."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed at the temporary shelters."
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description was not liked by everyone.
“Zora told things as they were,” reported 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls. Hurston immortalized them by quoting the slippery songs men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living eccentric who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston stormed into town, he usually arrived unannounced in a roaring Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing long pants in a city where people are still proud of their dignified clothing.
Most people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were forked.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that Eatonville, along with most of the world, had forgotten about it.
Although she was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorations or large public readings.
“I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all,” said Valerie Boyd, author of the 2003 Hurston biography, “Wrapped in a Rainbow.”
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorway connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles of racial mixing gave the community a taste of hatred.
“At that time, a group of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at people on the side of the road,” Franklin said.
"There was a woman who died from this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's decision to force integration, saying of the "Brown v. Board of Education" decision: "It offends rather than respects my race."
Today, residents say that although desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles and undermined young people’s self-confidence.
“Black children are used to being hugged – I remember – by a teacher in the morning and in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, executive director of the non-profit organization “Preserve the Community of Eatonville.”
“This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place,” he added.
“We didn’t hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher – I mean there were cultural differences between us,” Nathiri said.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston rise - in black writers, actors and artists who have overcome prejudices, as she has, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
It is incomprehensible to me.”
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, a respected Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway was placed on the shelves of bookstores, which once again placed him among America’s role models.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was once again at the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county would destroy with its main road.
Thousands of fans have come to the opening event two years later, and many have returned to the ceremony every January.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
“The five-tracking of the main road has revived the community and brought it to full speed, which is a real civic pride,” Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city's image of itself.
An increasing number of people outside the city appeared, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began attending church here in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) was opened on Kennedy Avenue, re-covered and beautiful.
Eatonville remains Florida's cuckoo egg: it's less than ten kilometers from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; it's as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still welcome the outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things, such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, painted by a white man and depicting blacks working in the fields, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate community will be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with his problems and everything, neither better nor worse, just as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is an honest civil bond in the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work for the local government or the police, which he believes need help.
And it seems that younger people have also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing compared to the others,” Alondra Kenon said on Sunday.
“But if you stop and take a little time to get to know your history, this is a very beautiful city.”
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstand booths and the huge television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices over their heads, the bankers and venture fund managers who control New York have been living the most difficult days since 1929.
Couriers still rattle their metal tea carts down the sidewalks, carrying trays filled with muffins for morning meetings.
There are still Spanish - speaking men shuffled among the blockhouses, carrying like a human mule 50 or so ironed shirts hanging on a yoke-like noose across their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning sweet pastries at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on weekdays.
I didn’t feel any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Even though I was deliberately planning to settle the matter in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank during the afternoon’s calm, there were about 20 people in line before me.
Not at the bank teller's window, where money can be taken or paid, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the banker "assigned to me" - lined up with the same intention as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit unions, and small-town savings banks that operate in only one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have been quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in capital, has been in receivership, and when New Yorkers left on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made a savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop workers before me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, a bank that makes the most capital injection buyouts on Wall Street.
Over the past few weeks, ordinary people in New York have become experts in finance.
A woman at a local Chinese store on her phone talked about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO Dick Fuld as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed janitor on my apartment block in his fifties, has changed the subject, and we're not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment, as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, at which the organization "Citys Against the Rise of Islam" was introduced.
They marched with signs imitating traffic signs depicting mosques crossed with a red line.
According to police, far-right extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when far-right parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols with spray paint, such as the Star of David, on some graves, but investigators say they were just trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is related to the elections in any way.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the grave desecration that took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience check following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the political balance has tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which won almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Future of Austria, a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18% of the votes, also expressed his disapproval of the food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the final general assembly of the party in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" that would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that brought victory to the far right, the change was due to the largely young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter banned from traveling abroad
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of raping children, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities that he intended to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police obtained a travel ban on Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of convictions for child rape against Glitter.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, 25 September, Kent police filed a request with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd's planned trip to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he was obliged to do so by the law on the register of sex offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before your planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they don't want to talk about individual cases within Glitter County and possible whereabouts.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children both within the country and abroad.
“In our opinion, it’s easier to control someone if they don’t leave the UK because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police is to protect the population of Kent. Through close cooperation, we constantly monitor the behaviour of those who are registered as sex offenders and who live in the county to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for raping a 10- and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The authorities in the country wouldn't let him pass the passport check, so he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to court in West London, Uxbridge, because, according to Scotland Yard's application, he was entered in the register of sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the UK in 1999 for possession of photographs of child rape.
According to a source at the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Home Affairs, welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I don’t take photos on stage because I want to present the artist from a personal point of view.” – Günther Bauer
No sets, no ruffles, no dance shoes.
The great masters of flamenco at close range, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments far from the audience, when we can look at a personal movement, grasp the depth of a caught look, or marvel at the beauty of the passive but expressive hand of the artist who is not preparing for his performance on the stage.
In his photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, Germany, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, flamenco presents its unique iconography from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco," the creator believes, adding that Flamenco-people "could be anyone, as the images make the observer realize that these images do not typically depict artists.
These people caught on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and capture the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera."
With the momentum of the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer started his long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
These portraits evoke classical photography thanks to the camera and the choice of subject.
However, the use of various stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes day by day and is always fascinating."
It's not the dance, it's not the song or the music in itself, it's the artist's personality and character that charms the audience.
In recent days, the main motif of the works you can see in the El Fotomata gallery is the search for an encounter with its essence, the artistic enchantment, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and presentation.
The well-known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the hallmarks of this photo collection of almost 60 artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in an album covering portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits two years ago encouraged him to repeat the idea with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
People you meet, people you meet, people you sometimes don't even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take a picture.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition entitled Flamenco-people, selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, can be seen in the El Fotomata Gallery, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa says the novel he’s working on is “quite reckless”
The location and plot are unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for 20 years and visited Amazonia.
The writer who also won the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that his current work is "ready recklessness" and "all signs point to the fact that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I hope to get to the bottom of it sometime," he ended his talk at the festival of ideas, ideas and exchanges, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in the city of Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the celebration of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our mutual friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo theatre.
Félix Romeo was greeted by a dedicated audience. For the public, the hour quickly flew by, during which the Peruvian writer told with amazing memory and a great deal of humor how his writing profession evolved from the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how he bridged the lack of inspiration with a disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, many improvements and rewriting; how he inspired Victor's writing; how he inspired Victor's writing.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books would change our lives, but he added: "I don't think literature is just fun or a flower-life experience", because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and take responsibility for their profession.
Due to the bad weather, the farewell to Pozoblanco is shorter, and the horse bullfights are cancelled.
The horse bullfight, traditionally held as the closing stage of the Pozoblanco holidays, was cancelled yesterday morning after the future horse bullfighters found the arena unfit for the fight.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfight.
The weather conditions greatly damaged the series of celebrations, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bullfight was missed because of the rain.
The future main characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought bulls from Castilblanco.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took home three ears as a trophy. After a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante gained a number of recognitions and trophies through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than to his own performance.
After that, however, El Juli, who contributed little to the enhancement of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable ride, most of the audience was able to get out of control.
In Álava, a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape road traffic control
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Territorial Police carry out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armi?o (Alava).
The authorities will stop a van with two passengers trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, was not noticeable at the same time.
Investigators have pursued the passengers and arrested one of them, a 28-year-old man, and identified him as A.A.J., the Basque government's Home Affairs Department said.
The arrested man is accused of drug trafficking and forgery.
The case took place in the administrative area of Armicón, where the staff of the Álava Traffic Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly threw gas, and then left the inspection site.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few kilometers away on the shutdown lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after inspecting the Iveco Daily van, they seized its shipment, 2,178 kilograms of hashish.
The hashish bales that filled the rear of the vehicle were transported by police to undergo a more thorough examination and measure the drug.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the vehicle's fake license plate does not match the data in the van's papers, so the arrested person is also prosecuted for forgery.
The Basque Regional Police continues the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect, who, as already mentioned, fled the highway and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours the court measures began.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police in Santa Barbara, California this weekend because she was driving under the influence of medicine.
According to one witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, a spokesperson for the California traffic control told People magazine.
According to the witness, around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "pressed the gas to the floor, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forwards and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also notified the police because he was "worried about Locklear's life".
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"She seemed upset," so patrols took her to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately. The spokesperson also said that from the first impression of the officers, they thought Locklear was under the influence of drugs.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. He was transferred to the local prison around 7 p.m., where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where his anxiety and depression were treated.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU Secretary General and a representative of the United Left, said today that the regional federation of the unit will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of abusing his position to benefit his family members.
“In these matters I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter certainly falls within the competence of the Andalusian organization,” Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that when detecting irregularities that Silva may have committed, "transparency" should be borne in mind: "At IU has always advocated that such matters be maximally transparent."
He added that the training included "a strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May Blood" by Garci
Benito Pérez Galdós' National Episodes inspired José Luis Garci, who evokes the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in the May blood, which, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flood of people and social analysis he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist. Today, at the film premiere, Garci told the audience of actors with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría.
The more than two and a half hours of May blood will be presented in cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will screen it as a mini-series for more than four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós' literature, realized his childhood dream with this shooting. All thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story can be based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million-dollar budget was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and was a special opportunity for Garci to present "the confused Spaniards who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, as the struggle for independence pushed the country into a huge backwardness with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regretted that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which was more than double the blood in May. As a result, he was forced to miss a few scenes from the script, which, as on many other occasions, was recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So the director of Restart resorted to his usual method of working, recording the scenes with the actors with whom he started the rehearsals before shooting. Casting was not, because Garci considers it "humiliating", and because, as he said, "the director's craft is part of going to the theatre and cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we work in."
Several actors of the May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrasaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not appear in front of his camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the May blood, the Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected Blind Sunflowers, do not represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented," he said.
Garci doesn't expect any awards with this movie.
“In the beginning, you think you’re working for posterity, and then you realize that success is all that matters, and in the end, you’re happy to make another movie,” Garci says with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tortola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women’s equality, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that inhibited the freedom of female movement.
He sparked a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, he recommended Tortola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, "butterfly dance" to guajira, or "snake dance" to tango.
"He danced sensually and others say it's my style," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the Open Door, now sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm happy that you said yes to the request, it's a great honor to have you perform in my play."
In addition, musical directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, singers Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón, percussionist El Pájaro, violaist Rafa El Viola, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the constant character of the true diva with his love."
The play also largely presents the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe and travels to distant landscapes at that time, including India, the United States, or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but they don't know him anymore and they don't appreciate his work," Bayón says.
The performance starts tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet" appears.
The first illustrated edition of The Diary of a Newly Married Poet will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their two deaths.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium will end with the reissue of this work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the memorial house of the Nobel Prize-winning poet and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Poplar Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York for the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that.”
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in the film Victims of the Sensation, and reflects the shock and helplessness caused by Newman's death in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was to get an Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
and he was known to be ill,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I've lost a good friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid that he might become ridiculous or overdo it.
One of the heroes of cinema and the country went away in a particularly dark period, overshadowed by the fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times like these are tough and many people lose their virtues and there are very few people left to look up to, you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he truly embodied the idea of platonic beauty and truth.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation in memory of his firstborn son who died of a drug overdose to the creation of his domestic organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that had a hard time overcoming its suicidal feeding culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration has traveled all over Hollywood regardless of nationality and origin.
According to the last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, not a man, but an era died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few people who are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: they require honesty and serious privacy away from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in the midst of today's media jungle.
There are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He was divorced once, but then he was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, even though he would certainly have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why should I eat a hamburger somewhere else if I have roast meat at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
“None of his performances were as proud of him as the role of a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted philanthropist,” they say.
The Road to the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may be 2016.
But, I ask you, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we're starting from yesterday's race, I don't think we are.
They called it the perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of many I've ever been to.
It was marked by a lot of nonsense, and if I had to be evaluated and be the examiner, it would clearly be a failure.
Let’s go first and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the receipt of the serial number, which meant that it had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at the same time (including the chip, to avoid later queueing).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first, only the serial number was handed over (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual line), what a surprise, only an S T-shirt (second nonsense, since I have an XL size)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save money and buy only cheaper, small T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go there awfully early to pick up the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from arrival and even had to drop off the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we didn't give up the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more than 40 minutes of waiting even more pleasant, which was accompanied by attempts at populace and stand-attack.
I think we'll have about 500 pneumonias by tomorrow, and some of us, myself included, won't be getting our position with our actual time, because I'm assuming my chip recorded the launch incorrectly.
If you ask me about the perfect race, of course, I wouldn't think of that.
So I think we can continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence that can perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on the territory of the company) based on the information heard from the conversation.
With the help of a camera and a form and facial recognition system, this "reception" can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are - and even remember what they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, he can group those present on the basis of the conversations.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she doesn't belong to the company talking to her, and she's not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's come to visit someone and assures him that he'll come to his aid soon.
All without the big blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, this is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft is changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and include fewer additional programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers had only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented the Spanish wax, given that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming more and more marginalized, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google took the first step to becoming a Windows competitor.
Many people have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to reckon with the "death" of the operating system, not in an absolute, but in a relative sense.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and there is more browsing time than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most of the applications that come with the system?
Sometimes less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
It's less cumbersome, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services more online and eventually become an alternative to Google.
They really need all this, and I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo earlier this month in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster asks them to use the company's browser. "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, in fact, in 2010.
Microsoft is likely to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the mobile phone is increasingly functioning as a computer.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, and Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, as well as one of the basics of the fat gay shopping audience.
And while we're on the list of specialties, we can also recall the peace figure of the weight lifter of the travelling circus with a cocky mustache.
But what are we talking about? It's nothing more than the - typically tight and sleeveless - men's cotton T-shirt.
I mean, the tank, as the English call it, but none of its competitors can compete with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although among friends it is only referred to as "Marcel", which he owes to sport, because according to legend he was named after Marcel Cerdan, a boxer, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton fabric, unisex tailoring, distinctive emblem and the small (almost recognizable) Belgian flag make it stand out among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, sailor T-shirts, baby clothes, mini-sorts - and more - are all part of the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also unfortunate that they should be worn as undergarments.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
He's very similar to his brother, but at the same time he's achieved himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than just some pretty and pretty girl giving her name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris and at the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There's a lot of warmth and mildness in it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We present Mango’s new autumn-winter collection, which was designed with my brother Penelope. In addition, we will take part in the announcement of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' competition and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango. Where did you get your inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the cinema of the '50s and '60s; we took a lot from there.
And then, I often just walk around the city and watch women dress, change and sort their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but in the end, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was little, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and go through my aunt's wardrobe.
Well, that was the Canaan itself, almost equal to an amusement park.
As a dancer, I always tried to keep an eye on my dress.
You know, we dancers like to invent our own style for lessons and rehearsals so that we can have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I'm feeling better than ever, I love the '30s.
I think that's when women really mature, they're experienced enough, and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a child, I've done what I want to do, and it gives me great inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and in fact, I want to be a young mother, and I definitely don't want to miss it.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in great love and happiness.
Let's say a few words about the movie theater, you made a few movies last year that haven't even been shown yet.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and restless, I want everything right away, but of course I know it's impossible.
I can't wait to present The Last Hour and the Search for Christ's Tomb.
I wonder what you think of them...
I understand you made your runway debut with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I have known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization Women for a Better World. I chose two of her own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned off and the proceeds were offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much going on about him, so I know him, and I assure you, half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his work.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Repeated drunk drivers will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is drunk or does not blow into the device.
The proposal was tabled in June and is currently being dealt with by the State Attorney's Office, according to which the pilot project will take one year.
Since the aim of the project is to restore the car to the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Transport Safety, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Automotive Safety Technology Foundation (FITSA) are also involved in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of drivers arrested several times for drunk driving get back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the sprayed air. If it is higher than allowed, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the violator.
A 2007 study in the USA showed that vehicles equipped with these instruments could reduce the number of violations by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from turning into criminal offences,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce it, as the implementation of the legal reform is in the usual way, while the necessary criminal reform would require an amendment to the basic law.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to install the system in school buses, on a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English precision, at 17:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force's Princely Party of Asturias landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already setting, but it was still so fixed that we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were coming to town for an official visit.
- Great, so there won't be an airport transfer for a while... she's from around here or something...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or something.
But the Mexican press knows all about the Princes of Asturias and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, a cordon made by 27 sailors who protect dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, in a sea blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, caught in the wind, in a restrained dress, but not in the usual toe-flashing shoes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
They stop for a moment and smile to the cameras, and then enter the room where the official reception takes place.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are awaited by a talkative reporter on Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Award
The world’s best place to award a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and cool of today’s fashion designers is undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the young talents of the fashion industry internationally.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own-designed clothes in the window of Mango at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost shed tears of emotion.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and has recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is in London.
In the midst of the many events and thanks to Valentino for presiding over the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, the president's table made by Mango at the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who came with a heavy heart and sadness because of the recent death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking ornaments of ELAH. She accompanied Valentin to the main table of the dinner in her honor with her son Luis, nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of the Mango, entertained the guests, and they, along with Baron Rotchil, were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, since they were both given to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own designed pants and shirts, and at dinner she was wearing a sexy long black dress. During the night opera visit to Gaya Toledo's company, she became so enthusiastic in the ballet room that, recalling old times, she snuck up to one of the poles and improvised a grand plie kind of thing.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before that, he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he is almost two meters tall and drives a motorbike - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he told us well in advance that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l. l. l., c'est la vie.
1001, the stress-relieving number
Not a thousand, but a thousand, and there's a way to get out of chaotic and messy everyday life.
Another good news is that they can all be found in a single book that arrives in bookstores on September 30th to bring peace of mind.
The clock rings at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to think about how fast life is being forced into today's world every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome day-to-day exhaustion and overcome problems at work.
No, that number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find the solution that suits them best and can be adapted to their free minutes.
The stress-relieving work is called the 1001 relaxation method and the calm from it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK publishers to bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
What’s more, it provides other ideas that all help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and stress has become a central problem in your life, it’s time to sit back, relax and focus on reading.
People who talk in their dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell me fully awake what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke at night.
In terms of frequency, it can be completely rhapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a disease with high fever) or more regular (daily, once a week or once a month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night alarms, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, it can be a condition with a high fever, or even an accompanying phenomenon of stress or increased excitement.
In any case, it's been little studied so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, may consist of incoherent words, murmuring, but contrary to all this, it may also appear in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and turn to a specialist. The examination can reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety and can therefore offer a solution.
As mentioned above, it is a benign phenomenon, and consequently there is no cure unless it is associated with another treatable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things you can do, here are some preventative measures:
Make sure that the child remains calm before going to bed.
Choose comforting toys and avoid watching scary or more aggressive TV shows or shows.
Children who tend to be nervous or have difficulty relaxing are taught some relaxation methods to help them find inner calm.
This will help the child to sleep more comfortably.
If he does start talking while we're sleeping, let's try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day, they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be unnecessary because the child is unconscious, but he would get out of sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's actually sleeping and resting longer.
Remember, if you have multiple episodes of severe anxiety, it is advisable to consult a specialist or explore what triggers a high level of anxiety in your child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarer case), do not start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It would be unnecessary anyway, since he is not conscious enough to collect his thoughts during sleep.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but you do not see the dreams associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you hear and the possible conclusions.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes a great deal of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally gained new momentum and won a victory at home again.
Although there was no awesome match, the yellow-blacks were in position several times, one of which they could finally win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot at the gate was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball barely touched the upper corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeusern took the lead, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a distant shot, and then Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain spit, and Diebold also tried to wave Dannemarie's protection with a distant attempt.
On the other side, the players were grouped into a block and defended in the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi was placed in the shooting position.
The start of the second half was crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on the side of Dannemarie. Immediately after that, the first goal was scored: after Diebold's first shot, the Marais of Illhaeusern won the ball with an excellent position and then put it in the gate (53 minutes).
However, the goaler of Illhausern could not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the fight at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last seconds saved some excitement when, after a great hurry, the ball got very close to the goalpost.
Sarkozy Meets with Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen crippled the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistare on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "concrete proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with a meeting of the "crisis committee", set up by Breton fishermen to initiate action against the rise in gas oil prices, as oil prices exceeded the record average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the President of the Republic, said the president would "negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for sailors."
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
They also paralysed the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-Ile were not blocked.
Roadblocks have been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already shown their determination, and at dawn, tyres and pallets were set on fire outside the fuel warehouses at the ports of Brest, while protests took place in Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
For example, in Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre some 20 ships hindered the traffic of commercial ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic in the county of Loire-Atlantique removed the huge Total oil refinery blockade in Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer, however, have decided to wait for Wednesday’s meeting in the Ministry by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will have to decide on its next step and participation at the planned meeting at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries on Tuesday.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues because fishermen refuse to go to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that a ship would only be profitable if the price of diesel fell below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was killed in Connecticut at the age of 83 due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid their respects to the movie legend and actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer will not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company’s president.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is a major player in the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, an insurance company set up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion dollars it has advanced, the Financial Times said in a statement.
In addition to its life insurance and U.S. pension insurance activities at international level, AIG would divest itself of most of its other businesses, the paper said, quoting sources close to the case.
According to the Times, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company’s International Lease Financial Corp. aircraft leasing company, its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
According to the newspaper, however, there is no final decision on the sale.
The AIG must obtain liquid assets quickly in order to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the U.S. government. By doing so, it assumes the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders in the same proportion.
Paris Historique study on the historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index dropped by 6.98% (which represents an unprecedented decrease of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) sank by 777.68 points, closing at 10 365.45 points.
The largest decline in the index so far (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed after the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Based mainly on technology papers, Nasdaq closed at 1 983.73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500's expanded index decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was already indisposed at the time of the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it went deep.
Members of Parliament rejected the provision of funds requested by Finance Minister Henry Paulson by 228 "no" votes to 205 "yes".
Nearly two-thirds of Republicans voted against the plan.
“The market is picking up bad signals because Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza, an analyst at FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market was counting on this plan,” he added, expressing his concern that if such a plan were adopted a few days later, it would be “too late.”
"If the plan is really doomed ... then it will be up to the Fed and other central banks to deal with the crisis and credit conditions will continue to tighten," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
To heighten his sense of urgency, Piegza adds: “Every day that passes, more and more financial institutions go bankrupt” in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking businesses were acquired by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has developed “not only a US crisis, but a global crisis,” adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has recovered significantly.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening and the 30-year-old bond fell from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama wins first televised duel
The first debate between the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaigners alike claimed victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it was not "impressive" enough to stop his popularity from falling: this is evidenced by surveys taken five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better at fighting: according to the results of the poll published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
Among the most calculating, undecided voters, 39% said Obama would win, while 25% expected McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his party partner Joseph Biden's promising Thursday performance. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned this weekend: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts."
McCain, who is in his 70s, never fails to put his own undisputedly vast foreign policy experience first. He also emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that," the attack was repeated several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to run for president,” McCain said.
This is the main attack surface, which is also exploited by Republican TV ads running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was collected and precise.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, but Obama does,” a Democratic ad aired this weekend said, accusing the Republican leader of still not appreciating the impact of the crisis on America’s “street people.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered for the election meeting in the rain in North Carolina.
He did not even utter the words "middle class" or "workers." The turmoil in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy on the verge of collapse.
“Next week could prove to be a turning point,” Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton administration, said Obama had "excellent instincts in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the "final judgment on the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with Senator McCain's support."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock market, he would be able to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans. He added that his primary goal was to achieve the country's possible energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion (470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted by Congress last night.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, following the closure of polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk’s main square to protest the falsification of election results.
Although results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words: "Mr. Dictator, resign!".
Some admit that they haven't even gone to vote: "Why would I have gone? They're doing what they want with my vote anyway," says a young man.
The protesters do not believe that the regime, which sought to present itself well to foreign observers in order to build relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were clear, observers would be able to lift sanctions against the country, which denied visas to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
“They kept us away from the election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count,” said Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the coalition of the twelve parties.
"The changes were only nominal," emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case this is the executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition get into Parliament, it means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to parliament allows them to get a seat on television, meet in the regions of the country and submit bills.
Therefore, the opposition must take the stage in political life, because “dialogue with the European Union must be initiated”.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, is in crisis and we are unable to renew, we risk falling under Russia’s control.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems to be too high and that the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (in which 26% of voters took part in Minsk) gave rise to any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that there was an election here?” asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was the last to be released from prison in August this year, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
There will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in the parliament, and those who are best suited to the leadership.
The silence of the night falls again on October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased to succeed.
Blood is safe again.
Yesterday, Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation. President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Hema-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donor companies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of the people, which was severely shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserve treated by the blood supply service of the Canadian Red Cross was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, the Canadian government, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched an official investigation in February 1994 to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever delayed submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committee to plan a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee was responsible for this task.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: the Hema-Québec serving Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Supply Society responsible for the supply of all other provinces and the two territories.
“When Hema-Québec began operations in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood system,” Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the area, we managed to regain people's trust." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population considered Hema-Québec to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is an extremely fragile thing".
Since the foundation of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its foundation in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease was transmitted by blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, then we need to apply exclusion measures. In this case, we were talking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain damage and therefore inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease was transmitted by blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique was released on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus itself directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies against the virus on which the previously used tests were built.
With the help of the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood with the help of our technical tools, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk that blood donors unknowingly infect blood and that this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting blood infected with HIV is 12 million to one.
In other words, we would have to distribute 12 million blood products until someone was infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to be infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think anyone can now accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, says the number one leader of Hema-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must be constantly on guard," continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that apart from emergency reserves, Hema-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“As the population ages, so does the demand.
Because anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need replacement of red blood cells or platelets.
Ageing of the population also affects the population of blood donors, as the number of people in the network who can donate blood accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, any healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because, for example, they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been to a country where malaria is devastating are not eligible to donate blood for a year.
“With this 3%, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare for us to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that the existing ones age, because after a while they can no longer donate blood.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and make them become regular blood donors.
In today's rushing world, you barely have an hour to go and give blood," Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeball tissues, and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned people.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages Quebec’s only public stem cell bank.
The umbilical cord, once treated only as medical waste, can be extracted from blood rich in stem cells, so it can also be used to treat serious diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“We celebrated a few weeks ago that we included the 1,000th umbilical cord blood sample in our bank, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples every year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who believes that the cord blood collection program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad that they don't have the opportunity to do so" - indeed, because Hema-Québec is not in a position to make this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Football in the semi-finals of Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders 3:1 yesterday in the USL-1 qualifier and reached the semifinal with a total score of 4:3. This was the second and decisive match of the quarter-final in terms of overall results, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second half the two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, hit the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque of the Sounders team was the only one who managed to play the goalkeeper Matt Jordan.
Recall that in his first match on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
Impact is playing Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which lost 3:1 from Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but Whitecaps reached the semifinal with a total score of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadiens' favorite triassic is ready for another season.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won against the Florida Panthers in 3:2 punitive shots last night at the Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the match, scored one goal. Plekanec ended the match with two goals and Kovalev with a goal pass, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warned.
"I need one more game to really feel in shape."
“He tried too hard in the first trimester,” said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the result of the match.
He's got a huge ovation."
Charest's Northern Efforts
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year.
As soon as the Liberal Party meeting was over, Jean Charest had already traveled to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) is seeking victory in the interim election to be held today.
"Repressing our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Quebec Liberal Party in Lévis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the President tried to focus on the substance.
During his performance, behind his back, they projected images similar to "Moulin . images".
On the three giant projectors, stunning images followed: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" of the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at latitude 49) has often been included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
However, the head of state merely explained why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine full of huge opportunities", but he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
It highlighted only a few development opportunities: primarily hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of catching-up countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north there is "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," said Charest.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", "is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
It is not only found in us, but in us," the head of state repeated, stressing that he wanted to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a stage break and looking at the huge map behind his back.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, which has been endorsed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will reconfirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, “we also need to rethink our view of the North in the light of climate change,” the Prime Minister said, speaking of the Northwest Passage that opens every year as the Arctic ice melts.
According to the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec will pay special attention to them and that they will benefit a lot from the plan, especially young people.
The two ministers belonging to the different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was the delegate of the Parti Québécois inungava) have already started to consult with about 30 local communities.
The Interministerial Committee led by Beno’t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) also plays an important role, has also started to operate.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, “not necessarily a summit”, where “a common vision is being created”.
The development of the North would also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, systematic and at the same time environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Just like the liberals of the past, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president on Friday.
One of the adopted decisions proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout dam.
“Our party’s politicians, including the Hydro-Québect founder Godbout, Lesage, who carried out the silent revolution and the national expansion of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he quoted another - true, conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister between 1957 and 1963, "Roads to the North".
Regarding the plan for the dam of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric plant, President Charest pointed out that the plant was planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was greeted by a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his calendar is already full, as he took on tasks at the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party assembly held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thinking. Here it is mainly about "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party in particular demands recognition of the "specific nature of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to be able to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members would have a veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was skeptical of the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, once again raised the development policy in North Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would have gone much further today," said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Mr Francoise Mercure, who was nominated for the Jean-Talon vote to be held today.
The opposition party ADQ supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
“But we want this to be more than an act,” said Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, the Harper Cabinet's minister (by the way, his "justice" minister) took the liberty of calling Louise Arbour "shame" in Canada last summer.
So to defame a woman who has always fought for justice and deserves all our admiration - that says a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This, then, is our government, who, alone from among the Western countries concerned, did not transport his own citizen home from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This is the government that completely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was accused of.
This is the only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer in inhumane conditions.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet show while investigating the guilt of an accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers are also demanding the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this at this time, at present there is an insidious destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper constantly utters this word, which sounds purely empty from his mouth.
So the time has come when morality no longer exists: arbitrarily beating, torturing and imprisoning any Canadian citizen at the discretion of the leader of a government that has been a minority (and what can come after October 14th?...).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that praises virtue, law, and order. They do not see that this government tramples underfoot the values to which our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, the shame is this - do not look elsewhere.
Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Chairman and CEO of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
Following Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a $6 million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called "public debate".
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision - especially in defamation lawsuits - is not based on the truth, but on the law.
It is not surprising that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Is the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate really to destroy anyone whose position is against his?
Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend significant amounts of money on defense and fighting an unequal fight with an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry on the other side.
In such an unequal struggle, by the way, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and make a friendly agreement, not only to silence the opposite, but even to intimidate those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have expressed its views in public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold operates, this is different, in Canada the disputing parties do not usually hit each other with a stick, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have been enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust public opinion, and in one move, it sweeps away requests and letters to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, he ignores the opinion of this public?
In the vice president's mind, this word probably only means well-paid lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even those who disparage others are entitled to freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because they condemn the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilized arguments, not through a trial for silence for many. (In connection with the term "public debate", Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver’s surrealism, Barrick Gold’s policy is an open attack on the freedom of academic research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of every democratic society.
On the whole, the procedure denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and their interpretation, which are the basis for spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss issues that do not appeal to the rich companies of today’s world, who will dare to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
In our university community, we have been able to deal with disputes, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's ill-considered procedure shows that, contrary to its claim, it does not want to have an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada. It is time for governments to finally put in place measures to restrict legal proceedings for this kind of abuse.
Wall Street Rescue: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Bush administration and Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation, which is the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The $700 billion plan, which aims to contain the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds envisaged; new provisions to maintain the number of houses booked for non-payment; access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Congressman Judd Gregg announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a representative for the Bush administration.
“We did everything we could to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“The most important aspect is that if we don’t do that, there will be a tremendous amount of shock, chaos and confusion in the daily lives of Americans,” said Judd Gregg.
The trial has been accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on investors' moods.
They gave themselves a deadline for the deal until the stock exchange opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, however, they expressed that they were not happy that the situation had increased to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed to himself the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions on the preservation of house ownership or the payment of heads of state-assisted companies.
“When we ask taxpayers to take extraordinary steps to address other people’s irresponsibility, that’s not very welcome.
These steps, however, are necessary," he said on an American television show.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another network if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
“What I have read in broad outline is that it is something that we all have to digest and by which we can move on.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
According to the $700 billion plan, taxpayers would use their money to buy the dubious demands of American financial institutions, something at risk, unsellable.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of real estate balloons. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans), then spread to other debt (commercial) securities, and finally caused the freezing of liquid resources and the uproar of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft deal was defeated by a group of Republican MPs last week.
We seem to have gotten out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" tools of companies in difficulty should be provided by the government rather than bought up.
In order for all members of Congress to be satisfied, the plan included a provision requiring that if the government had to bear losses under the program for five years, it could impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion installment would be paid first; an additional $100 billion could follow if the president deems it necessary.
The remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by a new vote.
In exchange for the help, Washington acquires a stake in the supported companies, through which it receives dividends from the profits and can sell them after the crisis has come to an end.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of the property to cover the mortgages covered by the plan. It can also set the maximum value of the salary and severance pay that can be paid to the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on today by the House of Representatives and Wednesday by the Senate.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
There have been repeated objections to the plan by both Republicans and Democrats.
“It is absolutely clear that Washington cannot hear your voice,” Scott Garrett, a Republican member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
“We have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that would benefit the taxpayers.”
Brad Sherman, the Democratic leader of the small congressional group called the "sceptic faction", presents things differently, but he comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economists, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, have written to us asking Congress not to hurry and to look carefully at which path it chooses,” Sherman said.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group worth EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its on the verge of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (US$ 2,9 billion) as a result of the crisis of subprime mortgages in the United States.
With 85,000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
“This is not wasted money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"We will gain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Manche, the British government seems to be about to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the sum of the ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley bank, of which real estate loans amount to 41 billion pounds (75.5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will acquire the British bank’s subsidiaries and client holdings.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has wanted to nationalise since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the Idol
Some say his beautiful azure eyes were his main trump card, others say his main weakness.
Did the American actor with a charming smile ever get rid of his narcissist mirror?
Yes and no.
Through his shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent, he was also far from the loud style that is the essence of the true great monsters of the art world.
But what a great career he's had!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at the age of 83 on Friday at his Connecticut estate, one of the last icons of the American cinema boom.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled, and who for a long time was a rival on the screen. In his roles he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and a mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at Actor's Studio in New York, before bursting into the world of theatre, television and shortly thereafter cinema.
In addition to being at the forefront of civil rights, he won second place in the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1979 as a racing driver. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know the downsides of this mysterious, private, dedicated actor who hated the glamour of show business, which will forever remain a mystery.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked movie fans: in his great roles we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his oeuvre, we have seen the seventh American art, cinema with continuous changes for more than 50 years.
In our memory, the charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the estranged young man from his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), whose role was seen in the Tennessee Williams processing of "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
Recently (1990) we can remember him in the form of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who, in his old age, faces the fact that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up There", he performed an unforgettable performance in the role of stormy criminal boxer Rocky Graziano. This role originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Big Trouble", which won the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen played a bitter, vengeful billiard player in his brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961) and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money".
Times have changed, but it's always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by a change in ages.
Younger people know him mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film "Icebreakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, a coach of a hockey team with unconventional methods.
His fans saw him in the Coen brothers' "The Great Jump" in 1994.
The line was closed by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Damnation" in 2003, which was the last to appear in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not view it as "a living rebuttal of underplaying" without humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newman, whose film roles fell into his lap for a long time.
Yet he played young and successful characters less often: rather, he formed figures on the edge of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to restore with perfect credibility.
As a director, he showed a less known face of Newman: deep down, he was a really chaste and sensitive man.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adaptation of the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), she starred in a fine portrait of a melancholy woman with her wife Joanne Woodward.
And with the film "Harry and Son" made in 1984, he commemorates his son Scott, who died of a drug overdose.
Yesterday, many of Newman's admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old warrior Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said with sorrow: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: that was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the struggle for independent film production and Hollywood's debauchery are obscured.
We could see his face smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in his mouth, although at the beginning he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to the foundation for children suffering from the disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father was always and always unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here.”
It is also a privilege for us to be able to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including forgery, which cause particularly significant damage to a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecution, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed by false invoices.
State and municipal money - about HUF 65 million in total - has migrated partly into the cash register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of some people.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the tender money obtained was taken on the basis of cost accounts that were not behind real performance, and the associations never fulfilled the commitment they had undertaken.
According to the indictment, most of the accounts were fake.
For these, the account blocks were purchased on the Józsefváros market, and the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And the names of which companies to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidéki körút to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to the latter's testimony, he had to look like boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, the model of which was then prepared for the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these were written by István Lados with his partner András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote mostly the reports needed to obtain the grants.
One of Lados's "study trips" was a beer house.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, dated 2003, the restaurant provided food for the 90-person group of the Sure Point Association.
However, according to the manager, they would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice issued to the Foundation for a Better Future - later Together for the Third Millennium - in the summer of 2002 was full of errors in form and content.
A pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet the bill was about a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative form fillers also went too far when they marked Pigal Kft., which is also a catering company, whose accounts - according to the information given to the prosecution - did not even include documents for the Better Future and the name of the Oops.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the D.A.'s office and bills were shown to him, he knew immediately that it was false documents.
"Our business name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that in addition to the formal reasons, it was not right that a hundred people were accommodated according to the account, as they have a total of eleven rooms in which there are not so many seats.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant had long since ceased to work.
The zealous account makers did not even look into the fact that the Budapest travel agency they looked at only organizes trips abroad, so they indicated a trip to Hungary as a service on the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's account issuing practice.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, VAT was also included on the document, even though travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the VAT rate was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Better Future, as the company's service is not subject to the indicated 25 percent VAT, but to 15 percent VAT, and the hotel's employees only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" also ruined the account by indicating road freight transport as an activity carried out in the case of a company, as revealed by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on investment advice.
In addition, it was also due to formal differences - not the right account format, not a real stamp - that the accounts for the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point were false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sport Camp, whose representatives denied that the accounts had been issued by them.
For example, the forgers did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association ate there, which is why the company's liquidator denied, as far as we know, that he had issued the paper.
Consciously put out
Another group of account issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious account.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Foundation for the Third Millennium for some HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
Biogate Kft., currently in liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which in 2003 provided the Foundation for a Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Redwood Association with invoices for roughly HUF 5 million, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Nor is it a movement of money, because the completed invoices were then downloaded, but this has already been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing invoices are those that can be linked to the defendants.
Thus, Iván Kubatov was the delivery agent of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer devices in October, November and December 2005, worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted in the course of the investigation that he issued an invoice on behalf of the Ltd. to Atlas, Oops and the Together for the Third Millennium Foundation, and took up their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which, according to the defendant, was because they didn't get a job.
However, the companies benefited because, at the request of Zsolt Szente, his fellow defendant, who also prepared the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations related to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave 15 accounts to organizations worth HUF 14.2 million.
According to the prosecutor, 10 percent of the amounts on the invoices and the VAT hit Kubatov's hand.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, which were manufactured for the application of the Commissioner Point.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted an application to the Socialist Party's public benefit organization, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to reveal this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were found, by the way, during the search at Árpád Kemecsei's office at the education wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the D.A.'s office, are likely to report on the progress of the account production.
Most interestingly, if you are the primary defendant, János Zuschlag decides to lift the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or whether the socialists made a deal with him for the reimbursement of most of the damage, 50 million forints, and Zusi takes the fall.
By the way, he may have been offended today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to put him under house arrest, were constantly on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much more damage and do not compensate for it can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own homes, he does not have the opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overbiding: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been explored by neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be left behind in a type of competition such as eBay auction, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research tried to map the nervous system pattern of this "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery and the other group took part in a player auction while using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method to examine the active brain areas of the subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction game, in which the essential element is the overbiding of the other party, the complex under the cerebral cortex called striatum was intensively activated when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system, among other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price can be explained by avoiding the violent reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they came out of the game winning, they would be rewarded with $15 more.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group also lost this money.
The only difference between the two groups was that they emphasized winning for one and losing for the other.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the "lost" team were willing to bet even higher than the control and "winner" groups.
“These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
So far, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of victory and risk aversion.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the discrepancy between these two theories, and now we have a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of death.
There are 100,000 people infected with hepatitis at home, but only 7,000 are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, spread in two main forms: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (dono, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travelers should definitely be vaccinated against viruses A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected food, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal complaint, nausea.
After that, the jaundice on the skin and whites of the eyes develops, the stool becomes light, the urine becomes dark, and the healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die each year from more severe forms of the disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms occur only 20-30 years later.
Thus, it is very important to perform early prevention and regular screening tests.
There are many more cases in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattooed people.
There are currently 200 million people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth contacting your GP when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognizing in time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating infectivity and preventing the development of cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
If you believe in God, does it hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment to investigate how belief in God affects people's perception of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were given electroshock while they were all studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The study was conducted by attaching a sparking device to the left hand of the subject, which provided the electroshock.
Researchers asked those involved in the experiment to look hard at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci’s painting Lady with Hermelin in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a kind of religious state among believers, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts while looking at either the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as they "kept taking care of" and "rested, filled with peace".
When looking at the religious picture, they reported 12% less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the study himself, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, including atheists, only the right photo needs to be found.
“We should find a picture of someone who feels very positively, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“The practice of faith should, and in many cases will, change our personality,” Wright said.
After the great results, the only question is, if Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber were to show the believers a picture of a madonna, how would that affect their pain control?
Would seeing the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say that people have it in their pockets as much as they have it above their heads in the sky; he knows where they vacationed, what specialties they go to and what they are interested in.
That’s not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s top executives.
As for the skeptics who draw parallels with the Orwellian horror, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about their users, which is necessary to be able to adhere to the original goal of Google founders, which was to "collect all the information in the world!"
According to Google, after ten years of world-changing work, the company is only at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would really suit me?” but until then, software could not answer questions that seemed so simple because they didn’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search engines are accurately recorded in Internet searches, which IP address they were searched from and which page the interested parties left after the search.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing background, look back at what they were looking for and clicked on, and generate much more personalized results for them in the long run - the same logic will be used by Recommendations to offer us products and services based on our previously mentioned and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? – users who are concerned about Google’s data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the amount of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not the fear of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or the rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all search terms are not only recorded, but may also be handed over to third parties in justified cases, and in such cases the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the loudest example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about pedophiles on the social network Orkut, which it maintains.
However, Internet users concerned about privacy rights may have sighed in May when the company, in cooperation with the EFF electronic rights organization, successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI: Google cannot be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought off some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms by referring to the strengthening of the child protection law adopted years earlier, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
So Google's view is rather controversial: it is being flogged by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimacy and privacy are being undermined by the fact that they are starting to use Google's services and are acting against them by rebelling against the multi-company in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users in many countries see in them the next generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", as opposed to its rival Microsoft, who has been declared world conqueror because of Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This may happen because Google does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, continuously kept source code and program package seems much more accessible, youthful, cooler than the official software giant practice.
However, it may also happen that geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which was followed by one of the most frequently spoken keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving clues and exploiting the communication channels available to us, and while these vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can lead a profile from Facebook to Xanga on several social media sites, connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing their musical habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also lead a blog with their latest photo galleries automatically displayed on Flickr or Pic.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases from which it is clear: a girlfriend can easily find out who her cheating friend spent the evening with or can fire a company employee just because he writes his honest opinion on senior management in his blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has been completely re-evaluated by now.
If you live an online life, it consists of what you show yourself, this is how we can formulate the basic principle behind the behavior of today's young people.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly can do so (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system but deliberately leaving no trace).
For example, the number of people who deliberately do not register on social networks so that they cannot be found, Google's online applications can be replaced from word processor to image manager and news reader with alternative versions that do not connect to huge server parks and that do not create the best profile that has ever existed.
The public is not so secretive about when Google will show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an accelerating pace cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers also find these disturbing counterpoints: for example, the senior management completely rejected the protests of the employees after doubling the fee of the company kindergarten, the management found it too expensive to feed the employees on a daily basis, but all of this is dwarfed by the fact that in 2006 Google bowed to the Chinese government and, according to their agreement, the company filters out all the hits that violate the interests of the good taste.
One of the company's internal rules is that they don't announce a new service until it's ready for use, but it's certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is on such a scale that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of our previous health system, and we are afraid of our own health system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also give good material to the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, Scroogled, describes the future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly well from Google's data.
Two juveniles helped the Osdi double killer with the disappearance of the trail
Two juveniles were questioned by the police in the case of the double murder in Ozd, and they were suspected of helping to cover up the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod County Police Headquarters said on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the act they have been charged with, and they are currently accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, according to MTI's information, are free to defend themselves.
Abetting can be punishable by up to five years of imprisonment.
The suspect, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated, profit-seeking, multiple homicides.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to an Ozd site last Wednesday, where he killed him and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing in advance to commit the crime, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the help of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered EUR 200 million - some Czech kroner 5 billion - for the purchase of the 100 percent share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from the possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is state-owned.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in a few months.
The new Czech business newspaper E15 knows that the Polish offer represents the highest amount so far offered by interested parties for the Prague stock exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted bids so far.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of the interested parties, and he did not rule out that this could lead to the termination of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest shareholder of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a share of about 25 percent, followed by Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday’s deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers already refer to “the second September 11th”.
We owe the global financial disaster to the President of the United States - accused by Rome's La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to line up his own party behind the hasty bill aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, which Warren Buffett referred to as a billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, following the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The global economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Today, some states can still provide a lifeline for sluggish financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither funds nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was given to infirm financial institutions, the Vienna Der Standard recalls, according to which the concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, need to dig deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not taken the crisis seriously, which is sweeping through the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescues" do not have to wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they were fixed: in which case it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money in order to prevent more damage.
The flying of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collisions if not to imitate obstacle sensors in the natural world?
The bees, for example.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C type bioimitation car robot control system, a robotic minicar equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety barrier,” explained Kazuhhiro Doi, Chief Technology Officer for PR and R&D at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the complex eye of the uterus, which can see in all directions at an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy its complex eye function, engineers touched on the idea of a laser telescope.
This identifies obstacles within a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an action to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision.
Unlike any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If that were not the case, the car-robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety barrier, a layer within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process should take place in the blink of an eye.
However, other than bees, the deviation cannot be directed upwards, downwards, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the turnability of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the endless possibility for bees to avoid other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration and deceleration were used as an available option for the car robot.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer service life than the lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, instinctive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store it.
This device only needs to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so you are constantly using only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in the development of immediate-emergency technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production cars within ten years.
An additional application can be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It's got a name for the expensive kid.
A written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law to be applied in several instalments to buy bad loans from banks has been drawn up.
In the first round, half the amount is spent.
During the recent talks that took place after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders came to an agreement in the days-long debate around a total of $700 billion in bailouts, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the House of Representatives, who said that the deal is now on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will work and be effective, but further work is needed. Pelosi said that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the fairs.
The draft legislation on the programme, which is called the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilisation Act, will be voted on by the House of Representatives on Monday and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed the news of the agreement.
“We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend $700 billion on low-quality, credit-backed securities.
Now, for the first time, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent by using $250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, from which the Treasury Department buys credit-backed, poor-rated securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, which will include the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new resolution by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combination of tactics: you can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time, as well as other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can be made directly and through auctions, the ministry said.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets of concern, for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the necessary means to provide up to $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a widespread purchase of bad assets, insurance, or avoiding systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, bosses of banks in distress and waiting for state help can expect their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are restricted only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way in which the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys under an auction, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute unless the retired bank manager is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
Part of the picture is that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs, said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk for taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction as the economy and the bank saved with it recovers.
In the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
“This is not what the American people asked us to do, which is not to protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said Darrell Issa, a Republican from California.
His Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures were being urged by the same people responsible for Wall Street’s collapse.
Industrial prices continue to rise
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the HCSO reports.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, decreasing by 3.9 percent compared to a year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month and 3.2% higher than in the previous year.
Domestic sales prices of the industry increased only minimally, by 0,1 % compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly, by 0.1% compared to July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to a 4.6 percent increase in the production of bags and belts and a 2.5 percent increase in the production of footwear.
The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6%).
There was a decrease in prices in the oil processing (1.4 percent), the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, a price increase of between 0.2% and 0.9% was measured.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which has a significant weight in domestic sales of industry, increased by 0.3 percent, mainly due to the transitory effect of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
Compared to 12 months of domestic sales in the manufacturing sector, prices increased the most in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%).
In the metalworking sector, a price increase of 13.2% was observed in the field of food, drink and tobacco production, representing a dominant weight of 11 percent.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile production (2.5 percent) and in the electrical machinery and instrument production (0.3 percent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6% and 9.1%.
In the manufacturing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Electricity, gas, steam and water prices were 18.7% higher than a year earlier.
In August, the sectors producing capital goods showed the highest monthly price increases (0.7%) among the intended groups of sectors in domestic sales.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices have increased by 0.3%, and in the energy and re-use sectors prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent and a price decrease of 1.4 percent for capital goods.
Export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro and 7.1% compared to the dollar, increasing by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Do you need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January – the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "almost everything now depends on the timely establishment of an electronic entry and control system overseas".
At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
He meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will hand over the Star Award and will discuss with the Democratic Party advisors of Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
The bailout package is backed by Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, both supported the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of marathon negotiations, Congress and administration representatives announced at dawn on Sunday that they had reached an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to defrost the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain are more likely to lead the country out of the economic crisis than their rivals.
According to the latest polls, with economic issues coming to the fore, Obama again gained some advantage, melted McCain's advantage after the Republican convention, nominated by Sarah Palin as Vice President.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package law would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
“We need to act now, with responsibility ... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, the stability of the whole economy are at risk,” he said.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain said in an interview with ABC, "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing this (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable option."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the establishment of a committee overseeing the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the severance pay of top leaders, which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would vote on the bill on Monday.
Review of the German language area
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp have voters become more self-aware - so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of the CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter, Bavaria's revolution devours its parents, analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of all Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a state party has ceased.
For the first time since the 1950s, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent in 1998.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistent modernisation of the CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequences for the CSU's loyalty to secularization, educational achievements, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the electorate become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been the most distant from the CSU; liberal professions, industrialists, graduates and graduates of higher education.
Support for the CSU has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily newspaper deals with the confused domestic political situation following the Austrian elections in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The party presidents are restrained in coalition issues".
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to discuss the coalition.
The election has taken place, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders have hardly allowed insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - it exists in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president as Vice Chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party for the time being, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open to all directions.
“To stop the Red and Black Coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of government,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Equal Opportunities Summit began in Paris, hosted this year by France, representing the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz MEP of the European People's Party, in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional meeting, drew attention to educational segregation, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, this is the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
Among those invited to the meeting were representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European human rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are excluded from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and as a result of poor quality primary education, only a small part of them can obtain higher education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can strengthen the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links to the widest extent, including between Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
“Roma must be guaranteed the right to quality education on the basis of their EU citizenship and must be guaranteed the elimination of their low-quality and separate education,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the goal and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary to speed up the desegregation processes in schools, and the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is essential for this.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and Roma children must be given the opportunities offered by the democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens”, Járóka demanded.
As part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last year in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the goals of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
The fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided at the end of October
Despite the ugly election failure, no heads have fallen yet, and at the tops of the Bavarian CSU, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, may still be in place, the question is how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a 17 percent catastrophic loss of votes, will be decided by an extraordinary party convention on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized pair showed that they did not cling to their chairs with all their strength.
By doing so, they tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority the day after the "Bajor tsunami".
Five years ago, led by Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian Social Union gained 60.7%, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only 43.4 percent.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a "dominant" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives continue to count high in the key southern province for the Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced to form a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of the reorganization within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is a potential successor of Huber, will also be included in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start negotiations on a possible government coalition in Munich with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters organised along right-wing values.
It is a strange irony that Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was taken advantage of by the Huber-Beckstein pair as a coup opportunity, then harshly dealt with the ambitious municipal politician.
The CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Stoiber, the former provincial prime minister and former CSU president, will also play an active role in the transition, calling 28 September the bitterest day of his political career.
Huber made some epic comments to the CDU on Monday, saying they deserved much more support from the brothers.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel cannot be chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, is somehow not recovered together.
Merkel, who finds it difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, said that the loss of soil by the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Grand Coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, of course, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will last longer.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result in Bavaria since 1946 by 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
No opposition member has been elected to the Belarusian parliament following Sunday’s elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it can be explained by the illegalities committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the 100-ten-member legislature of the 10 million country has been lacking the opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate as President of the 2006 disputed elections, would "allow" some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament this time.
The ODSZ has thus also withdrawn from the boycott previously considered.
The opposition expectations were due to the fact that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has taken credit to reduce Russian gas imports, and has also contributed to the Russian takeover of Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines passing through the country, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter due to the anti-democratic political system in Belarus.
As a preliminary point of relief, the OSCE focused on positive shifts rather than shortcomings in the assessment of the election campaign, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from running.
However, the OSCE’s quick report on Monday already objected to the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there has been a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in a minor confrontation with Moscow, still refusing to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus has been a federal state on paper, has been considering the two areas independent for a month.
“We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun,” Milinkevich said.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should continue, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to allow even one opposition into the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan protests in view of the results, but rather tries to deliver its message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
“We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are creating obstacles to distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting the change, including among the elderly,” said Milinevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko’s regime, which considers the creation of social security its main achievement, is not considered appropriate even by the most officially supported pensioners.
“Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time before the breakdown of social security, which evokes the silence of the cemetery,” Milinevich said.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers classified the elections as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Community of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi that "people do not believe in words, but in actions", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, revolving doors have been installed in a unique way for the entry and exit of workers.
As of today, this new measure is going to be taken against those who block, and then they're going to have a coffee at work.
The anti-salp news was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
“The rotating gates,” Brunetta said, “are designed to work better and more efficiently, reduce absenteeism and increase services.”
“We are entering a new, more responsible and transparent period.
This is the real reform,” Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
According to Masi, "the installation of rotating gates is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and brioche.
Brunetta smiles and advises: "A good cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning can do wonders."
The Roman College of Public Administration
At the meeting, the Minister said that “in three months, the absences of public sector workers due to illness have decreased by 50 percent, which means sixty thousand more people going to work in one year”.
He added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
According to the Minister, the wage dynamics of which have been twice as large as those of the private sector in the last 8-10 years, and have far exceeded the inflation rate.
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered to join the petition supported by the Italian Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest the Brunetta Regulation.
“While the Minister of Public Administration is boasting of data supporting the reduction of absences due to illness, the army of ‘tiring slackers’ is constantly growing,” the Consumer Protection Association writes.
“Thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff from all over Italy have gathered to declare war on the illegal provisions of the decree.”
The regional administrative court is opposed, inter alia, to the abolition of supplementary sickness benefit for reasons of service, the extension of the period of residence of sick workers at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear, and several other aspects contained in the new provisions laid down by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, of which 3 end in death and 27 end in permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company, there were nearly 1,200 deaths in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and it requires almost twice as many victims as homicide.
For the 58th time, Anmil is organising the Day of the Victims of Workplace Accidents, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October in all Italian counties, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and the mass media to this dramatic problem.
"The alarming data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association of Workplace Accident Disability.
The head of state sincerely praised the association's "persistent commitment to prevention at work, the protection of the interests of accident workers, the assistance of the victims' families and the awareness of public opinion".
“There is a natural and shared outcry of this kind, which by its size attracts the attention of the media and the general public, but in reality we are faced with dramatic, repeated cases every day,” he said.
Napolitano openly admits: "We undoubtedly have a lack of resources, funding education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at directly educating young people on the verge of entering the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to let the social importance of this issue drop, and to have more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
For his part, the Speaker of the Lower House Gianfranco Fini stressed "how serious the social significance of the workplace accidents ending in death is for all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
“The figures for accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still staggeringly high,” Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli said.
“However, we do not want this downward trend to be coupled with a downward trend, because the greatest tragedies occur precisely as attention slows down.”
"We believe that at the general level, we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, we need more supervision and control, Mercandelli stressed, as well as stronger intervention in the field of workforce training from school education."
“Further efforts are also needed to inform and empower public opinion,” he added.
What we need most, however, is a more responsible employer environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
Mercandelli then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation safety net for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the system has been drifting in recent years".
“The aim is therefore to give workers back the safety provided by insurance, because the fate of those suffering from accidents cannot depend on the arbitrary and sometimes distributing measures of the legislators.”
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Permanent hearing loss can be caused by listening to portable player devices for a longer period of time and at a high volume level, such as MP3 devices.
In a report published in Brussels today, the European Commission, the EU’s Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), said in a statement.
“The report shows that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music players at high volume for more than an hour a day for five years may suffer permanent hearing loss,” the report said.
“It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones on a massive and frequent basis are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing,” Kuneva said.
“Scientific assessments indicate an indisputable risk that we urgently need to respond to,” he said.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review the existing control systems so that they can operate efficiently and keep up with the latest technologies".
Brussels asked the independent scientific committee to look into the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they cause.
"The researchers confirm that there is cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to explore possible measures to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," he said.
The current European safety standard defines the maximum noise level that can be emitted by portable music players at 100 dB, but there is increasing concern about data on hearing loss resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, that can significantly reduce these hearing impairments.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for users who listen to music at high volume levels (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum level for noise at work.
If you listen to music for a long time under similar conditions, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of portable device users, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno set up a committee for the future of the capital
It starts today, lasts until March, and the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality of Budapest for the operation of the Committee on the Future of Rome, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will develop Rome's guidelines.
Following the final word in March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee in order to submit the Budapest strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented," Alemanno emphasizes, "and it is up to Rome to develop proposals for its development on which political decision-makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Municipal Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after completing its work, the committee will be disbanded because it has a fixed term mandate.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of Rome.
For those who deem the Commission's work superfluous, claiming that the opinion it has drawn up is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it will put on the table.
If the quality proves to be adequate, as in the case of the Commission of Attal in France, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, the contribution it will make will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the management of daily affairs and in the management of urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further in the long term and plan for the longer term and are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be considered a useless "waterhead", because it is absolutely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a euro, but it will serve as a thought incentive and aim to involve the best minds in the capital".
According to Alemanno, “we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to make the leap it needs so much, thinking in a unified spirit about its future”.
Regarding the future on which the mayor of Rome emphasises that “he will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but will look much further”, we see in him not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital, but also “the role that he can and must play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean”.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, claiming to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had close relations (as he does today as a private person) with hostile Islam".
As the election time approaches, so will the attacks on Obama.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambitions.
“Obama has the audacity to believe he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has had two governors and five senators black.”
These attacks are in fact meaningless; they are of a racist nature, of course, but they do not answer the question of whether he will be a good president. Then here are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and with significant importance.
In this case, too, there are those who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
Inside the southern states, a newspaper in Mississippi wrote in its editorial: we know well who the true American patriot will vote for in the ballot box.
A side of the American way of thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
“Just talk what you want, and we’ll know where to put it, Obama or McCain.”
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they will leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all this speculation, the winning weapon of the Democrats is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked what were the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they threw him in the ass so hard that he flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, the majority believe that Iraq was Bush's weak point.
There's a huge task waiting for the one who replaces George W.
U.S.A.: The economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come for restrictions in the newsrooms. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future at the moment.
However, they did not clearly state that their concern about credibility had been reduced.
They don’t feel as isolated as before.
The problem with American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on newsrooms, or newspaper editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense of what the public means, to shrink to a minimum, this problem must be solved.
Today, American journalism is characterized by a visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives in print are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At the local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press has no difficulty in seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many believe is the "killer" of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” experienced by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to voting for technology in the hope that it might benefit journalism.
Today, in the American press, there is a gap between the editorial leaders, that is, the directors, and the correspondents working for them.
At the national level, 56% of executives are confident that their correspondents share their information with others, while at the local level this figure is only 23%.
Some associate this with secure employment.
At the national level, 47 percent of executives fear losing their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this figure is 30%.
In America, the question of "safe work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13% of journalists have a contract.
In the case of a vast nation like the United States of 300 million people, where there are thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a "must or not should" basis.
Directors usually get a high salary, and editors can earn $10,000 a month in addition to paying their pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x days, in the third, too, until after a certain period of time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often get sick during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: COURT OF JUSTICE OF ROMANIA: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second criminal division of the Roman Court, rejected Danilo Coppola's application to move from his residence in Grottaferrata to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is under investigation for economic bankruptcy in the framework of the Unipol - BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella requested that the real estate professional be allowed to move from the small town to his apartment in the capital.
However, according to the court, these commutings (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow him to influence the company's affairs and have access to the evidence against him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package tabled by the White House: a significant part of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has created a rift within the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided between the traditional, restrained East Coast attitude that supports federal institutions and business circles and the growing new trend against Washington and the financial world in the Central and Southern States.
This line was expressed in a critical way during the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, the above event is only one of the major changes that the economic rearrangement that is still taking place predicts or allows to be seen, not only in the United States, but throughout the Western world and perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-delayed phenomena that have been solidified in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the redeployment, the return of the dual category of state sovereignty to the public consciousness, in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis affects banking and financial institutions that, although having a close relationship with the rest of the world, primarily and quite widely, carry with them people and families who live in one country, one state.
This, in turn, is a direct political difficulty for those in government: how should they respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters?
So the crisis seems to be worldwide in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of line: the European Union, which is unable to set a unified political direction between different interests and different national strategies, is an eloquent proof of this.
Thus, everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but above all the opening of funds: because only the individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that may be able to put things in order.
They have the means and the authority to use them: under the circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that probably no other market or any international organisation will ever have to this extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation-state is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, and were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things like water, crops and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, yet are completely linked to a demarcated place, an area.
So whoever controls the area has much more cards than who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
This leads me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Anyone who says territory, state, government must also say politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two congruent phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, people who can take control of events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially economic leaders, who have proved completely incompetent and have proven that there are many areas of obscurity ahead of them.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of loss of credit, impatience, inadequacy and separation that affects the entire leadership elite in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus, it seems that a growing number of people are convinced that the time of the social elite at the top is over. It has expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, culture, in the complex sense of the word, have been embraced. With this, the social elite is increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, feeds a diverse but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This manifests itself in the unexpected "revolts" of voters, or in recent times in sudden changes in public sentiment. For example, the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of Labour unity in Great Britain, or the victory of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the right side).
It seems that the traditional elite, along with its parties, programs, and even its customs, press, and renowned intellectuals, are less and less able to understand, and therefore less and less able to represent what has been going on in the deeper layers of Western society for some time.
Nevertheless, speaking of “the imminent revolt of the masses” would be frankly an exaggeration.
But it doesn't hurt to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk with super-strong glue on the wall
Using a super-strong glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
With a piece of glue just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to glue a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American journal STUDY - A Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of special nanotube materials that already existed.
“We need to think of the adhesive’s working principle as a package of spaghetti-like tubing,” says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers drew the idea from the gecko’s microscopic folds, which provide perfect grip for the animal.
Tests with different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have confirmed that the new adhesive is ten times more effective than the soles of these reptiles, but at the same time "it easily separates from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's Faculty of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking more of a less impressive use, like connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are good conductors of heat and electricity.
You can find further applications in the field of space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
The other research – the University of California, Berkeley, is also experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a hair-like adhesive made of microfiber material that goes through self-cleaning when moving on the surface, so it always provides perfect grip.
Medications? No juice!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin, especially summer-popular thirst-quenching drinks, when taken together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, amplifying or reducing their effect as appropriate. This can also have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, told the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia at its 236th national meeting that a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice could reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice has already been put on the stand when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rhythm control and nerve medicines to levels considered toxic.
RISKY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals itself published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such consumption and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are blocked by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of the Department of Pharmaceuticals at Milan State University, points out: "Such discoveries are usually immediately notified to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, ensure that the information provided on the product is changed.
That is why you should always read the information on the medicine you are taking, and if something is not understandable, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly," said Ansa.
Paul Krugman wins Nobel Prize in Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics for his analysis of the territorial context of commercial models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most fierce critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his editorial published in the New York Times that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This forecast has provoked a lot of controversy, and it has been thrown into the eyes of the economist on several occasions, but now we know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised and a little shocked at how quickly public interest has moved beyond the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "crushed valuable economist", but at the same time he spreads his criticism of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration in a rather aggressive style.
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package was worth it
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open code application package that increases personal productivity, targeting more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from liberal professions to administration.
After almost a year of work with volunteer developers overseen by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office brings more news to the public: besides the welcome screen and the rethought, less Spartan user interface, it offers more important news. For example, compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operational system, as well as support for the new ISO-standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007, so Open Office can open Microsoft documents with the new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Also interesting are some module specific features, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful when sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a graphics module, while keeping the page-right layout.
On the same interface, we can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with the spreadsheet or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents each other's work from being overwritten. Each employee's comment is marked in a different color, which helps to make it easier to recognize during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of the features of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
On request, we can also take over the installation CD at home or at work.
Free is probably the biggest attraction for the home application, but the Open Office suite is now trying to get in the business sector, as it can expect a number of administrative and school projects.
There is also a lack of ideal education, consultancy and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, spreadsheet manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is the most well-known, Access database manager; and Draw is the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that with the release of the new version we are already at 3,600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's result is positive, this is the fourth doping case
On the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, Bernhard Kohl of Austria, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, once again produced a positive sample, who won the best T-shirt in addition to the bronze medal.
The news was published on the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, after the Italian Riccardo Ricc a and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in the Cera test for the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like tests carried out in recent weeks, was tested by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-malabry.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be banned from racing for two years.
Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, confirmed the positive results of Kohl's third generation EPO test and told the Associated Press that he had indicated the positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, as well as winning the polka dot shirt for the best mountain runner.
REVIEWERS: THE NEW YORK TIMES QUESTION IS ITALIAN RASSIST?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to a popular destination for reluctantly received immigrants.
Is this why "Belpaese" is turning into a racist nation? This is the question asked by the New York Times, which, based on the case of young Burkina Faso's Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the "north paradox": "the strongest integration and the highest employment" in the northern regions, while "anti-immigrantism and the support of the Northern League" are also the strongest in the country.
To support the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes the cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have also been discussed as an example of a change of mood in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic also highlighted this trend: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at Quirinale Palace and suggested that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rents, a room can cost up to 900 euros
The housing market for college students is not affected by the crisis.
According to a recent survey by Sunia, the Union of Tenants, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has reached such an amazing scale that, due to the huge total costs for families, it blocks a wide range of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia's study office. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price increase has started for local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rent restrictions, with a linked lease.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be necessary to maximise prices by revising the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, near Brianza, 450 euros are charged for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (around Bande Nere) to an average of 800 euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can reach 900 euros (around Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room costs about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live near the university, a bed costs EUR 250/280 if it is double and EUR 370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single bed and 450 for a double room bed.
Prices are slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) around the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitta).
In the suburbs, you can save some money: a bed costs 300 euros and a single room costs 450 in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they charge 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room. The price is the highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay EUR 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU often look for accommodation, there is another anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of old movie halls in the cities is over
Traditional cinemas are closing for the benefit of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas, a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore represent effectively everything that happens in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-room cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the atrophy of one-room cinemas in the city centres - seems to be an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When historical and reminiscence-filled places disappear, “it’s like a friend of ours, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences,” says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was an Oscar twenty years ago and the grand prize of the Cannes Festival for Tornatore, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, the yearning for a cinema experience that may have been lost forever.
The data provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, speaks clearly: 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. The biggest loss was recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas have closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront of the most affected regions, which lost 82 one-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And the fact that multiplexes are responsible for their disappearance is no more evident than the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of halls in Lombardy has increased by 195, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It's okay to build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of those already in existence, because when a city cinema closes, not all walkers are willing to go to the multiplexes.
Not to mention unfunded funds to support operators: the state’s overdue debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
To maintain the market, we would need EUR 16-18 million a year".
This is the first Italian city that, in its concern over the closures, decided to remedy the problem through an agreement between the municipality and Anec in order to protect and boost single-room cinemas in the city and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted areas and park at reduced rates in certain parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even with the introduction of other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that ultimately made me do Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale so that I don't see the blacked-out posters, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrest of mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges have been made against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
A handcuff was also placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as a lawyer nephew with the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mafia-like criminal association and was awarded EUR 10 million in compensation.
"Ignoring all legal and moral rules, and even good taste," state prosecutors write. The two local governments have declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to lawyer Piromalli.
"So the clan would have had official access to the town hall, which would have given them further opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not hide that there is "a number of collusion between local institutions and organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean'.
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events of July, when the police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, even because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor at the time of the dissolution, led the right-wing coalition in the second round in 2006.
He shouted a scandal when the County Hall ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He brought the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marco Minnini to justice and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the court explained in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Piromalli clan had ventured to demand a change in project A3.
The wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione, the state prosecutors write, "was willing to meet the demands of an extensive entrepreneur known to represent a group known to be close to the Piromalli family, subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the clan interest."
The energy comes from the waves, and now comes the big ones
It’s an inexhaustible source of energy that makes up 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is only now being discovered by major international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tidal tides, all renewable energy sources that have been eyed by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on it.
For a hundred years, they've been researching how to get energy from sea movements. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but today the demands of environmental protection and the re-increase in oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
According to the 2007 World Energy Council (WEC) in London, 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by marine wave facilities.
This is twice the amount that nuclear power plants currently produce.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are opting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and is considering the possibility of working with us,” a spokesman for the US oil giant’s associate firm, the Wall Street Journal, said in a statement.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a permit for the launch of the Alaskan offshore energy project issued by the US Energy Commission.
This is of no small importance, especially considering that the US is in the process of extracting oil in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the road to extract energy from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as the details are known, show increasing interest.
Technology is waiting to be developed.
Experts say it is still a rudimentary technology, especially because the energy that can be obtained from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as those in Portugal or Scotland, are all small in size and therefore do not pose a major problem for the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, installations need to have a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity goes to land on cables under the sea.
For the time being, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase, which are just waiting for federal permission to use part of the energy produced in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot with the help of six underwater turbines in the East River Strait of New York.
At a tide, the movement of water rotates the turbine blades, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permits to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities that can be exploited through tidal tides.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tidal tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, so they can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the tides, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
