It's not that far.
There's a lot of schools in this town.

That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things: either annihilation, and the dead are unaware of nothing; or, as we are told, a real change: the migration of the soul from this place to another.
Don't hang around.
That's a stupid question.
If you read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you'd stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
Of course.
What are you doing?
I'm putting my passport back in the safe.
Tom felt it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
You don't know anything about that animal.
Take care of yourself.

Get your ass out of here!

Something's not right.
Don't patronize me.

Is humans a part of nature?
You have to be careful.
You know I don't like eggs.
I wish I had a car.
Tomi couldn't help Mari.
Does anyone know Tomi's family name?
I was trying to suppress the crying that came up.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomi I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, your fly's open.
The boy was holding a mouse by his tail.
I want to go there.
I would like to thank you for your great work.
Let's hope not.
Your French language has improved a lot.
Tom won't believe a word you say to him.
Tomi got an "A" on the exam.
Tom's word is against Mari's word.
I don't have time to talk right now.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
They're having coffee at home.
Respect can't be bought.
Tom was smiling.
Tom was terrified.
You should never have left early.
This book is used in Spanish class.
Health is more important than wealth.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think all fat people should diet.
What should we do first?
I don't know, I'll call him and ask him.
Can you suggest another time?
I gave up too soon.
What are you gonna do there?
It's perfectly normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tomi left about 30 minutes ago.
Okay.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted on paying for dinner.
Buy a piece of cake.
I need scissors.
Samuel hadar.
I like to travel alone.
That's not what we want.
My guitar's in the trunk of the car.
We were sitting there.
The glass fell off and broke.
Everyone's scared.
That's a good sentence.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not drowning.
The previous tenants left the place in a mess.
Kiss me.
Your theory is completely out of the question.
Some people look down on other people just because they have less money.
The witch cursed the poor girl.
Tom didn't show much interest.
Your work is done.
I want to pay it now.
I'd like to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Mary solved the mystery.
Do you have any water?
How do I stop Tom?
Tom just got here.
I usually eat with my family at home.
You shouldn't have done that.
We can't prove anything.
You can ski on that hill.
Tom was drunk, so Mary drove him home.
I don't speak English.
Tom's party was a huge success.
Tom was naked.
We saw a castle ahead of us.
Have you ever seen Tom go crazy?
Tomi also seemed surprised.
I often go swimming in the river.
Don't worry about them, they're just a bunch of idiots.
I regret visiting Australia.
They do the same things I did when I was a kid.
That's great.
I fell off the ladder.
Mary went to her fitness class.
The report was prepared in haste, and there were a number of spelling errors.
Tom is neither rich nor famous.
Everyone's lost their minds.
Tom's on the criminal record.
I'm arriving in Boston tomorrow night.
He invited me personally.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm looking for something to eat.
He can't stop it.
I've learned so much about Tom.
I need a job right away.
Everyone's still asleep.
Dog barking.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit down.
I don't know where I am.
Tom's not very well-versed.
He's very proud of his talent.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
All passengers were taken off the plane.
I need a red pen.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
I'm thirsty now.
My dad's taking a bike to work.
Where's Tomi?
Don't be so emotional.
I run eight kilometers a day.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
He's definitely the smartest student in the class.
You should have called the cops.
I'll keep it a secret.
Tom's never flown a broomstick before.
You spilled your coffee.
I couldn't have done better myself.
Tom joined this club three years ago.
My wristwatch is so small, I can't change it.
Go home quickly.

The old book was moldy.
For adults only.

It's important that we help those in trouble.
You can't teach old dogs new tricks anymore.
I need to blow off some steam.
I like the Occitan language.
I see what you mean.
There's work to be done.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Can you lend me the book when you're done with it?
I already told you that.
That would cause a catastrophic accident in the field of work.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what went wrong.
Tom's not afraid to die.
We don't have enough information.
My home is far away.
The bus is on its way.
There is the largest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Either way, you're gonna have to wait your turn...
I don't speak Turkish.
Tom checked his pockets.
The rain got even more intense.
Tom does that to everyone.
Are you logged in?
We're about to change that.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request was denied.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourself.
I'm Antonio.
This is where I met my friend.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like to annoy Tom.
Tomi's our son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tom is upset by the slightest critical remark.
Believe it or not, it's the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like this, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom was just bored.
I don't want to see him.
Help yourself if you want anything to eat.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
We parted with a good feeling.
We haven't had a problem before.
What color is your hair?
In that chair you're sitting in, I was sitting in yesterday.
You're not benevolent.
I hope Tomi understands.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I thought I could trust you.
The noise woke me up.
Compassion is for lame people.
The snow took over the whole town in one night.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't really care.
Autumn is the best holiday season.
Tom's gone?
They called the vet because there were no other doctors in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him swim.
Believe in yourself.
Are you working Monday?
What's your commission?
The dean shook hands with the graduate students.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come anytime.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did your shirt shrink?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom's a Christian?
Ask Thomas to explain.
You broke it.
I slept at the window open because of the heat.
The sun is saved.
He lost his umbrella again.
Let's go to the movies.
I want to fight!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
We studied French instead of German.
Wonderful!
Is that what everyone wants?
Are you breaking up with me?
You can't believe a word he says.
I love Spanish!
I'm going for a walk to clear my head.
A little work won't hurt anyone.
A chain is as strong as his weakest eye.

My father went to Greece.
I've got a pretty bad Berber skills.
The king has destroyed his enemies.
You're talking.
I want Mary to let Tom finish.
I'm exhausted.
We have a big problem.
You're too drunk to drive.
Crying made his eyes red.
You're going there without me.
Tom's gonna starve.
It's no secret.
I was wrong about that.
Have some, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?
He saw Mary Tom smile.
He's in a hurry to catch the 8:00 train.
He was considered a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you, too.
Just give me a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomi has sharp eyesight.
He promised me he'd be here by 4:00.
I don't want to lose this game.
The education system is transforming.
There they are.
Hey.
Tom ate a bowl of blueberries.
I don't feel like getting up.
Thomas thought Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I get goose bumps.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why should we care about what happens after we die?
We have to help each other.
At some point, my dream will come true.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We used to be neighbors.
Do you think I should tell Tom?
What's it worth to you?
Do you know how to do that?
My dad's a doctor.
How old is your old man?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's it made of?
Tom has a scratch on his forehead.
We're cool.
You're smarter than you think.
Have you seen my camera?
Tom's done a lot of great things.
I've been really busy.
There's a limit to everything.
Don't be a smart-ass.
You're gonna pay for this!
It would be nice if we had a collection of the last words of the famous people.
I'm a social worker.
The ceremony was amazing.
I believe your words.
Different?
Tom has as many servants as he needs.
Tom wants to be successful.
Nothing happened.
Were you in the library yesterday afternoon?
I like you more than he does.
He wrote ten books, but he didn't publish any of them.
Tom's at home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat right now.
Tom's happy with his success.
No one got hit.
You can do that for you.
It won't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you take a look at his gallery?
At first I was nervous, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tom first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
He froze somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went that way.
Tom poured milk into his cat's bowl.
I feel like something terrible is going to happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not married.
There's no one there.
We were enemies.
Tom intimidated Mari.
I had no idea you didn't speak French.
I had two dogs.
They're completely different from me.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's sitting down.
Where's the moon when it's not up in the sky?
It's one of the best places in town.
I just need directions.
Tom was supposed to be an actor.
I ignored it.
The dam broke, and water flooded the valley.
You look very pale.
Bring him in.
I'm helping Thomas.
I made a lot of money on the sidelines.
I'm gonna tell Tom what he should tell Mari.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's an accident!
Can I open my eyes now?
Car's blue.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
Tom was born in Boston.
Can you wait a second?
Spiders have eight legs.
I'm just a kid.
Tom despises women.
That's ugly.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That's enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I finally got you.
I'm going to give the message to Tomi.
Mari was too coy to admit her feelings.
Tom should have done a lot better.
Which songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Have you or haven't you?
Mr. Harrison was sitting on his porch in a lugastal zone, in his sleeves, smoking his evening pipe.
I don't feel like studying French today.
Tom's very messy.
Go, but without me.
I was a fool to trust Tom.
What kind of beer do you have?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents aren't alive anymore.
Not everything is black and white.
You have no right to judge these people.
She definitely freaked me out.
Tom and Mary ordered the same thing.
That's what we're discussing.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
Tap water's not healthy.
Can you break an egg with one hand?
Tom has a twin.
He's here to protect you.
Tom seemed very worried.
Tomi's got guts.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
When's the next train leaving?
Sometimes I don't understand him.
Anytime, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
That's not your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
There are two old chestnut trees in front of our house.
They were screaming.
Snowflakes fell on his long blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in this picture.
I hope we don't make you uncomfortable.
Let's discuss this outside.
Thomas is studying chemistry.
He's a man of his word.
I'm not expecting any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass tomorrow's exam.
The sentence is fine.
The new furniture arrived today.
On your horse!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
I'm calling Tom right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully things will be okay.
Paul's clockwork.
She replaced the butter with Margarine.
It was popular in the '90s.
Everyone did.
Are people like goldfish in an aquarium?
I live in a little cabin not too far from here.
Tom risked it.
Excuse me, can I help you?
The paragraph the teacher asked Sarah to read wasn't very interesting.
Tomi and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Mari his number.
He lives across the street from Rod John.
The soup is very hot.
There's no money to sell this for.
Tom would have walked.
Tell Tom to meet us at the station.
He's a professional diver.
It's good to see you again.
Tom was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, some abuse that right.
I just need a little encouragement.
Dani found out Linda passed away.
I'm not the man I used to be.
I'm not Catholic.
Let's rest here.
We're out of money.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand anything.
What's the price of this hat?
I'm from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more space.
Tom taught me the most of what I know in French.
Shall we have a drink?
He keeps his money in a bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard to please everyone.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom makes?
I don't believe it.
This world is ruled by evil forces.
He laughed to hide his fear.
I'm in line right now.
Can I have a kilo of boned tuna, please?
Don't make any noise.
The story was real.
The wounded screamed in pain after the anesthetic wore off.
That's what I need.
How much money do you have?
Focus.
They don't talk at all.
Hold your fire!
He's always asking for your opinion.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I'm very pleased with this purchase.
When two people do the same thing, it's not the same.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
How much money is Tom gonna get?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Serbia borders Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You might as well follow his advice.
My name is Ricardo, and yours?
She's talking in Mary's sleep.
I don't expect this to happen again.
This is for you, Tom.
Get me another beer.
My shoelaces are stuck in the escalator.
What does ice cream taste like?
Thomas speaks French.
I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all safe.
It was a success.
Calm down.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this?
The table is green.
Tom was supposed to win the race.
It has to be me.
I'm not there yet to give up.
I don't want to know either.
Fate often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're racing partners.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're totally nuts.
He had a cold, so he didn't come to school today.
Something's not right.
They're going to negotiate tomorrow.
This table has a smooth surface.
Open up!
Do you understand English?
He got up early to see the sunrise.
Tom took part in a webinarium.
Do I detect sarcasm?
It's hard to steal a thief.
Tom's never gonna lose his temper.
Tell me, where are the police?
She was so tired, she fell asleep.
I hope to start learning your beautiful language in the near future.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need tools.
I'll count to three.
Don't talk to me.
Tomi didn't even know how to thank me in French.
Where's the nearest pharmacy?
I was singing.
Tom and Mari are as different as fire and water.
Tomi's a good performer.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were hippies.
This is a mistake.
This car looks like mine.
You're such an idiot.
It may be obvious to you, but not to me.
Don't try to imitate me.
No one can know everything.
He's a bus driver.
Don't eat.
But that's not the real problem.
What's the title of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are you telling us the truth?
Russia's big.
Who's the woman standing there?
Tom called it a bust.
Tom was the most powerful man in town.
I can't wait to get married.
Is it cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
You've got to go crazy.
Don't ask me to help you anymore.
I'm not coming.
I thanked you.
Let's get a pine tree.
This isn't drinking water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
Please say it louder.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tomi has a black cat.
Courage gives birth to heroes, and trust gives birth to friendships.
Again, he came up with the old story.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolates.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light went out, and we stayed in the dark.
I'm planning on cleaning my room.
The horse stopped and refused to go any further.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I've decided to join the volunteer fire department.
Tom got up, but then he sat down again.
I like melons.
I'd rather not go out today.
The woman sitting there is his current wife.
I've got the letter.
I feel so much better today.
The train arrived on time.
You can't do anything wrong by learning a language.
Shut up or I'll have you thrown out!
Is everything ready?
I have to go.
I'm not yelling.
There's nothing to justify their existence.
Mathematicians are poets, they just have to prove what their imaginations created.
I'm cooperating.
He was most afraid of the mess.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good morning, sweetheart.
What do you think of modern art?
My name's not Tom.
The heat is terrible today.
George is the most diligent boy in our class.
Tom's in his tent, isn't he?
Rome wasn't built in a day.
How old were you when you started learning French?
What happened to the money?
We must protect ourselves from any attempt to take away our freedom.
Seventy-five divided by five is fifteen.
What did you do last night?
Let's get a doughnut.
Tom's intentions weren't clear.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he wanted.
I can see the light.
I'm only as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't talk to me like that.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
He's a vegetable salesman.
You can't win all the time.
It's a silver coin.
I feel helpless.
Goodbye.
I'm getting fat.
It's ten o'clock already.
The road is full of potholes.
What do the papers say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If time allows, let's go on a picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Whose rings are these?
I'm convinced I'll win this tennis match.
They went to Boston.
One of us is wrong.
I was surprised by what I learned.
Elephants have two ears.
We're boys.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Can you make me a copy of this?
I need to give you a message.
He said he didn't know.
It's worse than we thought.
You know my secret.
He covered up his tattoos.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
He told the boys to line up.
They have 12 kids.
My hobby is reading novels.
You'll get used to it quickly.
I don't know why Tomi went to the hospital.
Prices are down.
I don't mind waiting.
We helped each other.
This happened when he was out.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'm hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's go over it.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes contradicted each other.
I planted this tree.
Tom let me go.
May I have your full name?
Boring!
I don't care what he says.
I told you this wouldn't work!
Tom gave Mary chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding pass.
I saw one.
What do you do for a living?
Tom is Mary's boss.
Small or no chance of finding the real conspirators at all.
They let Tom down.
Too bad I'm late.
Tom didn't agree with Mari.
I want to make you smile.
Is that a bird?
I've had enough of Tom and Mary.
Is that a wolf?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I'm having a bad day.
All right, everybody, let's go.
Tom went on a trip with his friends.
I heard Tomi and Mari were getting married in October.
The white ball is as heavy as the red ball.
I need you here.
Can you drive there?
I don't think this chair is comfortable.
Tomi poured hot water on his tea.
Tom was trying to lower his costs.
Tom told the dog to sit down.
Tomi's never coming back, is he?
You know me.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
Tomi might need it.
To me, he's like a king.
He looks young.
I'm from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good for animals.
I didn't register.
The salt you put in the soup is white, not pink.
I'm always looking out for you.
Tom started cleaning up.
I take the train to work every day.
You seem nervous.
We need to get started now.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm scared of Tomi.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Then the bear ran up to the wheelbarrow, threw off its bear skin and touched it with the magic wand the witch gave him. In a moment, the skin turned into a beautiful, moonlit prom dress, and the wheelbarrow turned into a carriage, drawn by two dancing steeds.
Don't make a mistake.
Are you busy right now?
He's giving his time to books.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tomi.
I heard you're not going home either.
I'm sick and tired of your complaints.
Young people today are smart.
Police found a body in an abandoned car near the park.
I'm sure you can do it.
The sun is at the heart of our solar system.
Fatal?

The next train will arrive on track 2 and depart for Shibuya at 4:35.
Did you do it?
What are they doing there?
Would you like a cup of tea?
Do you have any more of this?
I can't find my other glove.
Tom's partial.
Nurses look after the patient day and night.
People don't think it's weird anymore when a man grows his hair long.
A boy grabbed my wallet when he ran past me on his bike.
Who do you trust?
Here's my e-mail address.

I know if he's an enemy or not.
Is there anything I can do for you?
The whole town knows.
Someone pushed me in.
Mary's not that pretty.
That book cover had some ink stains on it.
He wanted to go out.
Tom lacks flexibility.
I'm going to Australia next year.
Are you Japanese?
He was a poor musician.
The animals are our friends.
I don't like surprises like that.
He was a cruel man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw him with my own eyes and I heard him with my own ears.
Would you excuse us for one second, please?
Which one's your beer?
I won't allow them to use my Husqvarna chainsaw.
Everything in the bathroom was tiled right up to the ceiling.
I'll read the description to get it working.
The area was completely quiet.
Skiing.
Tom has no idea what's real.
Hey, listen to me!
Do you live with your parents?
I'm not that naive.
I had him open the door.
I know you don't like funerals.
Do you have enough time?
Spanish used to be the official language of the Philippines.
Emily's home.
My son makes more money than I do.
We've become bronzers.
I'm old-fashioned.

I'll have a Coke.
Bearded.

There's a lot of boys running in the park.
I could have done better.
We all agreed.
I've never had a clam before.
My car keeps shutting down.
Needless to say, Tom was late.
I can't find it.
It needs fixing.
Have you had enough of the day robot?
He's got half as many books as I do.
We're extremely busy.
Boris asked me to give you this.
We're all crazy.
Tom can understand why Mari feels depressed.
There's someone at the door.
Tom denied any involvement in this case.

What are you looking at?
It's unlikely Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.

It's dangerous here.
I can't stand that noise.
It's really nice to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.

What would you do if you had a child like that?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.

Your soul is doomed to hell.
I have a fever and a headache.
I'm getting ready.
Put this out.
He's won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is a waste of time.
Come on, touch it.
Tom asked Mary the same thing he asked me.
The moon belongs to no one.
We were born into this world for a reason.
I helped Tomi decorate his Christmas tree.
I forgot to buy Eve flowers.
We didn't do it for Tomi.
He could've kissed me goodbye, but he didn't, he just walked away.

I have doubts if it will work.
Let's do the dishes.
He's not into sports, and neither am I.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What am I supposed to do with Tomi?
I feel better every single day.
I feel feverish.

Please help me.
He didn't say anything.
What are you apologizing for?
Tom's afraid he'll be deceived.
Did you know Tom left home?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
There was no one in the room.

Give me back my book.
Although we have done everything we can, we know that we will not win.
It was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.

It'll be our secret.
Why are you so anxious?
I'm sorry, but I didn't quite understand what you said.
There was a fire near us last night.
We'd better get going, Tom.
You all probably need some sleep.
I'm pretty sure Tom's not gonna eat this.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
I got on the plane.
Are you home?
Clouds surround the mountain.
That's my problem.
How can I make you understand?
It's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I assume Thomas was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Thomas to help.
Tom's out there.

Get a haircut.
Thomas only drinks bottled water.
Personally, I find blow jobs more enjoyable than regular sex.
That's incredible.
After a short wait, he started saying stupid things.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
It's a crime.
Tom's gonna cook.
Do you have an e-mail address?
You're in a hurry, but you're not ready.
The Tomi knew where Mary put her car.
You should be asleep by now.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.

Sometimes I go to the movies.
Thomas never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not throwing Tom out.
Tom pulled a $20 bill out of his pocket.
I didn't want to tell you this.
I'm not going to Boston either.

It's up to you whether we go there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I've made up my mind.
You shouldn't be waiting too long.
Tom seems to be enjoying the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying!
Tom packed the boxes against each other by the wall.
It's well known that a bear likes honey.
We were winning.

I'm fine.

Why don't we go out to dinner tonight?

Can I ask you a question?
Guess what I found.
I'm seasick.
There were giant snails in Florida.
Tom's too young for that, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't get the wedding ring off my finger.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
He was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do you speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep watching.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.

Attention, please.
I'm ready to help you anytime.
We're gonna figure this out.
The batteries are dead.
You found me a good seat.
Sooner or later, we're all gonna die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you ever smoked?
Tom applied for the job.
He couldn't hide Tom's disappointment.
We tried to warn you.
I found that their volaps were very complicated, unlike Esperanto, which is very simple.

Who brought this?
There's glass shards all over the floor.
These bananas aren't ripe.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
But I don't have any money.
I think you were right.
Where was the wedding held?
I'm swimming in the river.
