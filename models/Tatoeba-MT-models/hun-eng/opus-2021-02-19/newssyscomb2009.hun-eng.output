Victory of right-wing populists in Austria, 29 percent in total
The first preliminary results of the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday resulted in a noticeable weakening of the two parties of the so-called Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖRP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position was seriously shaken, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) and the provincial magistrate of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, are preparing to return to national politics.
Based on preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and in particular, the result is literally disastrous for the People's Party that has brought about early elections.
At the beginning of July, when leaving the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage for SPÖ, according to public opinion polls.
But the voters apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
The first reactions to the results were speculation about the possible resignation of the party president Wilhelm Molterer and the current vice chancellor.
The observers believe that this could already take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Party Presidency.
This development would probably facilitate an increasingly likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) had previously acquired 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ had 11 percent of the votes - but the Social Democrats also expressed fear of the repetition of 1999 when the People's Party agreed on joint governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still united at the time, leaving the BZÖ in 2005), which even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously expecting this solution.
The Green Party has also reached Parliament, which has slightly lost its popularity, and has fallen from third to fifth among Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four-percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations in India can get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal bug collection could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be some confusion in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister published this in New York after meeting Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner, today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, a certain estrangement would occur," he said after the meeting, which was inspired by the Czech Republic.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in court matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership in Darjeeling, under whose jurisdiction the case falls.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
However, for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji believes that it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then you could apply for bail on bail and wait for the verdict, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in a similar way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to a higher court, it would be possible to acquit him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide "competent legal support" to the prisoner, mentioned the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party had already provided them with such assistance.
"Our main interest in India is to preserve the best relationships with many years of tradition.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"In fact, it is a grave mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The question as to whether the Indian party had been promised to deal with the case was avoided by the Minister.
"I've already received relatively many promises," he said.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It moves to the wall electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Luigi Santosuosso, an Italian lawyer who is part of a team of 30 members of the UN's Ocean and Law of the Sea.
His boss, Michulka Václav, Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation that he sometimes complements.
There is a boost and enthusiasm here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, a world that is hardly known to date.
Oil, ores and other minerals can be found here, but still unknown living organisms, which may be the key to developing cancer medicine.
Seabeds larger than land
Coastal states are now intensively applying for new submarine areas.
According to the UN Convention, they assert their rights, which was agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental pedestal, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometres off the coast of that country.
According to the Convention, such a country has exclusive rights to all sources of continental pedestal.
"Simplified, we keep that part of the continental pedestal and the bottom layer of the seabed, which is the natural continuation of the subterranean continent.
At the borders of the coastal sea, often two hundred nautical miles extend beyond the limits of an economic zone only," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by that country to the Commission on the external borders of the Continental shelf should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
To date, the Committee has discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far only the last three mentioned countries have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia has recently been echoed in the world, which was the first to significantly expand its subsea country.
But New Zealand has also won - the seabed area awarded to it by the Committee is approximately 1.6 million square kilometers, that is six times larger than the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from future use of the seabed are hoped to be invaluable.
Other countries also keep submitting applications.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental pedestal ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity" begins.
No country is in its exclusive position here anymore.
The right to extract in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually defined".
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed is now owned by the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organization.
This organisation received the so-called "piercing investor" status under the Convention in 1991, like investors in some other countries.
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it's a sort of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"A total of 75,000 square kilometers can be extracted.
The area is rich in polymetalic ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian in Division, presents another example of a concretion.
It reminds me of a potato or a little fantasy of parchment with the magic words that bring Golem to life.
German special forces were involved in the rescue of hostages.
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, special forces were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the release of the eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are coming to light.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to this, in addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, the staff of the GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force, the Federal Crime Office and the logistics experts of the German Technical Service were also at the scene of the rescue.
According to the Ministry spokespersons on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed, since the hostage takers allowed their prisoners to run and fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
"Thankfully, this did not happen," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs.
On 19 September, the attackers abducted a group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt.
Following the kidnapping in the South Egyptian desert area, the hostages were carried back and forth across the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has remained unclear so far, as has the details of the rescue of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier told me that the hostages released were under German embassy protection.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
For the time being, no information has been provided in Berlin as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily newspaper, the five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force Airbus plane.
The U.S. House rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress has, by a small majority, failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite the calls made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme was not given a majority in order to contain the chaos that prevailed on the financial markets.
The supporters desperately attempted to convince critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, a negotiator from the Democratic Party, called on the Members to support him, even if the plan is unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political support to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
The Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index increased shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after failure was made public.
Experts expect additional severe turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House and the Senate.
Directors register more and more reservations.
Good winter for German tour operators.
According to one study, the turnover of the next few months' travel reservations increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical prospects, the Germans' sense of travel was not reduced according to the study.
For winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in traffic compared to the previous year, said the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of reservations of the autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was approximately 11 percent higher than in October 2007, said DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account travel booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travels to the USA were particularly sought-after, said DRV.
Here, the rate of reservations has increased by a third.
The German destinations are also particularly popular with Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic landscapes.
Mostly organized roads, said Klaus Laepple, president of DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the cost of organised trips is "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised journeys."
Among other things, passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, he added.
The booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so traffic growth can be booked again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, less German tourists took a trip than the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Unceasingly repetitive ballermann hits, liter jar beers and design conductors.
It's a debut on Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I aren't really that much alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she's wearing a custom-made conductor.
My hair's dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the thrift store.
However, one thing connects us: We've only been on Wiesn for three minutes, we're already being rushed by photographers and filled with their memory cards - I'm very flattered, and all this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap conductor's doing his job.
As a Wiesn tourist located north of the white sausage equator, my sense of comfort is still limited by folk costumes.
But when you arrive at Theresienwieses, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone is wearing a dresser or leather pants; nobody is looking back or embarrassed - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are just my Dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich draws my attention to the fact that I made the apron wrong: "You're free on the left, virgin in the middle, sold right, widow in the back."
I secretly tied the bow to the back left.
"That's good," he says, and he laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirty techniques and wear simple felt-up hats with the words "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and show their naked butts unsolicitedly.
The young man with exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, prolonging the "aaaaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after he gets rid of the contents of his previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants everyone sees as garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the infamous "no-hitters."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics will march through the scene and take care of the poor people.
The nurses always show up on a team - four at a time carrying a covered gurney from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure stuffed.
You can't tell who's lying in the tarp under the tarp.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," shouts one of the medics to my question, and then in the shoot.
Police have identified the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
With Brentwood resident, Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, the accident took place Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
Since then, he's been released on bail.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey's intention to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neorenaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building surrounds the end of the platforms with a tower at each of the front corners, and it looks like some German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little rocky.
However, in view of the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is obvious what a large enterprise this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the "later future" of conquests, intended to achieve the ambitions of the Middle East through this railway leading from Damascus through Baghdad to Saudi Arabia today.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and expelled the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station didn't do any better.
In 1917 an munitions train exploded and destroyed the nicely designed roof of the building.
According to the Turkish sources, there's been an act of sabotage.
Since then, it's been slowly ruined, and history has gone far beyond.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the entire Eastern region, it serves as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey, at least in a symbolic sense.
The Justice and Development Party on the government - the AKP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of zötszöszön, which at the time gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended as a symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the past atom.
However, the AKP, known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building made of stone and steel, specially designed for this purpose - standing in a developing suburb between semi-finished shopping centres and cafés. In the latter, the middle managers in suits meet - both men and women - to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have fit a right-to-centre politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to assist Turkey's reintegration into its immediate environment.
The Cold War upset the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
Today he had to turn east and west at the same time.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both ways.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you'll be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to come to a crossroads."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here almost mechanically repeated: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea benefit Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
It is as if they want to convey the message that, figuratively, the whole of Europe, together with Turkey, will be able to reach Asia and the Middle East on those east railways.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another largely awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the recovery of this fancy structure 100 years ago.
How they would have wondered to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was once called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time, there was no question of which continent to claim this exciting country.
Memorable Paths: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (Necrolog, Sept. 11) has been the musical director of Guildford and led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the part of the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus the following year.
In principle, only people under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape changer) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music they put in front of it - whether it's a madrigal or a Messiaen piece; without accompaniment or orchestral accompaniment.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration for music our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the sheet music.
So sing it."
His craftsmanship was always completely understandable and accurate, but it was never dictatorial or exaggerating.
Whatever the level of music was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there was ever a conductor who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 or so years, I've been criticizing more than 100 concerts, but I've never been disappointed by one, and I've often been thrilled with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated arm leaders who, in his words, simply "galloped with a few well-known battlehorses all over the world."
A lot of us are gonna miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary William Woodruff (September 25th), "in 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship student at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while constantly preparing for his basic degree, master's degree and PhD."
It's from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End," but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and while under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry".
In 1950-51, he was actually in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and moved to Illinois.
There's no telling why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino in the Faculty of Humanities
I recommend J. Vicente Resino's "Flamenco and Life. " Because his black-and-white documentary-style photos are impressive.
I was drawn to my attention by the simplicity and strength that flowed from them, as well as by respect for the people in the photographs.
This exhibition is filled with emotion.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second sales record at Honda
In November Honda will start marketing second generation Jazz.
It is true that the passenger space of his predecessor was large enough, but the design of the interior of the new model is even more spacious.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the sight of the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor, many internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move on to the detailed presentation of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was put on the market.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda managed to renew this model in a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, it has set sales records in other markets.
For example, such a market was Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and then again in 2008.
In Japan, for example, nearly a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since it entered the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, selling nearly half a million examples in six years.
However, Honda wants to continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83.000 Jazz, by 2009 estimates were set to sell 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz pieces on the Spanish market, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total turnover in Spain.
For the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate the example sold over a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda's turnover in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4,000 less than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the sales conditions, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact hybrid - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 units a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese producer, the US would account for 50% of the market share of Insight, while the remaining share would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the formal Valencia demonstration scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
It has a length of 3900 mm (five inches longer), a width of 1690 mm (two inches wider) and a distance of five inches, i.e. 2500 mm.
On the other hand, its height remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the cabin became more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body and the fuel tank in the middle - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double floor trunk has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes that these dimensions refer to the type with 1.4 engine, because the 1.2 Honda Jazz boot is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be found, such as rear LED lamps or optional panoramic glass roofs, and easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the rear-seat doors was raised to 80 degrees, opposite the opening angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation jazz engines are new.
At the start of its distribution, this small model can be ordered with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre engines.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while the engine delivers outstanding performance in all respects.
The power of the 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at a speed of 6000 and its maximum torque is 114 Nm at a turn of 4900.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and produces 125 grams of CO2.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The crash avoider is a beehive.
For the development of anti-accident technologies, Nissan this time was inspired by nature, precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents by imitating the fly of bees.
The Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center, in cooperation with the renowned Tokyo University's Advanced Research and Technology Research Centre, built this small robot in Japan.
Kazuhiro Doi, Director of the Technology PR and Research and Development Brand, defined BR23C as a further extension of Nissan's four-level safety cover.
The robot enhances the ability of the company's products to avoid collision.
During flight, each bee develops its oval - shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety envelope.
However, the role of the complex eye of the uterus is much more important, with which it can see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in each direction. Consequently, the uterus can fly smoothly in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the composite eye, engineers designed a so-called Laser Range Finder.
The instrument shall identify the obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before the BR23C, calculate their distance, and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which shall immediately be converted into an action to avoid collision.
"As soon as the barrier is detected, the small robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at smaller or larger angles to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the instruments currently available is that in this case the avoidance manoeuvre is carried out completely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
In a way other than bees, the manoeuvring manoeuvre shall not be directed upwards or downwards, nor diagonally, but only in two dimensions, and only in the direction of wheel rotation, i.e. not in infinite directions and ways, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, Nissan also used a rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration in the robot to avoid collisions.
"This device only has to process and react to the data every few seconds.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memories.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step towards the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, can enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional option to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of Mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, apart from having a lot of investmentable cash, is not without common sense.
Because of the crisis and the need for Americans not to get caught up in the mazes of unquestionable mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
It's the hotel for bad loans... that's for trouble.
The view of the hotel and the receptionist in particular suggests that we should consider once more, twice, even three times, if it is actually the time to take out the loan.
And especially where to apply for a loan, since that's probably what this is about.
The information on the website is really useful, but in little detail.
It's more for teenagers than for the public.
But what would happen if we added to the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in our dream room.
Actually, that's something, 'cause we can't even dream of buying a place.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it will provide a share in its capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay USD 9 billion for 21% of the company’s capital, after Morgan Stanley’s stock price has fallen heavily on the stock market.
One week after the prior agreement was published, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, that is, a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price falls by more than 19% from the book value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and an exchange rate of 31.25 dollars.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on an average exchange rate of $29 which is 28% higher than the current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price dropped by 6.79% in the middle of 17 o'clock in greenwich, closing at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up its transformation into a banking company," explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the corporate giants listed on Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that 20% of its shares would be sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought that the stake would be entirely ordinary shares," explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and prevent potential risks."
With regard to the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share will be reduced by about 20%.
According to the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares after one year, if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. to around $47.
Morgan Stanley will thus ensure that it can use funds from MUFG to leverage its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not want to give precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the merger of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its Tier I solvency rate by about 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has said that its balance has improved "definitely" since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as its stock price has dropped by half, while the cost of providing insurance against non-payment risks has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
One of the major investment banks remained "survivors" following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he had earned $15 billion: part of this came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
Rebuilding the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan for Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Rafael Correa of Ecuador.
Following the model of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa presented his ideas on the new constitution on Sunday.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the votes were unfilled.
The adoption of the draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the exit of the polling offices and a census carried out by a civil society have both proved the huge superiority of the "yes" votes with a ratio of 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, talked about the victory of his draft constitution on the night from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, and he thanked the Ecuadorians at the governor's seat in Guayaquil, which is 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales and Chilean president Michelle Bachelet.
According to a report from the observation mission of the Organization of the United States of America (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed constitution places state power at the service of the economy, while maintaining the right to "plan development" for a country which essentially lives from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currencies sent by immigrants.
The draft constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain seats for up to two consecutive periods and is entitled to disband the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she intends to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009 for the Head of State mandate.
In addition, the Constitution included the freeness of health services and education.The President has already started to introduce it in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives below the living standards.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to Quito and Washington's agreement to use the Ecuadorian facility as a basis for US drug control measures.
They freed 19 hostages in Chad.
Egyptian commando ambushed the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and eight escorts ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held for ten days in the desert, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad by an Egyptian commando this morning.
Apparently, in good condition, they arrived by plane at Al Maza military base around 2:30 p.m., which is directly related to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were forbidden to make a statement to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo’s suburbs, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers were "no ransom" - said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were captured on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they took part in an off-road safari.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and director of the Aegyptous travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security chief, a 30-member special task force arrived on two helicopters at the scene where the hostage takers were ambushed just before dawn.
"There was a firefight among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the leader asking for his name to be withheld.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must acknowledge that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and our task forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied paying a ransom for the hostages.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that during patrol they had intercepted an SUV on which the kidnappers were traveling, killing six of them (including the Chadian leader) and arresting two of them.
According to the military, the hostage takers were associated with a Darfur rebel organization called the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "silent majority" of culture
The news and the ongoing election campaign are currently focused on the debate on the financing of culture.
We should be happy about that.
But a piece of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will speak out to highlight the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national historical sites on the verge of starvation?
What politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings forming part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government spent three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
And the constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Quebec Association of Historical Societys (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec), 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy are working on the research of history and the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds, with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and nails, and with the last strength of the drowning they protest when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Benelux Governments Nationalize Part of Fortis Bank
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux States are helping, as the first European, the Belgian-Dutch bank in distress due to the spillover effect of the US credit market crisis, Fortison: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution, which also has interests in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed at the highest level on the matter at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
In the euro area, Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the context of an international financial market crisis that has been raging in the waves for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered to be a precedent in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, almost half of all three states (49 percent) acquire the bank's existing property there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from ABN Amro in the Netherlands last year, mainly insurance companies.
Fortis' shares started falling steeply last week, and in the second half of the week there were serious crises at the Institute.
However, analysts agree that with 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's paperwork fell to a 14-year-old low of about 12 percent on Friday alone.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the corporate directors this is not realistic.
The management, by the way, blamed the overseas market uncertainty about the adoption of the $700 billion U.S. package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers went up slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, a new CEO was appointed to head the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has come forward with a substantial offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose money.
So far, there's been no panic among the bank's clients, the accounts haven't been rushed.
In Hungary Fortis has a stand-alone account and purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant, based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection program that always requires the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
This must be in independent hands, otherwise the fox will be entrusted to the henhouse," quotes Richard Dick, the developer of the program for tracking prescriptions, the Washington Post.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of an accident dependent on the health status of the applicant and shall not make insurance with it if they consider the risk to be too high.
They used to send him for medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: from pharmacies, based on the customer's identification number, he easily acquires what drugs he has purchased in the last year and a half, and the program itself concludes what disease he is suffering from and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol, it suggests that you have virtually uncontrolled levels of fat in your blood, which immediately places you in a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some of them also set a risk multiplier, so the insurance company has little to do but paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages are that some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, for example, some substances can be used against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-raising factor for business insurers and not the former.
To obtain and process the data, separate companies were formed, and before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies, they asked the patient for his consent.
They are now bound by the authorities, although no penalty has been imposed for their failure to do so.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the use control will be increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate health data protection law, but its scope applies only to healthcare providers and insurers.
Before the convention, there is a bill that gives authorities control over companies specialising in providing information.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough: he has therefore improved his programme, which would be linked to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned may hardly refuse to consent, otherwise the insurers will not sign a contract with him.
So the hens are somehow dependent on the fox's favor.
Global Marseille Menu
Doubles trade between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India are leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit has been dominated by this topic, alongside the other major global problems.
Today there will be a French-Indian summit, where we will focus mainly on nuclear cooperation.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given greater say in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to reach a common ground to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This issue was thus not asked at the summit held yesterday in Marseille and now at the ninth summit.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was also agreed to double in five years, thus increasing trade turnover to EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade in goods between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, i.e. air traffic may also soar in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy said they'd speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi, it is only ninth in the EU's list of partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, have been condemned on both sides in all its forms and called for a UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the completion of the Doha trade round, although both of them have a large share in the failure they have had so far.
The EU has confirmed that it is insisting on its energy and climate programme, i.e. that it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed with this, as well as with the need to negotiate a global deal at the next climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to hinder the rise in food prices and support the call for an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where he intends to make a deal at the bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they hope that French companies will be commissioned to build Indian nuclear reactors worth EUR 20 billion.
According to intelligence from the news agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishing houses will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse fair.
For this year's Frankfurt International Book Fair, 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries are expected in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403.000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Javak and Activities: Italy will occupy a 264 square metre exhibition area by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference in the "Room Struktur" room of Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where there will also be an opportunity to present information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in adult and youth publications.
They found the plane of the missing billionaire Steve Fossett a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3rd, 2007.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau near Mammoth Lakes, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, dispelled all remaining doubts: "After determining the location of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's the plane that Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that there were no human remains found in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transport Safety (NTSB) stated that a commission of inquiry was requested a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which was able to identify the plane and determine that it really was the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett from Yerington, Nevada, took a three-hour flight.
Yesterday in California, near the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal effects near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two Fosset IDs issued by the Illinois FAA, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has set up a number of peaks that he used to write himself into history.
In 2002, on the sixth try, he first managed to fly around the world with a balloon: two weeks of solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the earth without landing.
He has several records of flying above the Andes at a height of 15,445 metres, carried out by a copilot.
GLK, it's a shocking commercial.
It is an unusual but also original and distinct formist hobbit with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is Mercedes-Benz's latest compact SUV, with which the German car company tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
This is precisely the reason why the introduction campaign of SUV GLK, which is available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual.
Indeed, the advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is using a media communication tool that has so far been unknown, including utopian 3D posters that have never been used by a car brand in Italy.
The giant poster operation, which consists of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the spatial presentation of the car, where special glasses distributed around the new SUV, Corso Como, will be visible in almost real size and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel like the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, so that it can then form a unified picture.
There is no doubt that Mercedes, with this promotion, is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical advertising world of the automotive industry.
Is this going to be a good way to attract future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are
They're young people from Trivenet.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? Members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the national team for years, and which, in truth, has not been too much trouble so far.
They've never been in a fight with the opponents.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main organizers are from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
They waved Italian flags, featuring the home town of the fans: they were taken off on Saturday so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team called Levski's fans.
The Italian football association made 144 tickets available to Italian fans, which were registered tickets, making it easier to control the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior also checked everyone: among those preparing for Sofia, there was no one to be prosecuted, no one to be banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a football-related record have been denied a ticket and a trip.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for reports from the Sofia Police and then takes the necessary measures: fans arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban on visiting not only Italian but all the stadiums in Europe.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
Fortunately.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, that is, that of this little 150, others will join.
"We must immediately suppress this fire, we must not excuse anyone who behaves like this," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So we better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's National Match Day is coming up in Lecca.
In Puglia there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
The Observatory will meet tomorrow, and the Committee on the Safety of Sports Events will meet Tuesday, which will also count on a section of the Home Security Service, the secret services on cheerleading behaviour.
"Duce-Duce's chanting and swinging arm under the Italian anthem is not a crime in Bulgaria..."
This idea was expressed, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago as head of the Ministry of Interior's monitoring service (received by Francesco Tagliente and previously by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been chief of police for Trieste, the city where there has been a cell that has supported the Ultras Italy group since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims to be true is that the Duce is not forbidden in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, added the first man in the surveillance service, but crimes have to be judged in the country where they were committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's also talk a little bit about the whistling of the Italian anthem: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, it's not good manners either..."
