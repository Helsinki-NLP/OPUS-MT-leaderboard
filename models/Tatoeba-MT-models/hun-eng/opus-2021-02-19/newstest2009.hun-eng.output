The Prague stock market went down at the end of the trade
The Prague stock market corrected his losses after the rapid fall this morning.
Transactions in shares in the Czech Energy Enterprise (ČEZ) amounted to nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague stock market continued its fall on Monday from the beginning of Tuesday when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street's shares is behind the decline.
This is how the market's reaction to the vote of the US House of Representatives is manifested, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Shares falling in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although some of the losses were finally cancelled during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange Index described almost four percent during trading, but later it deleted some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 3.8 percent on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The stock market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but in the end, losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market is down 3.6 percent according to the index there.
"The timing of the American rescue mission is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Finance Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its financial policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should resume negotiations immediately and accept the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House rejected the draft funding for the financial system, to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner) should have been spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares experienced a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
The Dow Jones dropped by almost seven percent, and the last time she experienced a similar fall was 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House of Representatives, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdrew: the US government could pump $700 billion into the banks
The major leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance for the American financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
American legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner).
But there's no victory yet.
Congress must complete some of the provisions of the agreement before they can make public the final form and vote of the law.
The draft funding for the financial system will be discussed in the House on Monday.
He informed Reuters news agency on Sunday, Barney Frank, president of the Financial Organizations Committee.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
According to economists, there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revitalisation of the financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "easing" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our disparate views on what the form of the market stabilisation package should be like," said the Bloomberg agency, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
He said that the final vote could take place on Sunday.
The legislator's representatives met Henry Paulson, the American Finance Minister, on Saturday night to give government funds a permanent form.
This should buy from financial companies the unsellable mortgages that will put financial firms in serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to a final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The reform plan still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
A Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the legislators are therefore striving to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
In fact, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress's decision could be the first to influence Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the U.S. Congress will vote on the law, nor will it be clear whether the trial should not be interrupted at the last minute due to a problem.
Legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President George Bush, the first 350 billion dollars should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issuance of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional USD 100 billion and then USD 350 billion, if it feels that the programme is not fulfilling its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of the securities of the bad mortgage that lost their value, was maintained because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesperson, stated that the president was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated the "bipartisan efforts made to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of compulsory severance payments
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts, and the timing of the financing plan.
The new law also limits the so-called busy severance payments of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a supervisory committee for the Fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also takes into account the assistance provided to homeowners who have problems paying back.
The government should negotiate new instalments for the mortgages it purchases, with a view to reducing the monthly instalments of debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual Aid
The proposed draft is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement, according to David Marek, the leading economist at Patria Finance.
"This is because it is not possible to know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute losses among themselves," said iHNed.cz this week to Marek.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is much more important for Congress to decide this week to support the plan and to give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
Couple fight at blade edge: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost all mobile phones are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
This makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons to purchase an MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end high-end record player at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on vinyl records, but there is no objective reason for this in qualitative terms.
However, if his shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl plates, he probably dreams of such a record player.
This is similar to travel, or compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to release 8,000 kroner for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a 20-kron market earphone.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide selection.
The Lifetime of the Elements also counts
Some high-end music players can do much more than simply play music, but also what most mobiles can't possibly do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and text messages, you can also play music and video, record both, have a better, worse camera, and even navigate.
And considering the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a miracle, since no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph.
A multifunctional mobile has its drawbacks.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
Music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful in this regard.
With cheap cell phones, count on them not to play for you for more than a few hours.
If you're even on the phone here and there, get another charger at your workplace just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
The MP3 players will not have such problems, even the worse can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a upload.
The next problem arises when uploading music to mobile phones.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connection and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without an adapter with miniature memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players with some exceptions (iPod) you do not need any special software.
Enough to upload the device from the computer with music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players already create their own music directories, based on the name of the album, the name of the genre, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only represent a tree structure like Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles know more
When choosing the specific equipment, please ask about the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output, and of course also about the comfort of the treatment.
If music is primarily a background to you and you listen to it only briefly every day, for example, on the tram, any MP3 cell phone will suit you.
And any cell phone can actually do that.
You don't have to pay much attention to what musical formats the mobile or player can do.
The MP3 will cope with each and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
The MP3 is one of the most popular and the vast majority of devices also cope with WMA-format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less frequent.
Better mobiles also allow you to buy music on-line, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service in itself can be a strong argument for obtaining a music mobile.
Unfortunately, service providers are lousy and usually limited to one summer radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that such a way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, your cell phone is in your pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether he always carries the headphones or at least the speakerphones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost all mobiles have, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, music cell phones will probably have the biggest advantage of price.
The cheapest usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand kroner, you can get quite a decent walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to 15 thousand kroner with conventional 3.5 mm hole.
On the other hand, the advantage of players is simple handling.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) can really be tackled by everyone.
Minimal function, handling similar to a previous tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of a collapse in the form of an inadvertently switched-on mobile internet or in the subsequent huge account for data transmission.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have an opening to replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can buy up to 2,000 kroner.
Be careful, though.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do anything with up to 8GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you belong to more demanding students, choose special mobilewalkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson is the farthest in the sector, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price category up to 4,000 kroner, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual service provider that imposes a substantial price reduction on classic service providers.
Maybe it won't be for much longer.
On the Mobil.cz website we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than in other EU countries.
After the European Commission's latest step to regulate roaming charges, this may lead to a controversial situation - text messages sent from abroad to some Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than domestics.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound controversial, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has often said that there is no room for new service providers in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the classical service provider with its own network may not have much chance (although it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is another option - the virtual service provider.
It was the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought about significant price reductions, after which classical service providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, there were voices like ours in Britain.
However, it has been demonstrated that such providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the start of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
In less than six months, this service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which is also the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to operate efficiently, you need much less customers than the traditional service provider.
There is no relatively high cost of building, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world thus generally appear at low cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, which are often counterbalanced by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages at least 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like, whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to say whether a vision like the one in Poland could work for us.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach, on which most virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it has been relatively satisfactory in terms of the supply of services."
Not a chance in the Czech Republic, claims mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobileking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem very hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Finance Group in her telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
This has indirectly shown that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they try their best to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider for some time now, which aims to take another step towards making Telenica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in providing not only fixed, mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson of the group.
Maybe it's a better time.
Unofficial information suggests that the first virtual service provider will be lucky by the end of the year.
His birth is, however, surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider should have a place on the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
To date, we have not been invited by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about Vlastimil Sršeň, the Press Department of Telefónica 02.
The other operators also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson of T-Mobile, exceptionally in agreement with O2, adds: "So far, no viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects have been recorded on which they could be further based."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At this moment, we should have a specific agreement at our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone pays more attention to meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we consider to be the most rewarding in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is a partner for building networks shared for fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - in line with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would lead to an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a decrease in profits.
So why should we make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When it is important for the service providers, they are able to cooperate, the huzavona surrounding the birth of U:fon also bears witness.
ČTÚ is probably under the greatest pressure around the birth of the T-Mobile company's U:phone.
The publicly available information on the website of ČTÚ bears witness to this.
But right now, the U:phone is a good argument as to why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by the access of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would be subject to high requirements."
In view of this attitude of mobile operators, however, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulators is absolutely amazing.
In the meantime, it is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately has no right to interfere in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
However, the office has a characteristic attitude towards the whole problem.
"The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would be possible only after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider was concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," he said, answering our question about Kristián Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Competition Authority.
A statement thus formulated by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from an office that should represent the interests of consumers and, above all, ensure that no one abuses their market position, this is more than odd.
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Outland, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile phone services."
However, the interests of the ÚOHS are likely not to be affected by the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the reduction of prices.
In this case, it is indeed shocking that the three mobile operators' reaction shows quite touching harmony.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, it almost goes without saying.
Just as the exact same petrol prices at the service stations are probably just the works of chance and hard competition.
"The Office has not discovered any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither operator has a leading position, i.e. a proportionately greater responsibility for its market activities.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing by the telecommunication regulator," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leader situation is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the perspective of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech operator in such a market is then in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always necessary for the creation of the virtual service provider.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it's necessarily dominant in a particular segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are acting remarkably similarly.
In the meantime, complaints from a range of interested parties (including the mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
Turning responsibility to ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the UOHS removes their hands from the whole case.
We've seen this before in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecoms law, the extension of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition could not be carried through in the field of telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS need to know this well, but they probably have different interests.
This works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service provider remains undetected, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but which are only partially public.
It's multi-level marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company client against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a prominent customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-emption.
"If there were cases you were talking about, it would be a breach of contract terms that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with the company concerned," replied Martina Kemrová.
But it is highly unlikely that news of this kind of activity would not reach the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, the three companies mentioned may have thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, no service provider defends against such proceedings.
In fact, they have a considerable profit from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual service providers, they are not particularly threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phone, so they cannot fully have it as general customers of mobile operators."
But that's exactly what ČTú should be saying.
In addition, another question arises for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why do they impede the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to expose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect anything of this kind and that their trading conditions prohibit this.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable reduction in the price of services.
Meanwhile, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, regulatory bodies intervened precisely at these moments, which did not in any way protect the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then, even through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider to be followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving each other the whole case.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are useful to them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming out soon, the Czech mobile market may start to move again.
If a provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it is difficult for ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may not be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the State Anthem Where Is My Country on the day of the Czech State.
The anthem was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - male or female solos, choir or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthems.
He has already told the Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young representative singers to sing solo variations, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, both of them, and later also the orchestra, I tried to ensure that the text was clear and consistent," he said.
The Czech state anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first performed in 1834 by Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlovačka, with František Škroup's music.
It became popular, and people spontaneously viewed it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the creation of the autonomous Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven State emblems.
What's the new anthem like?
Prague transport company delivers chip cards for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 enters itself in Prague Transport Company's history on the date when the first passenger to board subways, trams and buses will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save it on chip cards in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at the Muzeum, M
From yesterday, coupons can be purchased via the Internet via the Website of Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who start using online trading can permanently forget the public windows of metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand long lines for their tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card is saved in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have a counter with trained servers to help interested parties purchase online and save their coupons for their cards," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencard in self-service vending machines equipped in some lobbys.
What do these vending machines look like?
Reds, reminding us of ticket managers and the passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are currently five of them in town, but there should be 80 by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon is checked automatically instead of the driver
Their operation tomorrow is easy to handle at start-up machines.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously paid coupon will be saved on its own.
From tomorrow electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city, from 300 to 499, with which the residents of the districts of central Chechnya travel primarily to the capital city.
"On trains classified as integrated transport in Prague, guides were provided with card scanners to determine the area validity of coupons," explained Philip Dráp, who compiled the schedule for Prague public transport.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the cash register at the driver's office.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard in the spot specified on the side of the checkout.
That's how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do so is by adding Drápa."
Passengers who do not travel by buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires can go to self-service vending machines that save coupons for cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the device.
The Sudetes wanted a referendum from the US.
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the attachment of Šumava to the United States.
This can be seen from the letter in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the patronate of the United States of America.
This is supposed to be the wish that some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also apparent from a letter from a private archive, which is now kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Science Library.
The Germans of Česky Krumlov in the letter ask the US President not to allow the return of the "Sumava county" to the Czech Republic, which was occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"The situation has been interpreted correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops are not coming to German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it says in the letter, "People who have the fate of Šumava in their hearts".
Since attaching to Czechoslovakia to the Sudeten Germans is supposed to give hope only to brutality, ruthlessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over Šumava "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be condemned to us as a foreign country that oppresses and destroys the minority, and would not contribute almost anything to the victory of the Allies," states the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign it is said to be a fear of revenge from the "cheese oppressors".
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the department of šumava on whether its inhabitants wish to become part of the United States and live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive with the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians believe that it properly depicts the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have a minimum suspicion that they were being evacuated from the country, only a few of them recognized this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others trusted that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and thrown into the prison camp in Holštynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They trusted that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," said Chalupa.
According to him, no German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war were expected to be evacuated from the country on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for road safety.
This would also be the way to describe the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš řebíček's office hopes this campaign will deter the leaders from acting dangerously behind the government.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, and also on flyers.
You're supposed to scare the drivers away from speeding and alcohol.
And you should remind them to put their seat belts on before they leave.
First and foremost, he wants to address the conscience of young drivers, motorcycle riders, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the commercials?
Emotional attacks, primarily human stories.
That's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" on the license plate is in big letters.
And the blood pool has the word "pay" in it.
This should symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his life.
The audience will be "scared" by advertising spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims can be seen regularly.
They hope to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertising spots were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, release it to the drivers.
"Drivers are subject to the system of pull, release."
For them, 'let' is when they go through the red light, for example, to save time.
Pull is a risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
He thinks the driver's attention signs are less effective.
"If the hazard warning sign is fitted, it is likely that it will quickly merge with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," Kořa warned.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Government of Israel, spoke about the return of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, namely the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan plateau, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that was published daily by Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that we have to return almost all of the (occupied) areas, if not all of them," Olmer said to the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem, and primarily wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, must give up some of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in July, during which a few people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution" in the Old Town "to the Temple Mount, to the sacred and historical places".
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not gonna work," he said.
Evacuation from the Golan plateau
Olmert also gave an opinion on the Israelis' withdrawal from the Golan plateau, which he believed to be an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Síite movement); they must give up regular support for terrorism in Iraq, which is provided by Hamas (Síite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Saint War), the Prime Minister specified.
Questions after an accident: Are cabin attendants illegal in buses?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk in a long-distance bus
Regarding the tragic bus accident of Student Agency, the question arose in the vicinity of the Italian Padova as to whether cabin crew members and passengers could travel in the bus while travelling.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the flight attendant's activities are in conflict with the Transport Activity Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22 - year - old stewardess was likely caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment she sat next to the driver, the least secure place on the bus, although there were two additional seats available for her.
The bus may collide or suddenly brake at the moment when the cabin attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role in whether the bus has a seat according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologed, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; this has been confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jančura to Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and initially the passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the stewardess.
"There is no clear legal whaling about the role of a cabin attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a driver; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Management Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the law handles the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a standing space in its registration.
And that's it," he says.
Buses may be urban according to their distinction, where there are standing places and there are limited maximum speeds, as well as standing places between cities and allowed at a higher speed, as well as long distances without standing places and with seats fitted with safety belts at a maximum authorised speed.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Mr Jaroslav Hořín, transport safety expert at BESIP, sees no basic problem in the movement of cabin crew members on board the bus.
"In the course of continuous progress, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
It's not sure when there's turbulence here, and the flight attendant can bash his head in."
"But if the bus suddenly stops, of course, its physical laws apply.
Just like in city buses or trams.
The safety of cabin crew members must be resolved by the carrier by internal rules," he says, and also believes that the problem has not been resolved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
Student Agency offers cabin crew services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 flight attendants.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be risky.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that the flight attendants' occupation is risky, I will terminate them.
The coffee and the papers can be received by the passengers on board.
This would also be cost savings," he says.
In its vehicles, Alexej Litvin, director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights in comparison with Student Agency, justified the lack of flight attendants for safety reasons.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some kind of fatal injury," he said to Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
The young flight attendant from Plzeň, who worked for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stop zone without using a direction indicator and blocked the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly maneuvered out, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jančura refuses to sell two reserved cabins for the rest of the flight attendants.
"These places can't be booked on long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the truck driver.
By indemnifying the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
Law amendment?
In the distant future
A clarification of the movements of cabin crew members could be reported on board the bus by the amendment of the law, which has been the work of the thirty-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport for more than a year.
"However, the group has not achieved any concrete results.
The buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something which would essentially threaten the safety of passengers," concludes Spokesperson Hanzelka, who concluded that the control of bus safety falls within the competence of the police and labour offices.
Düsseldorf’s hopes depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB’s Board of Directors to the staff of the bank does not lack the big words.
The merger between the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central capital market organisation of the savings financial group", says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the Land banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove their ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the uncertain WestLB bank remains under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the Northern Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution was tight.
For savings bank customers, however, the relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, famous for its investment funds, has been a topic for some time now - also from Frankfurt.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, informed us at the end of August that the merger between the bank on Mainzer Landstraße and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not make any sense.
Despite this, Deka’s Board of Directors, which consists of one half of the representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of the representatives of the savings bank associations, commissioned the Board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
In doing so, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be considered.
However, the negotiations - they say in financial circles - have only just begun.
The name of Deka-Bank, one of the main employers of the Frankfurt financial sector, with its 3000 employees, is not the first to come up in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this triple covenant did not turn out to be anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessen Provincial Government spoke against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks couldn't find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, over and over again the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks has been raised.
However, the last time Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, the need to approach the various banks in the public sector is worth realizing.
After the regional elections in Bavaria, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected to be the first one.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure on further mergers is increased, it may slowly run out of potential partners.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger partner, although the financial crisis has so far been much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85% business share in Helaba.
The NordLB will remain short of better.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how the different business models of each bank fit together.
In June Merl stated that the German Savings and Fat Association had not yet answered the decisive question of what business model to ensure the future of the Landesbanks.
Finally, it is possible to dismember WestLB, which they naturally do not want.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also states that they are definitely seeking a "complete solution".
How this is compatible with the union of individual units with Deka-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "Italian Weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as his girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the five-litre barrel of Kaiser’s brand, stands a man with a strong beard, and insists on some 200 people traveling to Oktoberfest how deep sounds they can draw out of their throats.
Elena first flicks Luca's face and then kisses him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses depart from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova station at 23.45 "destinazione Monaco, Festa della birra" for travel, expected to arrive at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South American people started singing next to their flag, and they started celebrating as early as the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing the long, artificial - headed coat and wide silver - stem glasses.
He's been driving me to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only organized three trips this year.
At night, during the day, on Oktoberfest, at 2.30 p.m.
Accommodation would be a waste of money, Marco says.
The trip costs EUR 75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer cooked in accordance with the Bavarian beer purity law, accident insurance and a tour in German - Marco took a German course in Frankfurt.
And now the buses are jumping into the night on the highway towards Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will be asleep.
All right, you're gonna need your strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several Italian buses take a short break from Munich on motorway 8.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30, as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one final briefing, presenting the battle plan.
First, everyone put on your yellow hats.
On the left of this, the sign in fracture is "Oktoberfest", with the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the beer tent gates open, run," shouts Marco in the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, for we get stuck, and not to the same benches, all the yellow hats, but to scatter in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, screams Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you've behaved well.
As soon as you leave your seats, they will take over!"
Third, "Come back here tonight at 10:30 sharp." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men puts yellow hats on the trees, on the signs, and even on an election poster of one of the great Bavarian peoples.
Prepare to retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no exact figures; there are 50,000 people who cross the Alps who break into the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors to the weekend are supposed to arrive from Italy.
The Munich Police Department is supported by seven South Tyrol police officers, and Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, with some 200 medical care in its national statistics, ahead of the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is particularly popular among the Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück just last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and even said that the German banking sector was not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The Real Estate Real Estate (HRE) in Munich, quoted on Dax, received a billion-dollar loan from the consortium of German banks to protect itself against market turbulence.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation informed Reuters that loan subsidies amounted to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private banks and partly from public banks.
The background is the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
Depfa, a public financer, has reportedly lent money for long-term projects and has refinanced itself to a very short maturity - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of its capital declined moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net proceeds from financial transactions have fallen to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, revenues from crediting claims and specific securities and the liquidation of the provisions of the credit business have fallen to EUR 5 million with a decrease of more than 70 %.
Only due to higher revenues from the reimbursement of the ex-post clearing costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest rates under the Tax Regulation and business for companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%.
After privatisation in 1990, the former State financier first speculated with corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated in Aeral Bank.
Depfa has made a stronger contribution to infrastructure projects and to private-public partnerships (PPPs) between private investors and the state, and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries must now be described by Hypo Real Estate as having a "significant impact" on the profit and loss account of the group, said quite generally.
In fact, there was no dividend payment.
The dividend has already been reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major public and infrastructure investor since the takeover of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than on other financial institutions, as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, lending between banks has dried up because the banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term instruments annually to refinance part of Depfa's loan portfolio, around EUR 50 billion.
According to the Hypo Real Estate announcement, the group's financing needs are covered for the foreseeable time, and the company is protected "from the influence of international financial markets that are currently highly inoperative."
Other sources say that, thanks to the money, refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group did not have to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) see that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now guaranteed.
This gives the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and incomprehensibility of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even inconceivable that there is no need to make full use of funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late-night news of Saturday, the bank was still on the verge of bankruptcy, its temporary rescue could not calm the moods.
The share price fell to EUR 3.30 with a 75 percent drop.
On the other hand, bond rates are holding up quite well.
While the first-place debt hardly changes, the exchange rates of the subordinated bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo and, in a way, the maturity beyond 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds had previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their value-worthiness must now be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, as a result of the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution, by taking over Depfa, almost brought the crisis to its home.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the scheme, they can start from the payment of benefits on a deadline.
Or something that almost no one at the moment dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports on partial nationalisation, the probabilities bordering on certainty have now become mere legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to part with their investment.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on exchange rates gains in the coming years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Inside Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling: The German chick is totally "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - in the new exchange student blog, she talks about Japan.
"The first teaching day in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was scared on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start ringing in from eight o'clock until at 8:40 a.m., a brief conversation begins with the teacher, the home room.
But before school started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've put on an old skirt by my maid, a blouse, blue knee tights, and black leather shoes.
So in this suit I stood before the caterpillar and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - My name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I began to learn the language several years ago.
All 31 girls whispered, giggled and waved, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I know that from my mangaes.
It's a basic vocabulary for Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
And then I took my place fast.
The girl next to me smiled wide and felt honored to be seated next to the exchange student.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the doorbell rang, they ran me by the book.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my belly - but it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their insides.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German lunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, salads made of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat wrapped in tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange, and it tastes completely new.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe except for the salty plum stew, brorr!
In Japanese schools, the inn is not simply lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with a self - made ben, which she especially puts together artistically - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe that here.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm just enchanted."
After all, I've wanted to read the manga for years.
And to understand the comic books and the culture they describe better, I once began to learn Japanese.
It was clear to me, then, that I would have to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are of great value here.
Japan is both a country of the latest techniques and trends and a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or a moth escapes in the event of danger, does that mean that he feels fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have feelings.
How, though, can we examine whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
For years, famous scientists have published their articles in the Internet magazine "Edge".
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series of answers to the question, "What do you think is real without proving it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we can’t even prove that other people are conscious.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of each human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species and dissect the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in difficult terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: Pretending to be dead, running or attacking.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its role in short-term memory and enforcement/control functions).
This broad area is more advanced for humans than for other primates, and it seems to be completely absent for other organisms.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as knowing who we are or, in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals may be excluded.
However, even if it were not dependent on language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness can be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured either as an internal and subjective thing, and because of special hardware it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then our research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my ideas relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is probably more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in short-term attempts at the memory of primates, especially in visualization.
However, this assumption, also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, relies more on the neural connections of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this assumption also emphasizes the importance of prefrontal cortex in visualization.
What does that mean about feelings?
I'm leading this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in a brain aware of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of a protective system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupys a memory of work.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are typical of primates, and especially humans.
In addition to language, perception is divided into fine degrees, because with words and grammar we are able to distinguish and categorize states to describe them to others as well.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that emotions stem from the simpler activities of cortex and brain stem body perceptions, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in the overarching emotions of the species.
I can't, in theory, deny that, but I find it inconceivable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans in both cases probably also feels like: How can it be checked that rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach escapes in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although neural contusion continues to help: rats and humans have the same brain stem, cockroaches have no brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans: how can we prove this in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is expected at the neural level, if measured in rats and humans.
Like rats, I don't research language and consciousness, and I don't study emotion, because I don't know if they exist.
This may seem like a shortsighted approach to others, but I'd rather go ahead than keep hitting the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"In UEFA Bordeaux's decision, the government sees confidence in Ukraine and proof that Ukraine, together with Poland, is capable of organising the European Championship," said Vaszjunik.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to do in both countries."
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work now at the highest speed," said Grigory Szurkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they took an even more radical step.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Alliance, replaced by independent Commissioner Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that PZPN cannot operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We assured Michel Platini, President of UEFA, that this would not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 ECJ."
In the last season alone, several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class due to manipulation, and finally the ligastat had to be postponed.
Outraged Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
The actress wanted to advertise a new movie, and she talked about her private life in the interview, and now she has a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan, Hollywood star, classified her ex-husband Dennis Quaide as an adulterer.
The one who's squandering - and he's fighting back
Late Roses War at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are fighting a nasty fight - in public.
Meg Ryan interviewed the American magazine InStyle for the first time last week about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And only after the divorce did he find out how many women Dennis cheated on her.
The spiritual striptease was due to Ryan's press work on his new film "Women" which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to his disloyal husband's proclamation: "Monstrous," said 54-year-old actor to the newspaper "New York Daily News," "that Meg repeats and spends the story of our relationship."
It is also "sad" that 16-year-old boys in common, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the much pain and change that divorce causes for a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid remarried and recently became the father of a twin.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following sidecut: "My life will continue anyway.
I'm happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in order."
Flight tickets and hotel room prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have become no less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have become more favourable again - so you can summarize one of the results of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established a significant price decrease in the second quarter following the price increase in the first quarter.
After years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices increased by 6.9 percent on average in 41 of the 48 European cities examined compared to 2007.
However, prices have already been 3.6 percent lower in the period April to June than in the previous year.
This trend was shown more clearly in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees the reason for this in the low price of the dollar, which led to the "hot travel pleasure" of American tourists.
The reduction in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannovert, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in the prices of air tickets in the first quarter.
As kerosene increased, passengers in the tourist department had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007 and long-term flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, prices for tourist-class flights decreased on average by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
On the one hand, the reason for the fall in prices lies in declining economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the aviation market.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe, the pressure exerted by the competitive situation is intensifying.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines are cancelling their loss-making flights, and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, it affects 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV was at the top of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find the operational team.
Kristoffer Klein Zooming Deep Flight for the national team Marko Marin.
The gladbach player was only late in the game, and his raise bounced back from the post.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the arena cabins in Hamburg.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break was over, and most of them were in their seats again.
Rieger was the physical therapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys more authority than some former players.
So your request was answered at the appropriate place.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol nodded and showed his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach, Martin Jol.
His command could have said the same thing: Give me the second goal!
The warrant was not executed.
"It wasn't always nice today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt thought it would be "slower" too.
The goal score of 1: 0 (1: 0) is due to the head of the Hamburgers Mladen Petric (11); and to the fact that the very weak gladbachians could not hurt the weak in Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 on Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table appearing on the screen, which represented their team as the top of the league class.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
It is clear that the intermediate certificate of the table indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly thanks to its late-committed compositions - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen acquired from FC Bayern - but not yet.
"We need more sense and trickery," said Jol.
After the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
The first news of the crash of the rescue package has led Dow Jones to a temporary fall of 700 points.
That was the biggest loss of points in his history within a day.
Later, the Dow grew somewhat stronger.
At 8:30 a.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer was down by 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
With more than seven percent minus, Nasdaq was down to 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with 12 percent.
No paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs bank's stock dropped nearly ten percent.
Only a few days earlier, Warren Buffett was buying a stake in the bank.
Under the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage bonds.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive vouchers from financial institutions, which could be used in the event of an appropriate exchange rate evolution, reducing the burden on the state budget.
Downstream European and American and stock prices
Billionaire aid to European and American banks does not dispel investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate's German wholesale stock price is falling, and it's taking Dax.
The American Dow Jones indicator declines despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German share ratio (Dax) to the bottom.
Despite the federal government's and private banks' rescue operations, the Munich real estate funder's stock fell to a quarter, and Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax has fallen below the psychologically important 6,000 points limit and recorded a 3.7 percent minus 5839 points.
Stock markets are on their knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. down 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points.
The U.S. House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, and the Senate vote may take place on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 points after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index went down 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator lost 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax exchange, Arcandor’s shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer private bank has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also stated that Thomas Cook’s shares were not sold.
Dark matter affects space probe flight
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses space probe flew into space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the soon-to- freeze fuel lines, it's threatened by freezing death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational rocking machine of space probes, which generates additional momentum in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like Ulysses Sun probe, used this physical trick.
However, what amazes researchers for many years: Flying objects do not behave fully as would be expected under the ancient Gravity Act.
Instead, there are anomalies in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was called swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which sees the mass attraction of matter as the curvature of space.
American physicist Stephen Adler, associate of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to firmly believe that Einstein wasn't wrong and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark substance discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"Dark matter may be responsible for the anomaly, which may even be found near Earth," says Adler.
The existence of dark matter was only known to space scientists ten years ago.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed for its effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or repel any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists calculate that a good one-fifth of the entire mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Tourists Kidnapped in Egypt Freed
After spending ten days in the captivity of their kidnappers, the tourists dragged away in Egypt are free again - confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shootings prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens were abducted in southern Egypt.
The negotiations on the ransom are under way.
Again and again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are free.
This was reported unanimously by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media.
According to the Italian Sky TG 24 television broadcaster, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our compatriots and the other hostages were released.
We are currently examining their health," said Frattini.
The five German, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, reports Egyptian state television.
19 members of the desert expedition are allegedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain unclear: According to an Egyptian security officer, the hostage takers were already willing to release the hostages when the Sudanese army unexpectedly killed their six.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"The trial was about taking hostages" when suddenly it was "surprise."
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers across the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappers and arrested two.
Hostage takers demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been delivered to one of the hostage's German wives.
The al-Masri al-Jom newspaper reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers release the female hostages after the ransom has been paid.
The men are being held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Suicide" led to stepdad violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, lives in Stithians County, Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The Troro Criminal Court learned that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's confessions, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the trial, it was said that Randle committed suicide at the age of 34 in the Mutley district of Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and blindfolded her in front of intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and rejoined Cornwall.
Stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Ms Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Heritage Organization, was persecuted by the horrors of twice a week repeated violence.
In 2006, D.A. Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle, who previously passionately loved surfing and cycling, said her friends said she was "emotional dead" and "resigned from life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably choked himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had an altercation with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his testimony in a letter saying: "I always tied his eyes and blindfolded him.
I wasn't sexually harassing her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
The fact, however, that if he did not, the case might never have been brought to justice."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact Stephanie's parents have had on your daughter over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost important data has been charged
According to the BBC, a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June is accused of violating an official's secret office.
The man was on a mission from the Defense Department when he left two top secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of intentional action.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defense, said that the move surprised a lot of people at Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defense and the government would treat this case as an internal matter," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, has been charged under article 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph is about preserving information.
The State's Attorney's Office has suggested that the charges against the official should be represented by the Metropolitan Police for his rather sensitive work on the Unified Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to an unknown location.
Housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
UK housing cooperatives can count on an account worth more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits of 2.6 million account holders at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), it is "antagonizing" that companies and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion-pound loan will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime will be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been acting carefully ... must now pay the bills of those institutions which have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that every company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit it holds, and companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to set aside £81 million to pay interest in the first year.
Adrian Coles, director general of the housing company union, told the BBC that he thought the measure was unfair.
"It is outrageous that those institutions who have acted cautiously during the boom of the housing market must pay the bills of the less cautious institutions."
According to the BSA, no company has been destroyed since the start of operations in 1945.
"We need to look at this matter in every way over the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bills," said Cole.
Interest due in 2009 will cover 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a full year's interest will be paid, which may even be twice as high as it is now.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, eventually the members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates on their deposits.
The price of milk increases by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
Jersey's dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by an additional fivepence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year since the two-pence increase in February and after a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Resellers themselves decide whether to pass on price increases to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed lastly in 2002.
The request by the former Member of Parliament of Bangladesh to defend himself at large was rejected.
The Bangladesh court rejected the application of former Member of Parliament, Sheikh Hasina, for protection on the loose, which means that she could be arrested when she returned to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on parole in connection with the charge of extorting 50 million kakas from a businessman during his parliamentary term of office ($729,700).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, demands that the country's military-supported provisional government give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for medical treatment, the conditions for his release do not make it clear whether he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The Court of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail by saying that it was not necessary, since she was already on temporary parole and is attending treatment abroad," we learned from Attorney Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
According to his lawyers, he needs to defend himself on the loose so that he can return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
A leader of the Awami League Party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
He was detained last year after the army-supported provisional government took over, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organised polio vaccination program for violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to a UN spokesperson, this happened despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the work of thousands of vaccination personnel.
BSkyB’s appeal against ITV has been rejected
BskyB’s appeal against the Competition Committee’s decision to reduce its interest in rival TV, ITV, was rejected.
The Court of Appeal of Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its shareholding in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Committee concluded that BSkyB’s share was an obstacle to competition and would give the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB acquired its stake in 2006, thereby effectively preventing NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the BSkyB’s share of ITV would jeopardise ITV’s independence, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
The director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom control, all opposed the acquisition.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its participation in ITV is pointless and disproportionate - especially given that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its right to vote.
Another investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2006 discharge of nine U.S. Attorneys.
The step followed by criticism of the decisions made by government officials by the superintendent of the judicial department.
The report criticised the White House officials, legislators and former state's attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state's attorneys would be dismissed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials who listened to you during the investigation have tried to prevent justice by lying.
"The serious charges relating to a possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," said Chief Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the power to make witnesses testify.
The series began with the removal of nine U.S. Attorneys from his position in December 2006.
At the time, it was said that the state's attorneys were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the dismissed state's attorneys received no worse assessment than many of their colleagues, which led many to conclude that political consideration was behind the dismissals.
Some prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
U.S. Attorneys are investigating and conducting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Justice Department, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks on the rescues, and finally resigned.
A number of other officials of the Justice Department also resigned.
According to the Chief Prosecutor, the Chief Prosecutor is "primarily responsible" for dismissals, "resigned" leadership role, and "extremely excluded" himself from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to the elder Bush, are criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf eposza gets recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will be rewarded at the Q Awards Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer who will receive his special gold prize at the London ceremony next week said that he considered it an honor.
The nine minutes, fifty-five seconds long song was the title song of Meat Loaf's 1977 public-successful harvest album.
Coldplay received the most nominations for this year's prizes, placed in four categories on the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is like that."
Jim Steinman's song required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrumental section.
He appeared as a single in 1979 and reached the 15th place on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" was on the charts for almost nine years, and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf, known as Marvin Lee Aday, has recently suffered from health problems, including surgery due to a heart rhythm disorder in 2003, after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it was discovered that there was a cyst on his vocal cord.
Unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, tours and other side roads, some of them famous, others merely performing practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long - lived local residents find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in the East Village, and it's heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a major traffic route.
There are no street signs.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to rewrap Extra Place and make sure that the new buildings' shops and boutiques can be accessed in a cleaner way.
One of the street admirers is the long-lived neighbors who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past prior to renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city, to insist.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality’s land management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city's care and asked for a new plan next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district manager of the 3rd municipal body.
"There are very few areas in the city's possession, and we want Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for refurbishment and treatment that may be made by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that they wanted to re-envelope the small street and provide seats, some of which would be used by a cafe, to which the builder is expected to lease an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first published at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, they do not insist on having it.
"The most important aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this ruined alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Building Protection Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for developing the buildings and not for managing them.
Compared to his brighter neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place is of little historical significance.
According to some, he was named "nobody's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow stripe.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back exit of CBGB opened to Extra Place, and perhaps the street is the most famous one of the photos on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, scraps of clothing, pieces of barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class took possession of the East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place, arguing that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a virtually unchanged piece of the city and should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the writer of the blog entitled "The Vanishing New York of Jeremiah" ("The Book of Deaths: Bitter Nostalgia in the Process of City Extinction"), posted on his blog part of the story about Extra Place published in the section of the weekly "The New Yorker" entitled "Various Rumour" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is dark even during the day, bounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and shuttered windows, where the wind carries week-long newspapers in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street by the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty 0.75-litre beer bottle lying next to a discarded, fresh pile of newspaper.
Some passersby said they rarely remember Extra Place, but they think it could use a renovation.
Fields said that he felt that some people underestimated his attractiveness in the current state of the street.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuing exposure to the English language environment
Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the views of candidates on bilingual education in this section of the Education Monitor.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, and director of education research, co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why Middle Class Needs School Choice".
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish - speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are included.
According to Obama's campaign, "fro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama's education plan explicitly supports, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, will overcome his interest in combating large performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep contract elementary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state math test.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders passed the excellent English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the means that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the educational principle of the school is the "full immersion" of English students in the linguistic environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We have had a tremendous success in saying that if someone walked into a classroom, they wouldn't know who the student was who arrived from Mexico 12 months before."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama put schools such as Sixth Street Prep in front of other schools teaching a significant number of Spanish-speaking and English students as an example to follow?
The results achieved by the school should be clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it is consistently in favour of bilingual education itself, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama has recently made an understatement when he said that people should not worry so much about the "only English" nature of legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make your children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between the results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down on them and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen sharply due to renewed concerns about the economy
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets would not be able to revive the economy.
The stocks of crude oil dropped by seven percent to $99.80 this morning at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have dropped by over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, stock exchanges have been shaken by the financial turmoil on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before they were again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, anxiety struck investors again, even after the congressional leaders announced that they had managed to reach an agreement on the economic rescue mission, which is the greatest in history.
The news was clouded by concerns that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time.
At the latest events of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up Wachovia Corporation's banking business, announced on Monday by the government.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of desperate weekend meetings, "it seems that the rescue mission has failed to revive the market trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for goods, such as oil, will also be reduced.
"The future of the ordinary shares, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain worldwide," wrote an analyst at Deutsche Bank to investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by "an epidemic".
From the point of view of the commodity exchange, the biggest question is to what extent the USA's "disease" is infecting the whole world, especially China."
As oil consumption decreased due to a slowdown in economic growth, banks' analysts cut off expectations for next year, reducing their oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
With the second quarter's bravo, the team set its record.
After spending more time in Jets than anyone else in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, a defensive end player, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sensational game.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the soft game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds towering in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, which was a perfect forerunner for an afternoon in which their cooperation significantly improved.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks in a row fell ten seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't feel sorry for the trouble," Favre said about all the passes given to Coles.
"Pokoli's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback player Darrelle Revis caught a bad pitch and threw it back 32 yards, which was a touchdown.
Eric Smith, the safety player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker, managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets scored, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34:0 result.
That was the best result the Jets have had in a quarter.
When they asked Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals scored 21 points without Jets winning one - Mangini said: "I must tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
We scored a lot of points in a short time."
Rested Gebrselassie breaks his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many view him as the best mid- and long-distance runner ever lived when he broke his own world record on Sunday in Berlin, making him the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the comfortably flat track victory in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on her previous result at 2:04:26, which she achieved last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set a 26th world record of her career in such a wide range of areas that from 1500 metres to the marathon, she had won World Championships in almost every direction or reached a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps in retrospect - that air pollution would further aggravate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - at sunny time, initially at 9 °C and end at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the previous marathon runners such as Gebrselassie and the Kenyan Paul Tergat turned to the longer distances, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the last decade, since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin with a 2:06:05 result in 1998.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, her two calves had a cramp and couldn't train for two weeks.
Clearly, during the forced rest, he was refreshed and not rusty.
"I'm so glad," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but in the end everything was fine."
He received some criticism - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's Eastern African rival - that he uses too many tools during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, relies on his pacers as if he were running on track and puts world records ahead of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint in 1:02:04 with four Kenyan speed runners on Sunday.
Two high-end Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the runners got tired.
Not much more than 4.8 kilometers ahead of target, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who finished second with 2:05:36, repairing his individual best by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came in third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has completed a remarkable year with her seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with a time of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36 - year - old Mikitenko won a surprise at the London marathon with a result of 2:24:14.
He could not participate because of his alleged back injury at the Beijing Olympics, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he repaired his individual peak by five minutes. This was the third marathon long-distance run he took part in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of four Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, then after about 30 km of running after them.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second in 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and ordeal of black people
In the experience park in Greater Orlando - a few miles from everything that shines, loud and powerful - a quiet small town hides, where the pride and complications of the African-American life experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city that was integrated into the country and which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as he described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courses, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guavas and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage place now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have attended the annual Zora Festival, which is held in the honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the town he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook published by the Project of Federal Writers of the Crisis Age, is separate from his surroundings.
It was as independent, dignified and closed as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that urban blacks in Florida often refused to share their real thoughts with white people, who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama encourages an open discussion on the race issue, many here are distrustful of the looks of outsiders.
"We are very careful how our story is told," reported 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it right."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of black standing, but it is a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty indicators reach twice the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone here calls Hurston).
In the books written in the sincere, strong dialect - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he presented his hometown to the world.
Five sections of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which is located near Route 17. This road leads from Florida’s long forgotten center to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was brave in both life and literature, like drum roll, introduced his readers to the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we find the modern public school, brown with white trim, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller can barely read and write."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodations."
So Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy in a few hundred words, but also to illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
Indeed, this description did not please everyone.
"Zora said things the way they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, who were immortalized by Hurston by quoting the sleazy songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living freak who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
77 - year - old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a thundering Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and trousers in a city where people are still proud of their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed, Franklin said, but a lot of people paid attention.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, swinging in his chair, he added: "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that, along with most of the world, Eatonville had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorials or big public readings.
"I don't think they understood how much he's enriched the world or what he's left us," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003, "In the Rainbow".
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways connecting the states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering after a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battles of racial mixing gave the community a taste of hatred.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court requiring violent integration, saying of the resolution "Brown v. Board of Education": "It offends rather than respects my race."
Today, residents say that although the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the cohesion of the Eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to being hugged - I remember this - by hugging their teachers both in the morning and in the evening," reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, managing director of the nonprofit organization "Let's Keep Meg Eatonville Community".
"This lasted until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Nathiri.
However, human rights have helped the rise of many other Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who have surpassed prejudices, as he has done, with such positive self-confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive himself of the pleasure of my company!
This is beyond my understanding."
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered off to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, on the shelves of bookstores, Robert E. Hemenway wrote a renowned biography of Hurston, which once again placed him among America's role models.
The road construction project would have started just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville was refocused.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the county would ruin with its main road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the ceremony every January.
Several years later, the county stopped proposing road construction.
"Due to the five lanes of the main road, the community was revived, turned to full speed, which means true civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd put it easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the city's self-conceived image.
More and more people from outside the city appeared, such as lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began to attend church here in 1993, and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-story library (of course named after Hurston) was opened, on rehubbed and beautiful Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remains the cuckoo egg of Florida: it is not only 10 km from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during summer rain; it is as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take care of outsiders who come here looking for something to say, the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, depicted by a white man who painted and works in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville, including the confident teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate communities are misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown grew.
In particular, young people increasingly view Eatonville as Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, troublesome, or worse, just as proud, creative, diligent, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is a genuine civil attachment in the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work with the local government or the police, who he believes needs help.
And it seems the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who travel through here think this town is nothing compared to the rest," said Alondra Kenon recently after the service on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know their history, it's a very nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstand booths and the huge television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled beehive-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers, who hold New York in their power, have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still knocking their metal tea trucks down the sidewalks, delivering muffin trays for morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips still shuffle around the blocks, carrying 50 ironed shirts as human mules, hanging from a yokelike loop across their shoulders.
The office staff are still waiting in line for their sweet breakfast pastries on the sidewalk for food trucks, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on weekdays.
I didn't feel like there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Although I purposely planned to take care of it during the afternoon’s quiet in the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank, I had 20 people in line for me.
Not at the bank teller's window, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the "ordered" banker - stood in line with the same intent as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money out of smaller banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money out of so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit unions and small-town savings banks operating in only one state and allegedly treating their customers as family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone down quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, has been in bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers left on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made a savings of $440 billion to save a bank saver.
The office and shop workers before me, fearing another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven for the bank that was buying out most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become experts in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store on her phone spoke of the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and its huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
Lyn, the janitor of my apartment block in uniform, in his 50s, changed the subject, and we're not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food shipment, like we used to.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market assets.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves were being desecrated while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian right-wing party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in which the organisation "Varriers Against Islamic Continuation" was introduced.
They marched with signs of traffic signs depicting mosques crossed red lines.
According to the police, extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for desecrating Austrian Muslim cemeteries on the same weekend as the extreme right-wing parties significantly advanced in the national parliamentary elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traunine cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators used paint sprayers to draw Jewish symbols, such as the David Star, on some graves, but according to investigators, they were merely trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow associated with the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shaken" at the sound of grave desecration, which took place shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience inquiry following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the political balance language tilted to the right.
The two far-right parties, which obtained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance of Austria, for a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party with over 18% of the votes, expressed his disapproval of the campaign against headscarves and burkas, as well as of the food allegedly associated with Islam.
At the party's final assembly in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood", which helps prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamisation of Austria and Europe.
According to polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections leading to the victory of the far right, the change was due to the largely young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from travelling abroad.
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of child rape, was banned from his trip to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after he informed the authorities controlling him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police obtained a ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of child rape convictions against Glitter.
Glitter, known as Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesman said: "Thursday, September 25, Kent police filed a request with the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it was bound by the law applicable to those involved in the register of sex offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years in prison.
The Kent police said they didn't want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and possible whereabouts.
We learned from the Kent Police spokesperson: "The Kent Police are doing everything they can to protect children inside the country and abroad.
"We believe it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the UK, because we have a comprehensive system here so that we can manage the potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police Department is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and those in the county to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for the rape of a 10 and an 11 - year - old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The country authorities refused to let him pass the passport check, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where the local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the court in West London, uxbridge, because according to Scotland Yard's request, he was entered in the register of sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for the possession of photos of child rape in 1999.
According to a source at the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Home Affairs, was relieved and pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the artist from a personal side" Photographer Günther Bauer
No set, no ruffles, no dancing shoes.
The great masters of flamenco are close by, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday faces of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate moments far away from the audience, when we can watch a personal movement, grasp the depth of a captured look, or marvel at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of an artist not about to perform on stage.
In the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people photo series, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarists with this less-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, the unique iconography of flamenco is presented from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Month, "reflects the increasing international importance of flamenco every day," the creator believes, adding that Flamenco-people could be a "actor" of anyone, since in view of the images, the observer realizes that these images do not represent artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and enslave the audience.
On the other hand, stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their personality and character reside in the depths of their beings.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave Bauer the impetus to his long journey in 1997, where he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a record camera.
Thanks to the camera and the choice of subjects, these portraits quote classical photography.
However, the application of various stylistic tools breaks off with traditional visual representations and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which changes day by day and is always fascinating."
It's not the dance itself, it's not the music itself, it's the artist's personality and character that charms the audience.
Recently, the leading motif of the works seen in the El Fotómata gallery is the search for an encounter with the essentials, the artistic sewing, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and visualization.
Known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are hallmarks of this collection of photographs presenting almost 60 artists.
The project also became flamenco anthology, which will soon be published with an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits inspired him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "PortARTproject" series "PortARTprojects of Veteran athletes".
Although Flamenco-people has a slightly different concept, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you meet people you don't even know sometimes, or you just take a few minutes to shoot.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
A selection of contemporary flamenco portraits, entitled Flamenco-people, can be seen in El Fotómata Gallery at the Kalle de la Mata 20 in parallel with Alameda de Hércules until October 16th.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "ready reckless"
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing his novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for 20 years and was also in Amazonia.
Yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event, the writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literary Arts admitted that his current work is "ready reckless" and "all signs indicate that the novel should not be written".
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I hope that I will come to an end at some point," he concluded his presentation at the festival of exchange of ideas, ideas and views, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors for four days in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the festival of literature, and he fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend". His performance filled the Juan Bravo theatre.
After the greeting of Felix Romeo, a devoted audience received him. For the public, the hour soon went by, during which the Peruvian writer explained with amazing memory and a great amount of humor how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas evolved from the special adventure of his passion for reading and the desire to live; how to bridge the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing methods, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewrites; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas worked on his writing vocation, and what his stories were based on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but he added: "I do not think literature is pure entertainment or a life-long experience" because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of ease and to be held responsible for their vocation.
Because of the weather, the Pozoblanco goodbye is shorter, horsefighting is cancelled
The horsefighting traditionally held as the closing stage of the Pozoblanco holidays was cancelled yesterday morning after the future horse bullfighters found the ground of the arena unfit for the tournament.
As a result, the committee, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided not to fight bulls.
During the weather, two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain was the second bullfight.
Future protagonists José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista would have fought bulls from Castilblanco.
So they only had a bullfight on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, and he took home three ears as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was carried around shoulder to shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante gained a number of recognitions and trophy ears through his two bulls, but this was due to the audience rather than to his own performance.
But then El Juli, who had little to do with augmenting the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to lose their temper.
In general, a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape traffic control.
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Regional Police are carrying out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiño (Alava).
The authorities are stopping a van with two passengers in it, and the passengers are trying to escape the measure.
The shipment, over two tons of hashish, was not noticeable at the same time.
Investigators chased passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., said the Basque government's Home Affairs Department.
The man in custody is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident took place in the administrative area of Armiñón, where traffic control was carried out by the employees of the Álavai Traffic Control on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and then left the control site.
Investigators chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few miles down the lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after inspecting the Iveco Daily van, they seized its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hashish.
Hashish bales filling the rear part of the vehicle were transported by police bodies to investigate and measure the drug more thoroughly.
In addition, during the inspection, it was proved that the vehicle's false registration plate did not match the data in the van's papers, so the arrested person will also be prosecuted for forgery of an authentic instrument.
The Basque Regional Police continue the investigation, which aims to arrest the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, has fled the motorway and, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was sent to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours, court measures began.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by the police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
According to one witness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers, said People magazine, a spokesman for traffic control in California.
According to the witness, at around 16:30, Locklear "put the gas to the floor, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forward and backwards, and passed through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially crippled the highway traffic.
"It seemed a mess," so patrols took him to a specialized center for drug and alcohol tests.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded, and the spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of officers, she was believed to have been under the influence of Locklear.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of being driven under the influence of an unidentified drug.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Ms Llamazares called on the IUU (United Left) Andalusian Federation to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and representative of the United Left, stated today that the regional Federation of the Corps will decide the case of former Sevilla City Councillor Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of using his position as a abuse of the benefits of his family members.
"In these matters I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter is indeed within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the way in which the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the president of the IU stressed that the "transparency" must be borne in mind in the detection of irregularities that Silva may have committed: "At IU has always advocated that cases of this kind be fully transparent."
He added that part of the training was "the strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May blood" by Garcia's epic creation
The work of Benito Pérez Galdós, entitled National Epizods, inspired José Luis Garci, who recalls the famous anti-French uprising of the Spanish in May blood, which, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flood of people and social analysis he had always admired in his well-known novelist work. Today at the film premiere, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the audience of actors.
The more than two and a half hours of May blood will be presented in the cinemas on Friday, and later Telemadrid will be screened as a mini-series in excess of four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, realized his childhood dream with this film. He owes all this to Esperanza Aguirré because three years ago he commissioned Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the basis of the story can be given by the National Epizods.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the Madrid Autonomous Province and was a special opportunity for Garcia: he could present the confused Spaniards, who mistakenly sided with the wrong leader, because the struggle for independence brought the country to a huge hindrance with Ferdinand VII's reign," he said.
However, the director regretted that he could not count on the budget of the Phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, which were more than double the May blood, which forced him to leave out some of the scenes that were recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell, as on many other occasions.
So the director of the re-start resorted to his usual method of work, recording the scenes with the actors with whom he started the rehearsals before shooting. Casting was not, because Garcia considered it "demeanor" and because, as he said, "it's part of the director's craft to go to the theater and to the movies to find out what's going on in the industry in which we work."
Several actors of May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have not been on camera for the first time.
Garcia, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar award, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. May blood, the Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected Blind sunflowers represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented," he said.
With this movie, Garcia doesn't expect awards.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that it's all about getting well, and finally you're happy to have another film made," says Garcia with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Tortola Valencia, a dancer from Seville
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates a dancer from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in the Triana district and moved to London with her parents when she was three years old from Catalan father Florenç Tórtola Ferrer and Andalusian mother Georgenina Valencia Valenzuela.
He was an artist of free dancing and an expert on Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he pioneered women’s equality, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought against wearing a corset that prevented women's freedom of movement.
He started a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, his life dazzled Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, who recommended Tortola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell his life story, but to capture his soul.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, the tango of the "string of the butterfly" to the guaji or the "dance of the serpent".
"He danced sensually and, according to others, my style is the same," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Door at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Totola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to my request. I'm very honored to see you perform in my play."
In addition, music directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, singers el Pulga and Moi de Morón; Batterer El Pajáro, viola Rafa, and actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays a constant character that constantly sieges the true diva with his love."
The piece also largely presents the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels Europe, and goes to faraway lands at that time, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great influence on his own age, but they no longer know him and value his work even less," says Bayo.
The performance starts tonight at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the diary of a newly-married poet appears.
The first illustrated edition of the Diary of a newly married poet will be presented at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of the programme series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
In this way, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium's closing point are the re-release of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Bright Poplar Tree". The exhibition opened in May this year, attended several Andalusian provinces and is scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government obtained a total of eight hundred copies of the diary of a newly married poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn't that attractive.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with Newman in The Victims of the Sensation, and reflects the shock and inertia that Newman's death caused in the American cinema industry and throughout America.
How hard it was for him to get the Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
And he was known to be ill,
But still, everyone was shaken by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and now I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or overdoing it.
A hero of the cinema and the country went through a particularly dark period of fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self - esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people to look up to, then there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of humans, he really embodied the platonic idea of beauty and truth.
He was the formal enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and won cases, from the anti-drug foundation created in memory of his firstborn son who died of drug overdose to the creation of his domestic organic food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that had difficulty going beyond its suicidal eating culture.
The overwhelming wave of admiration has traveled all over Hollywood regardless of nationality or origin.
According to the last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, it was not a man, it was an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his biggest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: they demand honesty and serious and remote privacy.
This is not always easy, if at all possible in the midst of today's media jungle.
Still, some people try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
He was divorced once, but then he was married to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and he certainly would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why do I have to eat burgers somewhere else when I've got roast meat at home?" he joked.
You can be proud in heaven that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"He was not as proud of any of his performances as the role of the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted philanthropist," they say.
The Obstacle Road of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympics in Madrid, and after 2012 failed, it may become 2016.
But, I'm asking, are we really prepared for it?
Because if we're starting out from yesterday's race, I don't think we are.
They called it the perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of many I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a lot of incomprehensibility, and if I ever had to appreciate it, and I was the examiner, it would definitely fail.
But first things first, let's start at the beginning.
The senseless things started with the number being taken over, as this required an early arrival.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go earlier, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in a later row).
That's not what happened.
At first they handed over only the number (first nonsense, only to go there earlier) and (after the usual queue) how surprising, it was only a S T-shirt (second nonsense, because I have the exact XL size)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, did they decide to save money and just buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still dwarfed by what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the horrendous early picking up the chip, the queue lasted 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race of more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't dropped off the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant to wait more than 40 minutes for people to rise and stand attack experiments.
I think maybe 500 of us will get pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, won't get our place with our actual time, because I assume my chip recorded the launch wrongly.
If you ask me about the perfect race, I wouldn't happen to think of that.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for a receptionist
At MIT's Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not very intelligent - artificial intelligence, which can, however, perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in Microsoft's case, a vehicle on the company's territory) based on information from the conversation.
This "reception" is capable of identifying the number of people in the room, who they are - and even notes what they wear - and also hears and understands the keywords of their conversations, using a camera and a facial recognition system.
In addition, you can group the people present based on your conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist lady identifies a third person, but she knows she's not part of the company she's talking to and she's not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's come to visit someone and makes sure he's coming to his aid soon.
All without the big blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, this is the music of the future.
At present, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft was changing strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contains fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers ran the necessary programs instead of all the commercial junk, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
Spaniards have been invented, given that Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
The change of direction will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming increasingly marginalized, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google was the first step towards becoming a competitor of Windows.
Many have correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed, as it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system is to be reckoned with, not in absolute terms, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is turned on only to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we spend in the world of windows.
What are most applications associated with the system for, then?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less heavy, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services on-line rather than ultimately provide an alternative to Google.
They really need all this, and I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a lounge designed for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster asks them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It does not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the slippage, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely make their business worse.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in the blood diamonds of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the Godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the basic clothes of the hardened gay customer.
And speaking of specialties, we might as well recall the peace figure of the traveling circus's bearded mustache lifter.
But what are we talking about here?
I mean, "tank," as the English call it, but none of the competitors of le Fabuleux with Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although known as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to sport, according to legend, it was named after Marcel Cerdan's boxer, singer Edith Piaf's lover.
Marcel's excellent cotton fabric, unisex tailoring, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag are also visible among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most characteristic models hidden in the neck of the shirt.
However, the Belgian company does not just make tank tops.
Sports shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, sailors' shirts, baby clothes, ministacks - and they're all one of the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable undergarments,
Although it is also regrettable that they should be worn as undergarments.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is"
He is very much like his brother, but at the same time he managed to achieve himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters want to play a more important role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than some pretty and pretty girls putting their name on something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris and at the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
It gives rise to ardent warmth and mildness.
What exactly are you doing in Paris?
We are presenting Mango's new autumn-winter collection, which my brother and I designed with Penalope, and we are also attending the announcement of the second 'Mango Fashion Awards' competition and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango.
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; from there we took over a lot.
And then, sometimes I just walk around the city and watch women dress up, how they change and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, actress, and fashion designer.
That's what I think, but after all, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was little, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and go through my aunt's closets.
Now, that was the Canaan itself, almost worth an amusement park.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to watch my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for lessons and rehearsals so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in acting as an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, everything is connected to everything, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever felt, I love the '30s.
I think that's when women are really worth it, they're experienced enough, and they make fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and in fact, I want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
As for the father-to-be, no matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you made a couple of movies that haven't even been introduced.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theater, am very impatient and anxious, want everything immediately, but I know that's impossible.
I look forward to being presented with the last hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you think of them.
I understand you made your debut on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization called Women for a Better World.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much going on about him, and I know him, and I can assure you that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his activities.
He asked me to go to the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do that.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know anything impossible.
Repeated drunk drivers will be required to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk-driving offences, the Ministry of Interior would require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from being launched if the driver was drunk or not blowing into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the State's Attorney's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
Since the aim of the project is to return to the market, the driver will also have to take a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor’s Office for Transport, DGT and the Foundation for Auto Safety Technology (FITSA) participate in the experiment.
According to the statistics, 30-75% of motorists arrested several times for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air sprayed in it. If it is greater than the permitted or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the infringer.
A relevant study in the USA in 2007 demonstrated that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 lives a year.
The measure focuses on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from turning into criminal offences;
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, since the implementation of the legal reform is in the normal course of action, whereas the necessary reform in criminal matters would require an amendment of the basic law.
The instrument is not yet commercially available on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in experimental mode in some industrial and public vehicles.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party which, on a French sample, calls for the system to be installed in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English precision, at 17:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force’s Prince’s Party of Asturus landed in the presidential hangar of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was on its way down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs stood the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Princes were coming to town for an official visit.
Okay, well, there's not gonna be any airport transfers for a while, so... she's from around here or something.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish. She just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, I mean...
But the Mexican press knows all about the Princes of Asturus and the significance of their visit.
There are many waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon made by 27 marine soldiers, who protect dignity.
The Prince shows up, smiling, in a sea blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, is caught in the wind, in a restrained dress, but not in her usual toes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception comes.
At the gate of their hotel, one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are waiting for a reporter of Mexican television.
The Most Valuable Fashion Prize
The best place in the world to award a fashion award is undoubtedly Paris, and the most sophisticated and the coolest fashion designers today are Valentino.
Mango has recently launched the second tender for El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the young talent of the fashion industry internationally.
The prize is EUR 300,000.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first tender, saw her own designer clothes in the window of Mango under 54 at the Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and was almost tearful.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and recently opened on 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is located in London.
We finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagalok, the board of the gala dinner made by Mango was even more spectacular.
Nati, who had recently arrived with a heavy heart and sadness because of the death of her brother, wore a piece of the Company and some breathtaking ornaments of the ELAH. She accompanied Valentin to the main table of dinner with his son Luis, nearly two metres tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests. Along with Baron Rothil, they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own-designed pants and shirts, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. On the night of her opera visit to Gaya Toledo’s company, she became so enthralled in the ballet hall that, recalling the old days, she fell onto one of the poles and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but before that he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he was about two meters tall and on a motorcycle - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him and told me in advance that he would not ask for any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress relief number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000 and there's one way to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
Further good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at bookstores on September 30 to bring peace with it.
It's almost torture to hear the clock ringing at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think how fast-paced the world forces you to live every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the people's disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and to bridge work problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book, so that everyone can find the solution that is best suited to his free time.
The stress relief work is called the 1001 relaxation method, and the tranquility from it comes to the bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be eliminated from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly sway your faith.
In addition, it also provides other ideas that help you relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels have become too low to refresh your body and become a central stress problem, it is time to sit back in the chair, relax and focus only on reading.
Who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem frightening at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It's quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of them have been told that you spoke at night.
As regards its frequency, it may be completely rapsodic (for example, it occurs only once in a case of high fever) or more systematic (every day, once a week or once a month), and usually the next day the child does not remember anything.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single underlying cause.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, alarms at night, nighttime bed wetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As mentioned above, it can be accompanied by a high fever or even a stress situation or a high excitement.
In any case, it's been under-researched so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, may consist of incoherent words, murmurs, but in contrast, it may also appear in the form of shouting, crying, or more prolonged speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is a major anxiety problem behind it and thus offer a solution.
As mentioned above, this is a benign phenomenon and therefore there is no cure unless it is accompanied by another treatable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
But there are a few things we can do, and here's a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose comforting games and avoid children watching fear - inspiring or aggressive TV shows or shows.
For children who tend to be nervous or have difficulty relaxing, we teach them some relaxation methods to make it easier for them to find inner calm.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If he does start talking while sleeping, let's try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful Advice
Do not wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the child is unconscious, but he would be out of sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's actually still sleeping and resting.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by severe anxiety more than once, it is advisable to contact a specialist or explore what causes a child to become deeply anxious.
If you speak plainly (this is the rarest case), do not start asking questions to learn anything from him.
It would be unnecessary, since when you sleep, you are not conscious enough to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and the possible conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
It's causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episodes.
At last, the Illhaeuern straight
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeuern team finally gained new momentum and won a victory back home.
Although it wasn't an awesome game, the yellow-blacks were put in several situations, one of which they could finally win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty getting the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball only touched the upper corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeuern took the lead, and the shots followed each other: Fonderflick tried a far shot, and then Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain ratted, Diebold also tried to sway Dannemarie's defense with a distant attempt.
On the other side, the players grouped together in a block to defend themselves on the midfield, and only the ever-moving Riahi got shot.
The beginning of the second half was critical: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after Diebold's first shot, the ball bounced out with an excellent position in Marais, illhaeuserni, then put it in the gate (53 minutes).
However, the goaler of Illhausern could not enjoy the glory for long: 12 minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue the battle at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who had just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defense. Only the last few seconds had some excitement when the ball got very close to the goal.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration by the fishermen paralyzed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with representatives of demonstrators.
The latter promised to receive the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "specific proposals".
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the "crisis committee", which was set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in the price of gas oil as the oil price exceeded the average price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, spokesperson of the President of the Republic, said that the president "will negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and pay safer for seafarers".
The fishermen are eagerly awaiting Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, traffic slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, causing congestion of nearly 10 km.
They also disabled the passage of Quiberon's marina, but the roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
Road blocks have been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, sailors had already demonstrated their determination. At that time, at dawn, tyres and pallets were set on fire outside the fuel depots at the Brest ports, while protests took place in both Concerteau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further action in other ports of the Atlantic Coast and La Manche. In Sables d'Olonne, Vendée County, for example, fishermen did not board ships, while in Le Havre, some 20 ships were blocking the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, in Loire-Atlantique County, closed the huge oil refinery blockade of Total in Donges at night.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the Ministry to decide on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on its next move and participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues," said Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission, "because "fishers do not give in to their demands" and "will not go to Paris."
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" had an unforgettable title in Connecticut's home at the age of 83 due to death and cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid their respects to Paul Newman, an actor dedicated to the cinema legend and vocation who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its delivery plans for 2008
Despite the global economy crisis, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, can keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian production company is highly relevant to the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers over eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the 85 billion dollars in advance, reports the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and American pension insurance activities, AIG would withdraw from most of its other branches, the newspaper quoted resources close to the case.
According to the Times, the Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sale.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the company's International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, no final decision has yet been taken on the sale.
AIG must quickly acquire liquid assets to repay the USD 85 billion loan approved by the US government, thereby taking the risk that it will have to divest 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in a corresponding proportion.
Paris Historique Study on Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic downturn on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson bailout plan. The Dow Jones index fell by 6.98% (which represents an unprecedented decrease of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is down by 777.68 points, thus closing at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest drop in the index so far (684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed following the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq, which is mainly based on technological papers, closed at 1 983.73 points, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500's expanded index decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street stock market was failing even when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it went deep.
Members rejected the provision of funds requested by the Finance Minister Henry Paulson against 228 votes "no" against 205 votes "yes".
Nearly two-thirds of the Republicans voted against the plan.
"From this, the market has filtered out bad signs, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial analyst.
"It shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were accepted a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really doomed (...), then it will be up to the Fed (American central bank - the ed.) and the other central banks to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to tighten," warns Brian Bethune, the leading economist of Global Insight.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "Every day passed, a new financial institution goes bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia’s banking business was acquired by its rival Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has suddenly accelerated, which has called for emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has "a crisis not only in America but worldwide", adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has grown considerably.
The 10-year government bond yield fell from 3.827% to 3.632% by Friday evening and the 30-year-old dropped from 4.357% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television duel
On Friday, the first debate of the two American presidential candidates was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would come out of the duel as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign leaders have declared victory their own in the television duel that one third of American households have watched.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove to be "encouraged" enough to stop him from losing popularity: this is evidenced by surveys taken five weeks before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate stands better in the fight: according to the polls published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most calculating, undecided voters, 39% of the respondents say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his protagonist, Joseph Biden, who is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts."
McCain, in his 70s, never fails to prioritize his own, undisputedly enormous foreign policy experience. However, he emphasizes his opponent's "naivity" in these matters, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..."
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge for the presidency," McCain said.
This is the main attack area that is being exploited by the Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he put it neatly and accurately.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the world’s image of the United States.
"McCain still doesn't understand it, but Obama already does" - a Democrat ad broadcast over the weekend, which puts the Republican leader in the eye of the fact that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "people of the street".
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
He didn't even utter the words "middle class" or "workers" on his lips. The troubled situation in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week could prove to be a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic Senator yesterday.
A Democrat representative of Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton government, said that Obama has "excellent instincts in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the "final judgment over eight years of bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed his ability to reduce the tax burden on 95% of Americans, despite the fluctuations in the stock exchange. He added that his primary objectives were to create a possible energy independence for the country through the use of renewable energy sources and to create a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully eluded issues related to the $700 billion (€470 billion) bank rescue plan: the extremely unpopular plan was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: "Did you notice there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening on the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected results of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after closing polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square to protest against falsification of election results.
Although results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko in the following words: "Dictator, resign!"
Some admit that they didn't even vote: "Why would I go? They're doing what they want with my vote," says a young man.
Protesters do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself visible to foreign observers for the purpose of establishing relations with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were to be ruled clean by observers, they could lift the sanctions imposed on the country, which denied 40 Belarusian leaders visas and frozen some bank accounts.
According to the opposition, however, the elections did not take place cleanly.
"We were kept away from the election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting" – regretted Yuri Potyemkin, spokesperson of the twelve parties, so heterogeneous United Democratic Forces Coalition.
"The changes were only nominal," emphasises Alexander Milinkievic, opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes, and in our case this executive power.
If opposition delegates get into parliament, that means they've been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to sit on television, to meet in the country's regions and to submit laws.
The opposition must therefore take the stage in political life, because "a dialogue with the European Union must be initiated".
Because if our economy is heavily indebted to Russia and we cannot be renewed, we risk falling under Russia's authority.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which monitors the election process, will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high, and the wide-ranging organisation of prior voting (with 26% of voters in Minsk) has given any manipulation.
"Did you notice that an election took place here?" asks the Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, who was released in August this year as the last one from prison, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling stations.
Parliament will include up to five opposition representatives, namely those who are best suited to leadership.
To October Square, the silence of the night again.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission rejoice.
Blood Safe Again
Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Héma-Quebec has become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world today.
Most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of people, which was severely shaken by the scandal of infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As it is known, the national blood reserve managed by the Red Cross blood supply in Canada was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general upheaval, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation in February 1994, led by Judge Horace Krever, which was intended to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While Judge Krever has delayed his report, some provinces have set up their own committees to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee had this task.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one is Hema-Québec, the other is Héma-Québec, the other is the Canadian Blood Supply Company, responsible for all the provinces and the two territories.
"When Héma-Québec began its activities in 1998, only 38% of the people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field, we have managed to regain the trust of people." Décary proudly states that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population considered Héma-Québece to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since the foundation of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, the principle of caution has been applied.
During this period, many cases of mad cow disease, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been in charge of the company since its foundation in 1998.
"We had no idea that this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we have been relying on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and there is a risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which causes brain changes, which inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from persons who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that we had reason to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows a more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which is able to detect the virus directly in the blood of blood donors, rather than antibodies against the virus on which the tests used earlier were built.
Using the NAT test, we were able to shorten the window period, which takes as long as we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
Thus, they significantly mitigated the risk of unknowingly infecting blood cells by blood donors, and that this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should distribute 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400 and 500 thousand blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and someone to become infected with HIV via a blood product.
I think that anyone can now accept or prescribe blood transfusions in order to restore health, says the number one leader of Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen will enter the system.
After all, it was only last year that the chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we need to keep an eye on it," Dr. Décary continued, and stressed that in addition to emergency reserves, Héma-Québec should provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The ageing of the population also increases the demand.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects blood donors, as the number of people in the network capable of donating blood accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person at least 18 years of age who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in countries where malaria kills are not eligible for blood donation for a year.
"With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that existing ones are getting older, because they can't give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even more difficult to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's rushing world, man barely has a single hour to go and donate blood," regrets Francine Décary.
Héma-Québec, an annual budget of USD 297 million, provides not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which is used almost exclusively for severely burned persons.
These tissues are analyzed, modified and frozen, and then placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
Only a cord that has been treated as medical waste can be extracted from blood that is rich in stem cells, including severe diseases (such as leukaemia).
"Some weeks ago, we celebrated the entry of the thousandth cord blood sample into our bank, and we plan to take over a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the cord blood removal program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad that they do not have the opportunity to do so" - indeed, because Héma-Québec is not able to make this complex and costly program available in all Quebec hospitals.
Football - semifinal of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders at the USL-1 qualifiers by 3:1 yesterday and reached the semifinal with a total 4:3 result. This was the second quarter-final and the final match, which took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by Antonio Ribeiro in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second half, two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, both found their way into the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one on the Sounders team who managed to play Matt Jordan's goalie.
Let's remember that in his first game on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
Impact is playing Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, who lost 3:1 from Whitecaps in the first match, won 4:3, but in the semifinal, Whitecaps reached the semifinal with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are specified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winner goal
The Canadians' favorite triad is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won 3:2 shots against the Florida Panthers at the Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the match with two goals, and Kovalev finished with one goal, which was the fourth victory of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel in shape."
"He tried too much of himself in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the match.
He got a huge ovation."
Charest's northern aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year.
Just after the Liberal Party meeting ended, Jean Charest left for Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister, Yves Bolduc (left side) is trying to win the interim election today.
"Restraint our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party in Québec, in Lévis. The speech was enriched with visual elements, but at the same time the president sought to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back, he screened images similar to "Moulin à images".
The three giant projectors were followed by impressive images: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's "vision" of Quebec's future, embodied in a "new economic area", which includes a labour treaty with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (the northern area starting at latitude 49) has often been mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a talk on this subject.
However, the head of state merely explained why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine full of huge potentials". However, he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or specific priorities for future projects.
It has highlighted only a few development opportunities: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries in the catch-up and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, he listed Chares as "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds".
This area, which is "two times the size of France", is our territory, Quebec.
It is not only in us, but also in us," the head of state repeated, stressing that it aims to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold rush in Abibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future," he added, after examining the huge map behind his back with a dramatic pause.
The North, which covers 70% of Quebec, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for itself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reconfirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he said.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister said, "We also need to reconsider our view of the North in the light of climate change", talking about the northwest passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the polar ice.
In the view of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical context, the occupation of the territory is an important task.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec pays particular attention to them and that the plan will benefit young people in particular.
The two ministers of the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (the latter was delegates of the Parti Québécois ungava) have already started the negotiations with about thirty local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources), has also started to function.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where "common vision is created".
The North would otherwise be developed in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister said.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers prior to him.
"Like the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president on Friday.
One of the adopted decisions proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout dam.
"The politicians of our group, including the Hydro-Québecet founder Godbout, Lesage, who carried out the silent revolution and the national distribution of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourusssa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another - true, conservative - work by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 to 1963, "Roads to the North".
As regards the plan of the dam of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest pointed out that the deployment was planned for 2012.
"This is between you and me, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was received by a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude a vote to be held this autumn, which the law also allows him to vote.
However, he stressed that his calendar was already full, as he took on tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to explain nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without hesitation. This is mainly about the "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party in the Constitution calls for recognition in particular of the "specific nature of Quebec".
They also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, sceptically received the main points of the Northern Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, re-launched the North Quebec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came into power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't done so, "we would be much ahead today," said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who took the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"However, we would like this not to be a mere act," said party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont who returned from his freedom today.
Leaves - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (and also Minister of Justice) took the liberty of calling Louise Arbourt Canada "true".
To desecrate a woman who has always fought for justice and deserves all our admiration - that tells us a lot about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, who alone of the Western countries concerned did not return his own national from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of his crimes.
This is the only government that, even though Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and allowed a child soldier to suffer in inhumane circumstances.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet show while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian attorneys' association are demanding Omar Khadr's return to Canada so that he can receive a fair trial.
And our government turns a blind eye to the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and all these years of torture probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this yet, at present, our rights, our freedom and our democracy are under attack. "Democracy": Harper constantly utters this word, which sounds like an empty voice from his mouth.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture, and imprison any Canadian citizen, according to the will of the leader of a government which has been a minority until now (and what can come after 14 October...?).
Many electorate believe that salvation can be found in a party that praises virtue, the Law, and the Order. They do not see this government trampling on the values that our country owes its reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, shame is more this - don't look elsewhere.
Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwell speech
In the September 17th issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published by Patrick J. Garver, the deputy president and CEO of the Canadian Barrick Gold mine.
Following Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold company has filed a $6 million defamation suit against three authors and a small-money publishing company in order to initiate a so-called "public debate".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation cases, is made not on the basis of the truth, but by the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way to have a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend considerable money on defence and struggle in an unequal fight where, on the other hand, there are an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources of the mining industry.
In such an unequal struggle, it is often the tactic of destroying the defendant and concluding a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite, but even intimidates those who try to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views to the public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada, disputers do not usually strike each other with sticks, but express their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have been sufficient to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying for independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust public opinion and, in a single move, sweeps aside requests and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how you can initiate a "public" debate if, at the same time, you ignore this public opinion?
In the mind of the vice president, this word probably only means the highly paid lawyers, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept narrows down considerably.
In a democratic state, even those who abuse others deserve freedom of speech.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are primarily supported by the public because it condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but this would be done on the basis of civilized arguments rather than by a lawsuit for silence for many. (In relation to the term "public debate", Barrick Gold has recently called on Noir Canada authors to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal discussions of Garver, Barrick Gold's process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are building blocks of all democratic societies.
The procedure as a whole denies the right to quote credible sources and to a debate on the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If in a country like Canada you can only study and discuss matters that are not pleasing to the rich companies of today’s world, will you take the liberty of doing so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to respond.
We have been able to handle disputes, disagreements and conflicts in our university community for a long time.
Barrick Gold's unthinkable procedure shows that, contrary to what it claims, it is not in the mood to have an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to finally introduce measures that restrict legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - Democrats and Republicans have an agreement
The Bush government and the Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue mission, which has been the largest such plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The 700 billion US dollar plan to contain the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to non-payments; right of access to the salaries of the managers of assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, US Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. House, and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively in the markets," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," explained the Democrat representative.
"The most important aspect is that if we do not do this, there will be great shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans," said Republican Representative Judd Gregg.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
They gave themselves a deadline for the agreement to open the stock market this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations late showed willingness to reach an agreement, but they did not welcome the fact that the situation had increased to the very end.
Senator Barack Obama, a Democrat, attributed himself to the expansion of the agreement with elements such as provisions on the preservation of house ownership or the payment of directors of companies assisted by the state.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of other people's irresponsibility, it is not very welcome.
These steps are necessary," he noted on an American television show.
And when John McCaint asked his opponent if he would vote for the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope he would."
"What I have read in a broad line shows that it is something that we all have to digest and by which we can move forward.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, taxpayers would use their money to buy the dubious demands of American financial institutions, something risky and unsellable.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis triggered by the bursting of real estate balloons, leading first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages), and then to other debt (trade) securities, and finally to the freezing of liquid resources and the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was overthrown by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems we've managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty should be secured by the government rather than bought up.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which requires that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a $250 billion instalment would first be paid, followed by a further $100 billion if the president considered it necessary.
The payment of the remaining 350 billion dollars should be approved by Congress by another vote.
In exchange for help, Washington acquires shares in the subsidised companies, which will give it dividends from profits and which can be sold after the crisis has come to an end.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan and may also set a maximum value for wages and severance payments to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drafters of the plan would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives today and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Yesterday, statements against the plan were repeated both among Republicans and Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice," said the Republican Scott Garrett, who is a member of the House's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that favors taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, the Democrat representative in charge of a small congressional group called the "sceptic faction", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize-winning scientists, wrote to us to ask Congress not to hurry up and to look carefully at which path it chooses," said Sherman yesterday.
In Europe, once again, they understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group at EUR 11.2 billion (US USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitors on the verge of bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 million (US$ 2.9 billion) due to the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
Fortis is one of the twenty largest European banks and one of the ten largest insurance companies with 85,000 employees.
"This is not a waste of money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"We'll get the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Manche, the British government seems to be planning to nationalize another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all the ongoing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion ($75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would purchase the subsidiaries and client holdings of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government has wanted to nationalize since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the performance
The eyes of beautiful azures, some say, were their greatest cards, others said they were their greatest weaknesses.
Has the handsome American actor ever gotten rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
Through his shyness, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far removed from the shrewd style of the real great monstrments of the art world.
But what a great career he's made!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer at 83 on Friday at Connecticut's estate, one of the last icons of American cinema.
He had less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him and who for a long time was a rival on the screen. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he studied drama at Yale University and then at Actor's Studio in New York before he exploded into the world of theatre, television and cinema.
In addition to being the leader of civil rights, he was ranked second in 1979 as a racing driver in the 24-hour race in Le Mans. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we'll never know what the downsides of this mysterious, private, dedicated actor's life for his work, who hated the glamour of show business, will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans: in his great roles we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his oeuvre, the seventh American art flashes before us, the cinema is constantly changing for more than fifty years.
In our memory, the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are mixed up in the role of a estranged young man in the Tennessee Williams processing "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990) we can remember him in the form of sensitive Mr. Bridge, who faces his old age with the fact that his marriage failed to fulfill his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone up there" he performed an unforgettable performance in the role of rocky Graziano, a storm-life criminal boxer, which was originally intended for James Dean and taken over after his death, Newman's career as an actor in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Big Bang," which won the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961), he played a bitter, vindictive billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money".
Different times, but it's always the same face: that's who he was.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by a change in ages.
Younger people know him mainly from George Roy Hill's cult film "Ice Breakers" (1977), where he plays Reggie Dunlop, the coach of a hockey team who works in an unconventional way.
His fans could see him in 1994 in "The Big Jump" recorded by the Coen brothers.
The line was closed by Sam Mendes' "The Way of Damnation" in 2003, where he was last seen as an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, luxury, and hypocrisy.
French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not view it as "the living rebuttal of underplay" without any humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always gracious to the handsome Paul Newman, whose roles fell into his lap for a long time.
Yet, he played less often young and successful characters: instead, he formed figures living on the edge of society — neurotic, alcoholic, malignant, or hopeless — whose drift and rebellion he was able to restore with perfect credibility.
As director, he showed a less-known face of Newman: a truly chaste and sensitive man deep in his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation of Canadian writer Margaret Laurence's novel) she drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman, starring Joanne Woodward.
The film "Harry and his son" made in 1984, radiating restraint and sadness, commemorates Scott, his son, who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday, many of Newman's admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old comrade Robert Redford (who played with him in "The Big Bang" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") expressed their sorrow: "His presence made my life and the world better.
Generosity and joy of being: this was the secret of the vibrant personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his criticisms of civil rights, the environment, independent film production and Hollywood's debauchery are clouded.
We have often seen his picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He did it with a bad taste in his mouth, though he thought it was funny at first.
However, the proceeds from such sales were always transferred to its Foundation for Children with Disease.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In a letter to five of his daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father has always and ever since been unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
Politicians and their associates are accused of fraud and other criminal offences, including forgery, which are particularly damaging and continuing and commercial in a criminal organisation.
According to the D.A., the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the execution of the tasks was often confirmed by false invoices.
The state and local government funds, totalling approximately HUF 65 million, have migrated partly to the register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of some individuals.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the funds received were taken up on the basis of cost accounts that were not backed by real performance and that the associations never complied with the undertaking.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, the bill blocks were acquired in the market in Józsefváros, and the circular stamps were produced in Kiskunhala.
For which companies the account was to be produced, it was decided, among other things, on the Balaton-felvidék körút to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look like boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, and the invoices to be submitted for applications by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Ministry and the City Council, among others.
Most of these were recorded by István Lados with his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote the most important accounts for receiving grants.
One of Lados' study trips was a brewery.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, dated 2003 the restaurant provided meals for the 90-person group of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, according to the manager's statement, they would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the invoice to the Foundation for the Better Future - later Together for the Third Millennium - was filled with formal and content errors in the summer of 2002.
A Bed and Breakfast in Badacsonytomaj was only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, yet the bill was for a hundred and thirty guests.
But the imaginative forms fillers were overstated when they also marked Pigal Kft., which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not contain documents for the Better Future and the name of the Oops.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and they showed him bills, he immediately knew it was fake documents.
"The stamp had the name of our business and our tax number in the wrong place."
He added that besides the formal reasons, it was not correct that a hundred people were accommodated according to the bill, because they had 11 rooms in total, which do not have that number of seats.
Plus, the bill was for catering while their restaurant stopped working a long time ago.
The zealous account makers did not check that the Budapest travel agency they were looking for only organizes foreign trips, so they tangled their travel in Hungary as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not match the company's account issue practice.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, VAT was included on the document, even though travel to countries outside the European Union was VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for Better Future, as the company's service was not charged by the indicated 25 % VAT, but 15 % VAT, and the employees of the hotel only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice was handwritten.
In addition, the "exhibitors" have spoiled invoices by the fact that, in the case of a company, road freight was designated as carried out by the prosecution procedure, which the company originally based on investment advice did not carry out.
In addition, due to formalities - inadequate invoice format, non-real stamp - it also emerged that accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner's Point were false.
Just like Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that the accounts were being issued by them.
Forgers did not pay attention, for example, to the fact that the HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was being liquidated at the time (2001) when the Young City Association group ate there, which is why the company's liquidator - as far as we know - denied that he would have issued the paper.
I was made consciously.
Another group of issuers of accounts is those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Chance for Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Third Millennium Foundation for about four million forints.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious invoice.
Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, also cooperated with the Zuschlags, which provided the Better Future Foundation, Atlas Association and Redwood Association in 2003 with invoices for roughly HUF 5 million, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither is the movement of money, because the invoices were turned down afterwards, but the organizations have forgotten to include them in their documents.
The next group of companies issuing the invoice shall be those associated with the defendants.
Therefore, Iván Kubatov was the delivery officer of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest, who is engaged in the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices have been purchased by Cash Investment Kft. in Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian man to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued an invoice on behalf of the Kft. to Atlas, the Oops and the Together Third Regiment Foundation, and took their consideration.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, according to the defendant, because they didn't get a job.
Still, the companies benefited because, at the request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the documents of the company formations, issued invoices on behalf of the companies to associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations 15 invoices, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A. thought that 10% of the bills and the VAT hit Kubatov's grip.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictitious invoices, which were produced for the application of the Commissioner's Point.
The Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a tender in January 2006 to the Association of the Socialist Party, Mihály Táncsics Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the funds were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to reveal this, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found in the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, as they did at the DA's office, are likely to report on the progress of the account making.
Interestingly enough, the prime defendant himself, János Zuschlag, decides to lift the veil about everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his best interest, or whether the socialists made a deal with him for the reimbursement of 50 million forints, and Zusi took the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, for his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, or to arrest him at home, have constantly found deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes that cause much greater harm and do not compensate for it are free to walk or at least to wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their own home, he has no opportunity to do so.
The psychology of overbiding: why are we giving out more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overvalue goods.
The neuro-economic foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been explored by neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people do not want to lose out on a type of competition, such as eBay’s auction, so they pay an overprice.
He was trying to map this "play" neural pattern of research using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group took part in a playful auction, while testing the active brain areas of the test subjects using the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, in which the overbiding of the other party is an essential element, the subcortical complex called striatum was activated intensively when the game was lost.
This brain space plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system in addition to several other functions.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the upsetting of the price can be explained by avoiding the intense reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, financial follow-up was also carried out by the economists of the research group.
In this three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they were to win, they would be rewarded with $15 more money.
The third group, on the other hand, had just received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, members of the group also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that one of them was stressed to win and the other to lose.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team playing "against loss" were willing to bet higher than both the control and the "winner" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any pre-existing economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the phenomena of the auction with the joy of winning and avoiding risks.
Only neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we seek medical attention?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
Hundreds of thousands of people are infected with hepatitis at home, but only 7,000 are treated, which is why patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a collective name for infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
The hepatitis viruses are transmitted in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (intoxication, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travelers should be advised to defend themselves against virus A and B by vaccination, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal discomfort and nausea.
Thereafter, jaundice on the skin and whites of the eyes develops, the stools become light, the urine becomes dark, healing may take two to three weeks.
One million people around the world die of more severe types of disease, hepatitis B liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients receives medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and cancer of the liver.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms are only 20 to 30 years from now.
Thus, early prevention, regular screening, is very important afterwards.
In three groups, this disease is well above average: between people undergoing blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently 200 million chronic hepatitis C virus infected in the world.
Since the disease may be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended that you contact your family doctor if you experience any symptoms of unknown cause.
In time, recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thereby eliminating the infectivity and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30th is the World Day for Hepatitis, first organized in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of analgesic that could have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects people's sense of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
In a rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked while all of them were studying a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for controlling pain.
The investigation is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university participate alongside academics.
The investigation was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkling device to the left hand of the test subject, which provided the electroshock.
Researchers asked participants to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci's Lady Hermeline painted in the 15th century.
The investigators hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would cause a religious state among the believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was thought to be soothing.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which they received 20 electroshocks in four successive episodes while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
The Catholics reported that they felt "safe" in the sight of the Virgin Mary, like they were "careful" and "rested, filled with peace".
While watching the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo’s creation was seen before.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find an image that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases changes our personality," said Wright.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a painter of the same calibre were to show a picture of a madonna to the believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would the sight of a quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: it is in people's pockets as much as it is above their heads in the sky; he knows where they vacationed, what specialties they go to and what interests them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top executives.
As for the skeptics that parallel the Orwellian horrendous image, they can't see exactly the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect more personal data about its users, and this is necessary in order for them to be able to stick to the original goal of Google founders, which was to "regulate all the information in the world".
According to the Google leader, after ten years of subversive work, the company is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
The question of what will happen in five years' time, Schmidt replied: do you want Google to be able to answer questions such as "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would really suit me?" - but until then, the software can't answer such simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact location of the queries when searching the Internet, the IP address they were looking for and the page to which they went after the search.
With the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and thus generate much more personalised hits for them in the long run - based on the same logic, Recommendations will offer us products and services based on our previously stated and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me, if they look at it, what do I do? - asked users who are worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the amount of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power, causing counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but may also be handed over to third parties in justified cases, in such legal cases there is no protection of the privacy of Internet users.
Perhaps the loudest example of this has been the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on pedophiles from its community site Orkut.
However, Internet users concerned about privacy could sigh in May when the company, in cooperation with the EFF's electronic rights protection organization, successfully proved its case in court against the FBI: Google cannot be forced to supply any information requested in secret by the FBI at any point in the Constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully managed to extract some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which were obtained by reference to the ratification of the Child Protection Act adopted years ago, but failed to obtain the search lists of unique users, and to obtain a full list of two months of websites and keywords.)
Thus, Google's judgment is quite controversial: it is being flogged by those who are afraid to give their personal data because they feel that their privacy and privacy are frustrating by starting to use Google's services and acting against them with rebellion for multi-companies in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its wild drive of enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users in many countries see the next generation of large companies, the "hot corporation" in them, unlike its rival Microsoft, the world conqueror of Windows, no matter how much both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google does not ask users for an identification code in a way other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly kept fresh source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant practice.
However, it can also happen that the geeks have an accurate understanding of the very problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet, which has been underlined by the web 2.0, one of the most frequently spoken keywords of recent years.
The web 2.0 is about collaboration, deliberately leaving clues and using the communication channels at our disposal, and while they vary from person to person, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can create a profile from Facebook to Xang on several social media sites, connect them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing his music habits, and then connect them all to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also to blogs that automatically display their latest photo galleries on Flickr or Picasa.
While there are a number of exemplary cases from which the girlfriend can be seen: seeing the morning photo stream of the common circle of friends, she can find out who her cheating friend spent the night with or fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion about senior management in her blog: one thing is certain that the concept of privacy is completely appreciated by now.
Living an online life is about what it shows itself, which is the basic principle behind the behavior of young people today.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google Monopoly, can do so (for example, starting with Scroogle using Google's search engine, but not leaving a trace on purpose).
For example, the number of people who deliberately don't register on social networks so that they can't be found can be replaced by alternative versions from the word editor to the image manager and the news reader, which do not connect to huge server parks and which do not compile the best profile that we have ever had.
The public doesn't expect it to be so secret when Google shows its true colors.
With its current value of 156 billion dollars, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($ 124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services introduced at an ever-increasing pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, the critics find the unsettling counterpoints: the senior management, for example, completely rejected the protests of the employees after increasing the company's kindergarten fee to double, found it too costly to eat employees at any number of times a day, but they are all dwarfed by the fact that Google turned its back on the Chinese government in 2006 and that according to their agreement, the company will filter out any hits that violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they do not advertise a new service unless it is already in use, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is so large that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others fear Health's system, in which we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide the next generation of sci-fi writers with a good raw material, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled Point Orwellian, describes the future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly from Google data.
Two underages helped the Oddian double killer to get a trace.
Two juveniles were interrogated by the police in the case of the Ozdi double murder, and there was a reasonable suspicion that they were helping to cover up the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Headquarters on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the crime at their expense, and are currently being charged with aiding and abetting.
The two minors - according to the information of the MTI, two girls - are defending themselves at large.
Abetting is punishable by imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect of the Osdi double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
He's been charged with premeditated, profit-seeking, multiple homicides.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed more money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to an Osdi site last Wednesday, where he killed him and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, a sign of which is that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapon and the conditions of its use will be investigated by the police with the assistance of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange bid to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech koruna - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of the 100 percent stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Stock Exchange in Warsaw, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state control.
Ninety-nine percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers within a few months.
The Czech Economic Daily E15 is new to know that the Polish bid represents the highest amount, which so far has been offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of interest, and did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague stock exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders' agreement, some 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25% stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
From the perspective of European newspapers on the financial crisis
The European papers leading on Tuesday's comments to the deepening international financial crisis already mention "the second 11 September".
We owe the global financial disaster to the US President - accused by the Roman La Repubblica - the President was not even able to line up his own party behind a bill that was in a hurry to make up for the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it's more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
In El Mundo’s view, the lack of political leadership there brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the American financial system collapsing is growing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but following the Congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest changes in capitalism's history takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points out the Tags-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Today, some states can still provide a lifeline for the supporting financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino cubes, neither the funds nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and centralise control of the fragmented financial markets.
More than EUR 100 billion has been allocated to infirm financial institutions only on Monday, recalls the Der Standard in Vienna, which states that the concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, have to go deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis are increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
"Savers" do not have to flash hundreds of billion euros soon, but it would be good to record that it is reasonable to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
A bumblebee's flight is simulated by an intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision if not to imitate barrier sensors in the world of nature?
Like bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo university, Nissan built the BR23C bio-imitating auto-robot management system, a robotized mini-car that was endowed with bees' properties, with the ultimate aim of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, each bee creates its oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety cover, explained Kazuhhiro Doi, trade director of technology PR and R & D at the exhibition.
The role of the complex eye of the uterus is important, which can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers reached out to the idea of laser telemetry.
This identifies obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts into an action to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second, the obstacle is detected, then the car robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, changes direction immediately by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In a way other than any current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If this were not the case, the auto robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of Mobility Laboratory and the auto-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety cover, a layer within which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
However, in a way other than bees, the deviation must not be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it must be only two-dimensional, and only towards the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available for bees to avoid other bees, only rotating movement and acceleration and slowing down were used as the available option for the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have higher energy density, which means they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
Andoh believes that an instinctive intelligent response is the important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This device only has to process and respond to a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so they use only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There is no need for gigabytes or megabytes of memories.
This is the first step towards the development of instant bypass technology, which Nissan estimates will be able to enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
A further possibility of application may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
There's a name for the expensive kid.
A written version of the $700 billion Economic Rescue Package Act, which is applicable in several instalments to buy bad loans from banks, has been prepared.
First round, they spend half the money.
During further discussions until after midnight on the east coast time, congressional leaders were able to settle in the days-long debate around a total of $700 billion rescue package, reported Reuters.
We have made serious progress, said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the House of Representatives, who says that the agreement is all we have left to put on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Commenting on the outcome of the compromise, Finance Minister Henry Paulson stated that the programme will work and be effective, but further work is needed. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, it is about turning the cart around the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 p.m. on Sunday evening (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m. CET), but did not cause a spectacular boom in the fairs.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the draft legislation to be named in the 2008 Act on Economic Emergency Stabilization, which will take place in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
Moreover, the programme differs from the initial proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have meant that the $700 billion would have been spent one-on-one on the purchase of poor quality credit-backed securities.
Now, in the first round, a maximum of half of the 700 billion can be spent by using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance buys loan-backed, bad-rated securities, and the fate of an additional 100 billion dollars depends on the President's decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
Spending the other half of the 700 billion will depend on a new resolution from Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use combined tactics: it can buy both bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place in the framework of auctions and directly - said the Ministry.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial portfolio guarantees the assets of concern for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to reach the urgent needs of the US financial system, up to $700 billion, whether it is a widespread purchase of bad assets, whether they are insured or the risk of systemic collapse of a large financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the bosses of banks in distress and waiting for state help can expect their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute, to be limited by the government.
Payments are limited only in certain cases and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys in an auction, an extra tax will be levied on the golden parachute, unless they retire the devolved bank manager.
In direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not exaggerated.
This includes the fact that existing golden parachute contracts do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - commented the chairman of the House's Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire a holding, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can ultimately win the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank saved with it recovers.
The draft law states that over the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were some who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what American citizens have asked us to do, which means it does not protect taxpayers' dollars, said the Republican MP Darrell Issa of California.
Ohio’s Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believed that the measures were advocated by the same people responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12.9 percent in August 2007, reports KSH.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 percent higher compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to one year earlier.
As a result of the domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 percent higher than the previous month and 3.2 percent higher than the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum of 0,1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The highest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a 4.6 per cent increase in the production of bags and straps and a 2.5 per cent increase in the monthly production of footwear.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical inputs have resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing (1.4 per cent), in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent) and, to a minimum, in the wood processing (0.1 per cent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured a price increase between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In August, prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector with a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry increased by 0.3 percent, mainly due to the pervasive effect of the regulatory gas price increase from 1 July.
Twelve months in comparison - domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors - the highest increase in prices in the oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking industry, an 11 percent increase in prices was observed in the food, beverage and tobacco production sector, with a dominant weight.
Price reductions occurred in textiles, textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 and 9.1%.
Prices have increased by 10.2 percent in the manufacturing industry as a whole over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7% higher than the ones one year earlier.
Domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in August in the sectors producing capital goods.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3%, and in the energy and downstream sectors, prices have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in energy and downstream sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured a 6,8 percent increase in prices and a 1.4 percent decrease in prices for capital goods.
Export sales prices of the industry, measured in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, and decreased by 3.9 percent in comparison to 12 months.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro and 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, by 7.5 percent compared to the euro in August 2007 and 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "it is now almost all depends on whether the electronic access or control system is being developed in time across the sea".
However, he pointed out that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register before departure.
From today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy will negotiate in Washington.
He meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary honors the Star and talks with the foreign policy advisers of Barack Obama's Democratic Party and John McCain's Republican presidential candidate.
The bank rescue package is supported by Barack Obama and McCain
Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidential candidates of the two great American parties, supported the government's $700 billion bailout package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
After days of marathon talks with congress and administration representatives, it was announced on Sunday at dawn that they had agreed on a bail-out package in principle.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to thaw the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain claim to be more suitable than their rival to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, once economic issues were brought to the fore, Obama once again gained some advantage, melted McCain's advantage, which he gained after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
On Sunday at a campaign meeting in Detroit, Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection passages that he supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility..." he said in front of the 35 grand crowd, "and threaten your position, your savings, the entire industries, the stability of the whole economy."
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in his interview with ABC, "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing this (...) but doing nothing is simply not an option."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the setting up of a board for the Minister of Finance and limiting the severance pay for top executives, and he insisted on it.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the Minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
Page survey of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the voters became more self-conscious – so Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red-Black coalition.
Der Spiegel.de
In the online edition of the German newsmagazine on the left, Franz Walter, Bavaria's revolution devours its birth fathers, analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the whole Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party has ceased.
The CSU landed at 47.7 percent ten years ago in 1998, for the first time since the 1950s, below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the systematic modernisation implemented by CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the pace they have been very wrong. However, it could not have been without consequences for the voters' loyalty to CSU by secularization, educational results, the integration of East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can be seen.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the electorate became more self-conscious, more critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups were the most distant from the CSU; they were freelance workers, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
The CSU's support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily article "Who, with whom? Party presidents on moderate coalition issues" deals with the confusing domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The election was made, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the party leaders hardly allowed any insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed his intention to negotiate with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in social partnership.
The question of whether you could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - the current ÖVP president as Vice Chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case voted down.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded with caution to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
The fact that his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still completely open to the party, issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red-Black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Walker: Break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit started today in Paris, where France, representing the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union, hosted this year.
Lívia Járóka, Fideszwoman of the European People's Party, addressed education segregation in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, because it is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacles to their implementation.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, Roma are mainly excluded from the labour market because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths have no secondary education, and only a small proportion of them can obtain higher education due to poor quality primary education".
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the congresswoman, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relationships in the broadest range, including among Roma and non-Roma.
Because the sooner the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market increase; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"Romas must have the right to quality education by virtue of their citizenship of the European Union and must be guaranteed the elimination of their low quality and separate education", said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, it is essential to bring together the European Union's goal and action-oriented cooperation in order to speed up the desegregation processes at school immediately, with proper enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directives being essential.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities of democratic space so that they can contribute to Europe's future as full citizens", said Járóka.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which took place annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the outgoing Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided
Despite the ugly electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, the Bajor CSU's peaks have for the time being postponed the discussion of personal questions.
Party President Erwin Huber and Provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still remain in place, asking how long the grace will last.
The fate of the tandem suffering from 17 percent catastrophic loss of votes will be decided by an extraordinary party convention on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized couple showed that they did not stick to their chairs with all their strength.
They used it to appease the angry members of the faction and base, who claimed personal restraints one day after the "Bazaror tsunami" due to the loss of an absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only 43.4 percent of its power.
For 46 years the CSU has been a single ruler in Bavaria with 18 percent of German GDP.
Even though conservatives remain highly important for the Hungarian economy in a key southern region, they will in any case be forced to coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is a potential successor to Huber, who will also be included in a narrow reconnaissance team that will start soft-talking negotiations with liberal FDP and free electorate along the right-wing values on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing is that the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by the Huber-Beckstein pair as a coup opportunity, will be included in the legislation on the list of Free Voters and then brutally dealt with the ambitious self-government politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also play an active role in calling 28 September the most bitter day of the political career of the former Provincial Prime Minister and former CSU President, Stoiber, who has been working on the threads from behind.
On Monday, Huber made a few epic remarks to the CDU, saying they deserved much more support from the brothers and sisters.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag election due in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, is not somehow put back on its feet.
According to Merkel, who is hard to hide his disappointment about the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's soil will not negatively affect the Berlin Grand Coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of social democrats will last longer.
The SPD has achieved its weakest result in Bavaria by 18.6 percent since 1946.
Lukashenko’s antagonism: 110-0
No opposition member has entered the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) it can be explained by the lawlessness committed during the count of votes.
The OSCE sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the 10 million country's 100 - ten - person legislation lacked the opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, united as the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), seriously hoped that, following the constitutional amendment, Lukashenko, which renewed his presidential mandate for the contested elections in 2006, "allowed" some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament for the fourth time.
The ODSZ therefore also stopped the previously considered boycott.
The background of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has taken credit for the reduction of Russian gas imports that are constantly increasing, and has also contributed to the Russian handing over Beltransgaz, which has been passing through the country, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, to which Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry permits because of the political set-up in Belarus, which has been classified as anti-democratic.
It was a preliminary relief that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused on positive shifts rather than on shortcomings, such as the banning of a third of opposition candidates from departure.
However, the OSCE's rapid report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present in the count of votes.
Nevertheless, according to the opposition, there is a tangible improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state, has considered the two territories independent for a month now.
- We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun, said Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remain, despite the fact that "the power was afraid to let even one opposition into the weightless parliament".
The opposition does not intend to take any protests in view of the results, but rather tries to convey its message of the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are creating barriers to distribution, but I still see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly, Milinkevich said, referring to Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be his main achievement, even the officially most supported pensioners do not consider it appropriate.
- Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the trade deficit, it is a matter of time for the breakdown of social security "revoking the silence of the cemetery", said Milinkevich.
As opposed to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi that "people believe not words but actions", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of Chigi Palace, rotating doors have been installed for the entry and exit of workers.
From this day on, this new measure against the craftsmen will come into effect, to detect those who block and then go out for coffee during work hours.
Today Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office presented the anti-slip news.
"The rotating gates, Brunetta said, are for better and more efficient work, for reducing absenteeism and for increasing services"
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," said Brunetta.
With the Chigi Palace, all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
Masi says "the installation of rotary gates is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general confirmed: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
In short, breakfast is over on the job, no more coffee, no more brioche.
Brunetta smiles and advises: "A good cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning can perform miracles."
At the College of Public Administration in Rome
At a meeting held in Brussels, the Minister explained that "in three months, public sector workers' absences due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means 60 000 more people in one year".
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more effective.
"which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and has far exceeded the inflation rate".
At the same time, thousands of public servants gathered, joining the submission supported by the Association of Italian Environmental and Consumer Protection Associations to protest against the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Public Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of the absences due to the disease, the 'inexhaustible slackers' war continues to grow," says the Consumer Association.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate regulations of the decree."
The regional administrative court is under attack, inter alia, on the abolition of supplementary sickness benefit due to reasons of service, the extension of the stay of sick workers at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects included in the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, of which 3 end with death and 27 end with permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company at work, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and it is killing almost twice as much as killing.
Today, Anmil organizes the 58th day of the victims of accidents at work traditionally held in Italy on second Sunday October to draw the attention of the institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, show that prevention plays an extremely important role in accidents at work," said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, President of the National Association for Accidents at Work.
The Head of State sincerely commended the "persistent commitment of the Union to prevention at work, the protection of the interests of workers who have suffered accidents, the help of family members of victims and the receptiveness of public opinion".
"T tragedies of this nature, which, by reason of their size, attract media and public interest, cause an outcry, which is naturally shared by everyone, but in reality, we have to face dramatic, repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are without doubt in a lack of resources, the financing of education and information is crucial.
In-school initiatives aimed at direct education for young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to let the social importance of this issue become less noticeable, and we need more effective legislation that needs to be put into effect.
For its part, Gianfranco Fini, president of the Lower House, stressed that "the serious social significance of the accidents at work that have resulted in death is borne by the conscience of all of us, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"However, we do not want this downward trend to be accompanied by a decreasing focus, because the greatest tragedies occur when attention is reduced."
"We believe that at the general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome this phenomenon through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, we need more stringent supervision and control - stressed Mercandelli - and a stronger intervention in the field of labour education, starting from school education."
"More efforts are also needed to inform and make public opinion aware," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employers' environment against a phenomenon that poses a social problem".
Then Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for victims of accidents at work" and "the direction of assistance towards which the system has been drifting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to return to the workers the safety afforded by insurance, because the fate of those who suffer accidents cannot depend on the arbitrary actions of the legislators and on handouts".
Mp3 players may cause hearing loss
Listening to portable recording devices at longer and high volume, such as MP3 devices, can cause permanent hearing loss -
published in Brussels on the basis of an opinion published today by the European Commission, the EU Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"It turns out that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player with a high volume for more than one hour per day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss," he explains.
"It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones in mass and often are not aware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk, which we urgently need to respond to," added the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and to disseminate information about them widely.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function effectively and keep pace with the latest technologies".
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise pollution caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine possible measures to protect children and minors exposed to noise pollution caused by portable players and similar devices," the Committee finally said.
The current European safety standard sets the maximum noise levels for portable music players at 100 dB; however, there is growing concern about hearing loss data resulting from the excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions, such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution, which can significantly reduce these hearing loss.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee explains that for people using portable recording devices who listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum noise at work.
If a person listens to music in similar circumstances for a longer period of time, there is a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This affects about 5-10 percent of people who use portable devices, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno, sets up the Committee for the Future of the Capital
It starts today, it lasts until March, the results are expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Metropolitan Government for the operation of the Committee "The Future of the Roman Capital", which met this morning at the new seat behind Caracalla's baths.
Over the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 committee members will draw up Rome's guidelines.
Following the conclusion of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general meeting and in the municipal committee in order to submit in June the capital strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and the Mayor of Gianni Alemanno.
"This is a completely independent committee in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - emphasises Alemanno - to draw up proposals for Rome's development ideas on which political decision-makers, the Assembly and the Committee of Local Government, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans for the benefit of Rome can be made.
In March, after he has completed his work, the committee will be disbanded because he has a fixed term of office.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the seat capital of Rome, the Mayor said.
For those who consider the Commission's operation unnecessary, referring to the fact that its opinion is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality of proposals it will put on the table.
If the standards prove to be adequate, as in France for the Attali Committee, which I take for granted in the case of Rome, its contribution will play an important role.
The power of politics is often fragmented in day-to-day affairs and in the management of urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account perspectives, look further and plan for the longer term and are committed to working for Rome's development and future".
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless "waterhead" because it is absolutely free, it will not cost any euro to the citizens of Rome, but it is an inspiration for thought and aims to involve the finest minds in the capital".
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump to the standard that it needs so much, thinking about its future in a united spirit".
Regarding the future on which the mayor of Rome emphasises: "it will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but it will look much further away", we see not only the future metropolis and the status of the capital city, but also "the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can and must play".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, in his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had close relations (as he does today as a private person) with enemy Islam".
As the election time approaches, the attacks on Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady on the Internet said, "This man is full of ambitions.
Obama insolently believes that he can gain the highest public-law dignity of a nation of which so far two governors and five senators have been black!"
These attacks are actually meaningless; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether they will be a good president, and then here are the polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant priority.
Even in this case, there are those who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
Inside the southern states, a newspaper in Mississippi wrote in its editorial: we know well that the real American patriot casts his vote for whom in the voting pod.
A side of American thinking appears here that has remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the iks on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
These words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this reasoning, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush.
You asked 1,500 people about the mistakes they made during Bush's term of office?
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it was so banged up that it flew home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Yet the majority believe that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
There's a huge task ahead for the man who replaces George W.
USA: the economic collapse is felt by journalists, and the time has come for cuts in the newsrooms. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future situation and intellectual power of their profession.
Well, at present, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their own future.
However, they did not make it clear that their concern about authenticity had been reduced.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money.
According to them, the 2008 crisis is the failure of a powerless economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, or newspaper editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism to be reduced to a minimum in the sense that the general public understands, this problem must be solved, says the journalists asked.
Today, there is a clear and complex pessimism in American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top leaders working in the printed press are convinced that national tourism is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management positions.
It's printed versus electronic press.
Press staff have no difficulty seeing where the World Wide Web is going.
The biggest publishers are breaking their way to the Internet, which many say is the "murderer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they were voting for the technology in the hope that it might benefit from tourism.
Today, there is a gap between editorial leaders in the American press department, i.e. directors, and correspondents working for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are confident that their correspondents will share their information with others, while at local level this ratio is only 23 percent.
Some people associate this with a secure job.
At national level, 47 percent of the leaders fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this percentage is 30%.
In America, the question of "secure work" is constantly on the agenda at team level (for our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation such as the United States with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a "need or not" basis.
Directors usually get high salaries and editors can make $10,000 a month, in addition to paying pensions and health insurance.
Freedom, on the other hand, works on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, in the third year also, until after a certain time it reaches a maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
It all depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROMANIC COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Division of the Court of Rome, rejected Danilo Coppola’s application for a residence in the real estate sector from Grottaferrata to a Roman flat.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings initiated against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban for Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate professional be allowed to visit his capital apartment from the small town in the country.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has proposed to reject them) would allow it to influence the company's affairs and to have access to the evidence against it.
The Elite Is In Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: a significant part of Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has led to a break in the Republican Party, which is increasingly divisive between the traditional, restrained East Coast attitudes supporting federal institutions and business circles and the ever-increasing new anti-D.C. and financial trends in the Middle and Southern States.
This line was critically manifested in the vote in the House referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic restructuring still taking place predicts or permits to be seen, not only in the United States, but also throughout the Western world, perhaps even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is speeding up the phenomenon that has been laying low for a long time and which is solidified in this new atmosphere and is finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-updating, bringing back the dual category of state sovereignty into the public consciousness, in connection with a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is affecting banking and financial institutions which, although having a close relationship with the rest of the world, are, first and foremost, and quite widely, bringing people and families with them that live in a single country, in a single state.
This, on the other hand, is a direct political problem for those on the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also electorate.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially stranded outside the coastline: the European Union is an excellent proof of this, which cannot set a single policy stance, inter alia, between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but above all the opening up of funds: because only individual states have economic resources, a financial set that can make things right.
They also have the means and the authority to use them: in certain circumstances, they have two invaluable sources which no other market or international organisation will likely ever have.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation state is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future depended on things that were increasingly, least not abstract, like water, crop and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, yet are entirely linked to a demarcated location, an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more cards than who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
Which brings me to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Anyone who says it's territory, state, government, necessarily says it's politics, in other words, leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to be producing two converging phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can take control of events.
On the other hand, it brings complete credit losses from current management, especially economic leaders, who have proved to be completely inadequate and have proven that they still have a lot of obscure areas ahead of them.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of credit loss, impatience, inadequacy and dissociation, affecting the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the belief that the time of the highest social elite has passed has spread among the wider population. It expired before their actions, experiences, lifestyles, cultures, in the complex sense of the word, became their own. This makes the social elite increasingly alienated from the majority’s opinions.
In short, the need for leadership, in a veiled form, feeds a diverse but strong delegitimation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is not expected in the "rebellions" of the voters, or in recent times in the sudden changes of the public mood. For example, the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party Unit in Great Britain, or the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right side).
It seems that the traditional elite, along with their parties, programs, and even their customs, press and renowned intellectuals, are becoming less and less understood and therefore less able to represent what has been going on for some time in the deeper parts of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is intensifying, spreading and potentially able to generate an ever greater degree of anger.
Nevertheless, speaking of "the imminent rebellion of the masses" is, frankly, an exaggeration.
But keeping your eyes open doesn't hurt at all.
We can use super-strong glue on the wall.
By using a super-strong glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This is the goal set by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to finding a solution.
With an adhesive piece of just 2.5 square centimetres, researchers managed to tape and hold a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
THE American journal STUDY - Science published the findings of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the development of special carbon nanotube materials already in existence.
"The principle of glue must be conceived as a package of spaghetti-like pipe systems," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew the idea from the feet of the gecko covered with microscopic folds, which provides perfect grip for the animal.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, Teflon and abrasive paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the soles of the reptiles mentioned, but at the same time "it is easily separated from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton Faculty of Engineering.
"This material can be useful as temporary glue," adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think more about a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes drive heat and electricity well.
You can also find additional applications for space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University of California is also experimenting with a new glue.
According to the article published in the American Chemical Society, California scholars presented a hairlike microfibrous adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface and thus always provides perfect grip.
Don't use juice.
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin, especially in the summer, thirsty drinks, when taken together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or reducing their effects, as appropriate, may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, drew attention to the risks of co-administration of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The professor announced at the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving medicines, thus preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice had already been placed on the defendants' bench when it was found to be able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rhythm control and neuropharmaceuticals to levels considered toxic.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice contain substances that interfere with the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are inhibited by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the University of Milan, draws attention to: "In general, such discoveries are immediately indicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes, who, if necessary, ensure that they change the information contained in the prospectus of the given product.
That is why you should always read the information on the medicine you are going to take, and if something is not understandable, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask your doctor or pharmacist clearly," said Ansa.
Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize for Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics for the analysis of the territorial context of trade models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old neokensian Krugman teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman in his editorial published in the New York Times predicted that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast has aroused a lot of debate and has been repeatedly addressed by economists, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked at how quickly the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom has gone beyond public interest," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "rept value economist" while at the same time spreading his criticism of the Bush government's excessive liberalism in a rather aggressive manner."
Open Office, worth the third edition of the "Microsoft Anti-Microsoft" package
OpenOffice.org 3.0 is published today, an open program-coded application package that aims at more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from liberal professions to public administration.
After almost a year of work supervised by the SUN Microsystem and carried out by voluntary developers, the new Open Office comes to the public with a number of new features: in addition to the welcome screen and the rethought, less Spartan user interface, it offers several important novelties, such as compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operational system, and supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can open Microsoft documents with a new extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interestingly, the specific function of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This can be useful in sending files by email. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a graphics module, keeping the site layout.
On the same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting of each other's work. Each staff member's comment is marked in different colors, which helps to make it easier to identify during the inspection phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice's features available from the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from the following address after being posted on the mirror pages since Friday: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
On request, we can take over the installation CD at home or at work.
Freeness is probably the most attractive for the take-up of the home application, but the Open Office package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of educational, advisory and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant word editor; Calc, Table Manager for Excel Replacement; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is similar to the most well-known Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The aim of 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, considering that with the new version we are already at 3.600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth doping case.
One of the participants, Bernhard Kohl, who competes in the Gerolsteiner team's colours, has once again produced a positive pattern in the last section of the Tour de France, who won the best mountain-leading T-shirt in addition to the bronze medal.
The news came out on the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth contestant, Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol in Italy, as well as the German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who tested positive in the Cera test considered the third generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood sample has been tested by labs in Lausanne and chatenay-malabry, as in recent weeks.
If the control tests also confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian loses his third place and, according to the regulations, is banned from racing for two years.
The news on the positive results of Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, Head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and announced to the Associated Press news agency that it had reported positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, as well as the best dot shirt.
INJURY: THE NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKING A QUESTION, ITALY RASSIST?
Italy has only recently changed from an immigrant country to one of the preferred targets of reluctant immigrants.
That is why the "Belpaese" is transforming into a racist nation? This question is raised by the New York Times, which, based on the case of young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case is well described by what the New York Times calls the "north paradox": in the northern regions, the "strongest integration and highest employment" is at the same time the "anti-immigrantism and support for the Northern League" is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would strengthen the control of immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of the change of mood in Italy.
This trend is highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church work together to combat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rents, it can cost up to 900 euros a room
The market for accommodation for students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the Union of Housing Owners, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such amazing proportions that, due to the high overall costs to families, it is blocking a wide range of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. "The high demand from students in these cities has distorted the market to such an extent that a general price increase has also started for local residents."
In most cases real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: unregistered contracts with no rental restrictions, with associated sublets.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be needed to maximise prices by reviewing the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, 450 Euros are requested for a bed; the price of the single room ranges from 650 Euros (Bande Nere area) to 800 Euros (Lambia, Udine and Fiera) on average, but it can reach 900 Euros (Vittoria area).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed space is 350/400 euros, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where most of the students live in a neighborhood close to the university, a bed cost 250/280 euros for double and 370-500 euros for single rooms.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single bed and 450 for a double bed.
The prices are slightly cheaper (550 euros per single room) around other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs you can save a bit: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros for a bed, from 400 to 600 euros for a room, the price is highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, one bed is paid 250/350 EUR and at least 350 EUR for one single room.
Prices in smaller cities are lower in absolute terms, but represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students from outside the EU often look for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old cinema halls is over in the cities
Traditional cinemas close for Multiplexes.
"A city with no movies, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore show effectively what is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
Extinguishing cinemas - the appearance of large, multi-term cinemas in the suburbs, and consequently the decay of single-term cinemas in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places disappear, "it's like a friend leaving, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. Twenty years ago, the film, which represented the Oscar Award and the Grand Prize of the Cannes Festival, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, the longing after a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The data provided by Anec, the largest association of operators, is clear: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have closed down. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is at the forefront of the most affected regions, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that the expansion of multiplexes is precisely the same as the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions of Italy: in the last five years, the number of halls has increased by 195 in Lombardy, 81 in Tuscany and the same amount in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says the President of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is okay to build new facilities, but the survival of the already existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city cinema closes, not all the goers are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention uncharged financial funds to support operators: the state's overdue debt is estimated at around EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market, EUR 16-18 million a year would be needed".
This is the first Italian city that, in its concern over closures, has decided to remedy the problem in order to protect and boost single-room cinemas in both the city and downtown, through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and the benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park at a reduced tariff in certain parking spaces.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas need to improve sound and image quality in order to be able to cope with multiplexes, because today's audience is much more demanding.
Protecting traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that eventually made Cinema Paradiso, although I had been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the Via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale so I don't see the posters blacked out by the dust, I turn my head.
Close ties between politics and the 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Pyromall clan in municipal decisions".
Serious accusations were made by the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, as well as the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external involvement in criminal networks.
Gioacchino Piromalli, senior broker between the clan and the administration, and nephew of a lawyer with the same name as the chief, who had previously been convicted of involvement in a mafia-like crime syndicate, has been indicted for EUR 10 million.
"The disregard for all legal and moral rules, what is more, for good taste", writes the state's attorneys. The two local governments declared their intention to pay counsel to Piromalli lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially had access to city hall, which would have given us further opportunity to control and control the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not hide the fact that there is "a number of collusion between the local institutions and the organised underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'andrangheta', they are the heroes who remain clean".
The arrests this morning are the continuations of July's events, when the police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Pyromall clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to administer the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991 because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat mayor at the time of dissolution, took the lead in the second round in 2006.
He cried a scandal when the County Hall ordered the local government commission to be dissolved.
He brought Marco Minnini to justice and accused him of planning everything with a political purpose. However, in the arrest order signed this morning, the court stated that the Pyromall clan had gone so far as to demand a change in project A3.
From the wiretap ordered against Dal Torrione, the state's attorneys say, "it was desirable to meet the demands of an extensive contractor representing a group known to be close to the Piromall family, to subjugate the decisions of the municipality to the clan interest."
The energy is coming from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface and is still being discovered by large international energy companies
Waves, sea currents, tidal tides, all renewable energy sources, which have been seen by giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on.
For a hundred years, they have been looking for ways to extract energy from the sea's movements.
Around 1980, when oil prices fell, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices are giving the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council in London (WEC) estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by facilities for the use of waves of the seas.
This quantity is twice as much as what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would still be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant to be set up in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed since then, and more and more companies are opting for marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and is considering cooperation with us," said Wall Street Journal, a spokesman for an associate of the American oil giant.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a licence issued by the US Energy Commission for the launch of the Alaskan offshore energy project.
This is not of little importance, especially considering that the US is in the process of extracting oil in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey are also on the road to extractable energy from the sea.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, it is still primitive technology, even because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
Existing installations such as Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not pose a major problem with the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce more energy on a larger scale, we need facilities with a more significant environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses an interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving the buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure's turning a turbine, and it's fueling a generator.
Electricity travels to the mainland on cables under the sea.
For now, there are four similar facilities at the design stage that are just waiting for a federal permit, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started energy production for a shopping centre and a parking lot with the help of six submarine turbines located in the East River Strait in New York.
At tidal tides, the movement of water turns the blades of the turbines, and this rotating motion feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that it had a long list of partners who were just waiting for permits to use energy.
It's a tidal wave.
At present, the opportunities that can be exploited through tidal tides deserve special attention.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tidal tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be considered a more reliable energy source.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent 7.5 million dollars in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the tide, which is expected to rise to 35 million in 2009.
