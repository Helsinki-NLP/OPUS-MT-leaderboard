Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Speedy inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The price increase in November was higher than expected in 13 countries of the euro area, with 3.1 percent annual inflation recorded after 2.6 percent in October, reported the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the EU.
The official forecast was only three percent likely, said Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the base rate by saying that the reduction would lead to an inflationary spiral along with rising commodity prices and easing unemployment.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but close to, two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is trapped in the trap of twenty-two: "discuss" inflation so that it does not have to act on this subject later.
In Germany, the figure of 3.3 percent of November inflation is a 12-year record; in Spain, it increased from 3.1 to 3.6.
Eurozone inflation has been boosted by high food and energy prices.
Future wheat quotations have risen by 88 percent and soybean prices have reached the highest since 1973.
Food oil and dairy products also had to pay significantly more in 2007.
Oil prices on the world market increased by 52 percent this year, and last month, almost $100 a barrel of black gold cost.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase from 2.1 to 2.5% this year in 2008, but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12 month inflation rate remains at around 3 per cent in the next 3-4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to double-rate interest during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a long stagnation, Fidesz's support group increased significantly to early December, so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while Gallup has not previously measured such a low 13% socialist support.
In the case of certain party electorates, the difference would be more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support against the one-fifth (20 percent) support of the MSZP, due to the greater determination of opposition voters.
According to the survey, MDF and SDSZ are below the parliamentary threshold: their support within the overall population is two per cent.
Among the secure voters, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic climate has deteriorated even further to the previous low - there has never been such a high percentage, 41 percent of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly bad, while another 46 percent think it is rather bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their financial situation after spring and summer prospects.
For the following year, the greater half of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than every previous Gallup survey, 71 percent of respondents considered that the Prime Minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
In Ferenc Gyurcsány 13 percent of the respondents are confident or very confident, while Viktor Orbán has a 38 percent share of supporters.
54 percent don't trust the Prime Minister at all, 27 percent trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of society believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be tackled without a change of government.
While after last October's riots, 35 percent of the government and the Prime Minister wanted to remain, at the moment this ratio is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution to the new elections.
The interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of the respondents answer the question asking for participation, saying that they would definitely leave, and another 20 percent say that they would probably leave.
As a comparison, only 55 percent would take part in a parliamentary election to be held this Sunday and another 15 percent would consider it likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be questionable on the basis of the current intentions.
For tuition fees, 74 percent of the people, 79 percent of the people, and 84 percent of the hospital's per diem would say no.
If we look at the same rates only among those promising to participate in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, visits and hospital allowances.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco raised nearly a fifth
In the trade triangle in Budaörs, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 percent last year, with the difference that VAT did not rise this year.
Article of the Daily Economy
The usual Christmas basket of the Day increased by 16 percent in the trade triangle of Budaörs again this year, but in each hypermarket there was an increase of well above a thousand forints.
Since last December prices in supermarkets were "discontinued" so that, compared to the former high base, there was no drastic price increase.
However, it is clearly frightening for consumers that what they could have received under nine thousand forints last year, they are now unable to obtain for even ten thousand.
The Daily basket in the examined hypermarkets crossed the ten thousand HUF psychological limit by at least 91 HUF.
The highest basket value was HUF 10 573.
(In 2003, the basket cost HUF 6800.)
The price of Unicum and live fish remained almost on last year's level, but the turkey breast fillet, nuts and poppy, was also very expensive.
The prices of flour and bread followed KSH's data in the shops, although in Auchan we found one kilogram of bread for HUF 139.
The competition did not lower the price of the product to less than HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this business that the price of Coca-Cola with the two-litre removable bottle was below HUF 200, so with the deposit fee they only asked for 257 forints for the product.
However, this year Auchan was the most expensive in the Daily basket, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora has increased by 15 percent compared to Christmas prices last year, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18-18 percent the prices in their daily basket.
Compared to last year's most expensive and cheapest baskets, the difference was 12 percent, while between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive, the increase was 21 percent.
In Forint, the average increase was 1480.
Last year, the average price increase came to HUF 1206, with the effect of the VAT increase in prices last Christmas.
This is precisely the process that has disrupted trade, and apparently it has not been possible for the stores to decide how much margin to apply to each product, because they have been unable to calculate the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If the speed of rotation of a product is poorly planned by the trader, it can lose a significant profit on the traffic intensity adjusted margin.)
The price increase of the Daily basket was so extreme last year because of the VAT, that the most expensive was 1720 HUF more than the 2006 value, while the price difference was only 844 HUF.
This extremity was not shown this year, as the most expensive one was 1630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest one was 1284 forints more expensive.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, there was a disastrous price increase, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets increasing by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, by the way, does not necessarily justify the data of the CSO: for some basic foods, the statistical office has increased by more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months.
For example, besides flour, eggs.)
According to the Daily basket, this seems almost impossible in the latter case, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, resulted in a price increase of less than 10 percent compared to the base in the worst case scenario.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than the eggmen, and they have managed to trick the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the trade gold triangle, hypers don't complain, they keep telling us about a good year.
In our experience, most of the customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy quantity from everything, and they carry durable foods in flats.
On Wednesday morning, all three stores developed serious lines in front of the cashiers, because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that there is less traffic in the countryside, more multi-complaining to research companies that even their plans are lagging behind, not only in the case of food but also in the case of durable consumer products.
In many places they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overburden of staff do not favour the stopping of infections, says the head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They also save on disinfectants in many places.
There's been a recent diagnosis of MRSA infection in traumatology at John's Hospital.
In a man admitted after a major accident, an antibiotic - resistant bacteria were detected.
Patient's been isolated.
A similar infection occurred here at the beginning of the year.
A serious car accident victim was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter she had to return with MRSA infection, and an important surgery was still unable to be performed due to the bacteria in her body.
Until 10 December this year, hospitalized infection caused by 1094 multi-resistant pathogens was reported to the National Nosocomial Survey System, said Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiological Center, Karolina Böröcz.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens are definitely registered in hospitals, and the rest is unknown.
About two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. the staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacylline.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inadequately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics develop a highly resistant bacteria that spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
When the immune system works either temporarily or permanently, severe hospital infections such as wound infection or sepsis may occur in patients with a weakened body, elderly or low body weight.
According to the director of the John Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection should not be mixed with the disease, MRSA is just not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not investigated.
Resisting Antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff provides the patient with rubber gloves and masks, and they have the right antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients entering the hospital will be tested for MRSA in the first place, but the infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling Is Not Fashionous
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current hospital conditions and conditions are not favourable for the prevention of the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection typically occurs in hospitals, in nursing homes, hospitals should check patients entering and isolate patients carrying MRSA immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in fashion in Hungarian hospitals.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these investigations.
Most of the cases will be brought to light if the patient has a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent resistance to medicinal products, but hospitals do not always adhere to this.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in outpatient or primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Saves on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most commonly transmitted from one patient to another by healthcare personnel.
Therefore, washing hands, using gloves, masking plays a very important role, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is spread by droplet infection and contact, however, it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, the wards are often crowded, often very close to each other, although patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also noticeable that Karolina Böröcz noted that in unfavorable hospitals they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients, so there is an even greater risk of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate precautions are taken, there is less evidence of such infection or the spread of the pathogen.
Steering programme against MRSA
Managing MRSA infection causes huge costs to health insurance companies, so they fight it everywhere.
In England, for example, it included a reduction in the prevention or occurrence of MRSA in the government programme.
The programme appears to be successful, and according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) are the development of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such pathogens.
He wasn't drunk on the death-accident police captain.
A formal expert opinion on the fatal accident caused by the XXII Police Commissioner has been prepared.
It can be ruled out that he would have led his post drunk or in a state of intoxication in the meantime by the District XXII Commissioner, who hit a pedestrian to death on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, spokesperson of the Metropolitan Prosecutor's Office on Friday after the expert opinion on this.
The expert opinion confirmed the primary test result, which has already established that the former police commissioner did not drink alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
The then head of the XXII. district Precinct hit the 55-year-old man on Tuesday, who did not want to cross the road on the other side of the road in his own car.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian did not cross the zebra, is not a mitigating circumstance under the rules of the Transport Code, but the driving driver who turns must give priority.)
The pedestrian died after being admitted to the hospital.
As a result of what happened, the district police chief resigned from his post and asked for his retirement, according to the police report, because he was so shaken by the incident.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police commissioner had cooperated with the investigating prosecutors from the beginning.
Another €400 million infrastructure
Three credit lines with a total value of EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy have been signed by János Veres, Minister of Finance and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) in Budapest on Friday.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million envelope in 2006 for the financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund, of which a 100 million loan agreement has already been concluded by the parties, and the contract now signed is about the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million loan agreement also serves to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later by extending the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract, which is used primarily for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, we also talked about Metro 4.
They agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this could take place in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans is provided by the EIB with an 8-year grace period and without a maintenance commission linked to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the EU property haven
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on the previously little mentioned Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the EU's still cheapest, but rapidly more expensive market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most popular real estate purchase destination in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and beach houses.
Among the mountains are the most fashionable areas of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa, while on the beach are Albena, "Golden Beach", "Napospart", ancient Sozopol and Odsbar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract the interest of investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more people are buying around the extremely cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia, also offers attractive opportunities, and commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive European golf havens, making it a priority destination for the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
For this reason, far-sighted investors are already buying largely, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, the buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles.
Most of the customers are English, but they come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present and there are traditionally many Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in ski havens.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three categories, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers either buy renovated properties at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100 thousand, or destroyed old houses for between EUR 5 and 15 thousand, and then renovate them.
They require good accessibility and communication opportunities, they care about the proximity of a big city, shops and local doctors in general.
The second category is for vacationers (Bulgaria was added to the list of the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term value growth.
The price of capital real estate continues to increase, as demand is growing.
Although housing prices in Bulgaria are the lowest in the European Union, they have increased by 21 percent per year over the last five years.
The increase in house prices is fundamentally above the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday, and after the official opening on Wednesday, the discussion of the international climate regime after 2012 will continue with the negotiations of the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, there is a heated debate on this between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not currently wish to discuss precise figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big issue of the conference is whether developed countries are willing to provide financial and technological assistance to countries in need, in addition to reducing emissions.
There has also been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, as provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of 16 members, which is expected to be managed within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), in the Market and Profit.
6 percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for Environment and Water, supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the post-2012 agreement, and is prepared to reduce up to 30% if other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to assume their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 percent, including the EU - at that time 15 Member States - minus 8 percent.
The Hungarian obligation is 6 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1985-87 period, which Hungary will meet. - recalls the Ministry of Environment's press release.
The stakes in Bali are high, as the long-term international climate policy agreement needs to be concluded within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would be delayed beyond 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by another international emission reduction system, which was also highlighted by the latest report of the IPCC, the UN Nobel Peace Prize International Panel on Climate Change.
This would delay emission reductions and make it inevitable to increase Earth's average temperature above 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British army is recruiting on YouTube
The British military units are publishing footage of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing to promote themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube for the first time: Special Forces in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban since March 2006, said the BBC.
These miniature, helmet-mounted cameras are controlled by the Air Force Operation Command in Kandahar and then sent to London, where the domestics upload them to the Internet.
The Political Message Is Inescapable
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 images on the Internet in this form, and their "channel" has been watched by over 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and publishes videos of actions both in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Commonwealth Office and the Iraqi International Peacekeeping Forces (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Use in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention, he posted the videos for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defence, it is also good to make the public aware of the real purpose of the army's presence abroad.
Propaganda published in this form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment advertisements - said Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but it inevitably carries some political message, as it demonstrates the existence of military actions decided by the government in a specific form.
The Americans made a game.
In addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, the army also has a problem with amateur videos on the divisor, which, for example, represent the death of soldiers: in slightly hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, officers talk about losses at best, but do not show the bloody side of the fight.
By the way, a number of videos of the Iraqi and Afghanistan military scenes have been released on the Internet in live missions, but the British army has only recently received them.
The Americans are recruiting a little different, with the free downloadable shooting game America's Army, in which the player can go straight into the soldiers' skin in a more or less lifelike simulation.
It's gonna be a scavenger hunt and sconey Christmas at the Ministries.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold a year-end workshop for his colleagues, who will be able to thank him with scones and coffee from 2007.
There's a ministry where there's a live music party, somewhere else, with raffle and cheers, they're bringing a Christmas spirit to the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so have fun with the power.
The state offices are getting ready for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party of the Ministry is held this year by the Defense Department, but HM is not waiting for the Ministry staff.
The children of the fallen soldiers receive gifts at Orphan Christmas, and at Mission Christmas they host family members of soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions, but they also host a press reception.
The wallet has 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GKM) are out of control compared to the other wallets.
The GKM party is held in the House of the Future, out of a total of HUF 4,320,000, and of the 600 ministry employees, about three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
They'll stick to the Christmas spirit at the wallet ceremony, but there'll be performers and a raffle.
The Christmas of the NFU cost 4 700 000 HUF, and it was held in the building of the National Council of Justice (OIT) on Wednesday - concerts and dinner were also held.
The room rental cost HUF 1 million, and the remaining part was spent on more than 400 guests.
One department of the NFU is also invited to another Christmas celebration: this is organised by a tender management company, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, with EU money.
The purpose was to rent the building of the Vigszínház.
The information was not confirmed at MAG Zrt, as we failed to reach the person responsible.
I don't need a suit.
The OIT building hosted not only the N.F.U., but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Luca Day Ball on 7 December instead of Christmas.
He didn't ask for money from them for the use of the OIT rooms.
There were 500 people at the ball.
The party started with the Minister's toast, and after dinner you could dance to live music.
The [origo] question was asked: at the ball there was absolutely no obligation on the evening dress or the suit.
Puritan parties are organized in the medical, labour and municipal wallets.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees in its own building for 400,000 HUF.
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, is officially waiting for a year-end workshop, not for a Christmas party.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive only coffee and scones - the press department said - so the party will be brought out of 350 000 forints.
However, Minister Gordon Bajnai will simply toast with his colleagues in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, for which 436 people are expected.
2,500 HUF per guest for the Christmas party - a buffet reception and a toast are included.
Since János Veres is the minister, the employees of the PM have been doing a similar Christmas every year.
However, there will be no party atmosphere, the officiality is confirmed not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon.
The agriculture portfolio will host a New Year's reception on 20 January, and the Ministry Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception is held in Vajdahunyadvár, in the City Park, and according to the statement of the wallet 1000 HUF is dedicated to the hundred guests.
This, according to the press department, will be a very simple standing reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a short ministerial toast and end with a moderate snack.
There is no Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture - the [origo] has been announced in the relevant press departments.
They couldn't tell me the price of an environmental wallet's official Christmas in the press department.
At any rate, more than 400 people were invited to the party at the Museum of Artists.
The Powers of the Giant Stray are gathering
On Friday, the League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Labour Councils will form their strike committee to coordinate an indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, and on Monday - the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - the cessation of work will begin.
The action in transport will certainly cause a major disruption, as rail transport will almost stop completely and will also be on strike at the BKV until 13:00.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will present the details of the Monday strike organised together with the National Labour Councils Association.
The LIGA - MOS strike committee will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, and from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will cease work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been marked - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of the end of the strike that started.
If the Parliament does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for action.
If, on the other hand, they vote in favour of the legislation, then the strike committees will meet and decide on a continuation.
On the basis of the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the health insurance bill will be voted only in late-night, possibly night hours.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, significant traffic disruptions can be expected: the railway stops work for an indefinite period, and in the morning a part of Budapest public transport, more than half of the Volán companies, can stop.
At the same time, there will be a semi-track roadblock in many parts of the country.
A number of trade unions and NGOs joined the strike call, and their list is updated continuously on the League's day.
Some organisations reported strikes for an indefinite period of time, while others announced temporary cessations.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union of MÁV and Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) could not even agree on a sufficient service, even though as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people travel by rail.
According to previous reports, they strike from the start of operation until 13:00 at BKV, Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., a four-hour strike is being held by LIGA Electric and Heat Trade Unions, a 2-hour and a 2- to-8 hour work break is being called for by the Trade Union of Teachers and the Democratic Trade Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes at different times, and the Democratic Trade Union of Workers (EDDSZ) of the Health and Social Sector of the SEF is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraws its proposal for health insurance reform and provides a new concept for social debate.
The second demand is to gradually introduce the new method of calculation of pensions due from next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers of the League of Trade Unions (VDSSZ) does not accept the offer of railway wing lines by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: the Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the Jobbik Hungary Movement, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects according to the Risk Analysing Division of Political Capital.
The company wrote in its "risk warning" that the greatest political risk of the Hungarian Guard's activities is that "with the already existing ethnic tension between the Hungarian Roma and non-Gypsy population, violent ethnic clashes can occur in the short term".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is likely to provoke such an act, the research institute added.
As they wrote, this is due to one of the main failures of Hungarian political actors: "the public discussion of Roma issues was allowed by public figures to represent radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict".
This deepens the problem, renders normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts, they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard have "encouraged the image of Hungary abroad, particularly as regards the country's stability and democratic development", as a result of great domestic and international media attention.
It is recalled that from the autumn of 2006, Hungary's radical and far-right groups became increasingly publicized and boosted as part of the reorganization of radical and far-right groups, that from the summer of 2007 several organisations calling themselves "national self-defence" were formed in Hungary.
"The common feature of these groupings is to define themselves as a civil society organisation, while openly proclaiming the preparation of their members, whether armed, for defence (crash protection, defence, law enforcement) tasks, and on the grounds of the inadequacy of the police, the army, or the state", they added.
They noted that this is done in accordance with the method which, based on the anti-political and anti-partisan nature of society, seeks to put various political aspirations in a civilian robe.
The emphasis on civility and the form of an association is therefore not only intended to avoid legal pitfalls in court registration for these associations, but also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential threat in several neighbouring states, and in some neighbouring countries ultranationalist political actors wish to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
This has an impact on the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, so political risks have increased for the whole region.
As they wrote, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right National Union of Bulgaria (BNU).
The formation of the Bulgarian Guard is backed by the mass of Roma riots in one quarter of Sofia (Krasna Polyana).
The BNU used this to decide on the formation of the Guard, saying that the purpose of the organization was "national self-defense".
In the past 17 years, they believe that Bulgaria has experienced a gypsy terrorist, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative provoked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it has been written, the risk of ethnic clashes is marked by the fact that some Roma organisations in Bulgaria have announced that they are creating their own guard as resistance.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Guard so far is similar to the operation of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma will likewise respond to the threat by organising their own self-defense, says the Political Capital risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they release their risk analysis every year, and if they experience anything that might affect the change in risk, they will inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
Not everywhere is the holiday in red letters
In Hungary, red-letter days are clearly marked by the law, and around the holidays the day shift has become a common practice, of which there will be fewer next year.
It is not a united holiday in the EU and America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Holidays are mostly linked to church holidays, illustrious historical events.
We also celebrate New Year's Eve: the last day of the old year and the new first day are both public holidays - the latter just so that New Year's Evers can relax.
By the way, we have 11 red-letter holidays all year round.
National holiday is also the Memorial Day of the Revolution of 1956 on 15 March and 23 October, which commemorates the Revolution of 1848.
On 20 August we celebrate the founding of the state, on 1 May we celebrate the work, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead relatives and friends.
In addition, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas are two-day holidays.
Since our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekends, it has become a practice to relocate working days in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red-letter holiday.
True, the cost of extended weekends is that on the previous Saturdays we do not stay away from work school.
The exact date of the day immediately preceding or following the holiday has been regulated by the Minister for Labour in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation covers all employers and workers employed by them, public servants and those in public service relations.
However, it does not affect service companies and institutions operating without interruption and operating on public holidays as a result of their intended purpose.
This year only around the end-of-year holidays will change the working schedule: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, since experience shows that the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve are "slipped" by most people, or use their saved vacations for this purpose.
Next year, we will have more holidays in the middle of the week and at the end of the week, so there will be less work-day shifts than this year.
First, the calendar is transformed around the celebration of the work, so that the employees can stay at home for four days.
It will be a Saturday working day on 26 April in exchange for Friday 2 May rest day.
The second transfer is related to the celebration of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, instead of Friday 24.
However, the end of the year can be fully celebrated next year, since almost everywhere from 24 December a non-stop break will take place even if the New Year's Eve is on Wednesday.
Six daunting little things to piss off your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never get, innocent lies that we almost don't even notice: they "color" everyday at work.
The question is, do you get used to small inconveniences or put on gloves and consciously avoid misunderstandings that cause annoyance to others?
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you about the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting because of that?
At best, he's sorry, and he's trying to make amends, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before making awkward excuses, it is worth considering what it is that can give your colleagues unpleasant moments and consciously strive to avoid this.
You're borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more annoying than reaching for a document, office supplies, or your phone, and it's not there.
Do you remember yesterday when you put your stapler on the table, but by morning, you had your feet on the table?
Perhaps you'll discover your lost pen on one of your colleagues' desks?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, because they're right to be mad at you for riding their property.
Don't pocket the office envelopes, post-it, 'cause it might be awkward if it runs out prematurely, and you need it right away.
Are you gossiping about colleagues' personal lives?
There's no good way to stop the rumor that's already spreading.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not tie your information (conditions) to everyone's personal life.
If one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust.
Bury the things you have heard and do not discuss with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about the things your colleague has been wearing.
You're gonna call in sick without a reason?
When you call in to the office and call in sick because you have a splitting headache, because you feel unwell or that you would rather rest that day; think of your work, your impending work, your futures, and your work for yourself will have to be done by someone else.
Don't mess with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you're not going to the office the next day, or if there's something you need to stay at home for, let your colleagues and your boss know not to face your absence the next day.
Boobs, giggles, phone calls
You're in the middle of your work, but you're getting the giggles out of it?
Unwittingly, did you witness a telephone conversation that would have been better left unheard of?
Do not disturb your colleagues by humming, singing, talking loudly (which you carry on over their heads), or by beating feet, constantly swearing, and with loud dissatisfaction.
These can be all confusing, even if they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organizing).
Do you blame other people for mistakes?
If you don't have something in time, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, don't blame anyone else for your forgetfulness.
Don't refer to the chaos in your office, your noisy colleagues.
Admit it, if you made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage for someone else, and eliminate the damage.
Ask him how you can make up for your mistake, make up for your failure.
Are you feeling too comfortable in the office?
Bear shorts and slippers: comfortable clothing for home, but not for the office!
Don't wear comfortable leisure clothes even if you're allowed to do your job.
Don't be a slob, your colleagues, and honor yourself by wearing ordinary clothes - if your job requires you to go into the office in a nice, elegant way!
If you want to live up to it, you're no longer interesting.
Harvesting with the car in the usual morning traffic.
From the radio there is a special melody: the sound of a violin, accompanied by electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The music changes pace and the bass arrives next to the earlier sounds, and then the female choir is joined as a real jewel.
Zagar's Wings of Love is playing on mr2.
For a long time, our home music life did not pamper us with high-quality electronic pop.
But now it seems like it's a whole different plug if you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some of the new and exciting productions coming up from the Hungarian digital underground change slowly in the overall picture, and even though the guitar-throwing garage rock is back in fashion, the domestic electropop also proves that there is new under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started from Pécs, and he himself played in Yonderboi's orchestra, until - perhaps because two pipers couldn't fit in a csárda - he took his own path.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, but began to break through when he was asked to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Turkish Ferenc Season).
The formations of the first smaller clubs were first introduced to a wider audience when Wwan2 magazine ranked their first album in 2002 as one of the 50 most important Hungarian albums and declared Zagar, in Yonderboi's company, to almost the only Hungarian trendmakers who appeared marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band became "trendi", but no one asked them if they liked to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should: they made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead now released can open up new paths for them, although the title itself aims to create continuity with the initial years of Pécs.
This was one of the lines of Balázs Zságer's old band there.
With the airy, flying reference, we'd be in the right place, but besides the airiness of music, we've now noticed the effect of louder guitar, rock and roll, according to the spirit and trend of the time.
In these songs, György Ligeti, the singer currently working with The Puzzle in England, presented himself at the premiere of the album in Millenáris.
The album also produced a real radio hit, and recently Mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music from morning to evening, began to smuggle into the ears the grand tunes of Wings of Love recorded with the six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is okay (?).
He asked Balázs Zságer at hvg.hu.
hvg.hu: This new hit brings up the question: how much layer music do you play?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of soft music castes; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
So-called alternative underground music can be flat, meaningless, and equally prepared for mere sale, which makes them commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from a sincere motivation.
The host attitude also operates in this spirit, regardless of language or national boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
Zs.B.: Light music has bigger traditions abroad, especially to the west of us.
It's not just the age of ten or twenty, it's also the seniors.
Rather, they monitor the changes in light music around them, because they are considered to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
We don't have music for purpose, we have music for some reason.
The role of the audience is more perceptible at concerts, where there is already an impact on each other, but it is only in the elusive changes of the moment.
Still, I find that if you want to meet the audience, you're no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's a soloist, and he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path, regardless of the fact that sometimes they try to explain it in our music.
We're more of a team player who trusts the other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our work was compared to Yonderboi’s music, since many of us left his orchestra and started on another route.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on the top list of Petőfi mr2.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time about this song.
Are you consciously opening up with a more popular style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell the album.
This song is more than that.
It was meant to be the finale of the album, which we used to try to unlock the sound orgies on the album and the difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guiding principle?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
And that's when the idea came to put together this choir from the sounding soloists of our own home music scene.
That is how the six members of the choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Jude Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Was the song designed or played exactly like this?
Zs.B.: The number had long existed in instrumental versions, and then when the record came together, we thought we needed something else for this number.
It was the chord that attracted me to singing on it.
That same night, I sang the melody that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first time and scaryly spontaneous.
I remember it was very electrifying back then, but of course I needed the Belles.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked that hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the album and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
There is no solo (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no role to play, they sing together and they are not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were standing in the back was simply because of technical problems.
But what is clear is that we didn't want to play solo roles.
That's what my mouth is all about. Let's forget about our ego for a little while. Let's just let those wings, the wings of love, lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work?
Zs.B.: In the musical creative process, there were actually no more difficult pieces than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play a tournament piano, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove didn't want to work for a long time, then slowly everything was in place, like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song about the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I "let go" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitorous broker risked billions because of a feeling of inferiority
Infidel embezzler.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French bank giant Sociéte Générale, calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
Because of Kerviel, he lost almost EUR 5 billion.
However, it seems that Kerviel, who was not at all untalented, was more of a player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike other banks, he was able to identify the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He's got a reduced mental capacity," he said to his superiors who alerted the police.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel’s testimony revealed that at the end of last year he made a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his businesses.
Crisis Not Only in America
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros in the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news appeared that there would be problems with so-called subprime mortgages for low-income clients or clients with past repayment problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe in that and put me on a good horse.
At the end of the year, its profits reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I made the first half a billion, I didn't know how to announce it," admits Kerviel and adds that he didn't keep anything to himself.
In his testimony, he admits that he forged his reports in such a way that it could not be found out.
He managed to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock market became interested in his business.
The risk was a profit
Were you afraid it would come out?
I'd rather not.
"I thought the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would calm them down."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He gradually reached his position.
After graduating from the University of Lyon, he worked at Société Générale Bank from 2000.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker and became an independent broker with a salary of $90,000 a year in 2005.
Yet, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"In 2005 I knew from my first conversation that they were looking at me badly.
My education, professional and personal development," Kerviel told the detectives.
Soon after he entered, the first great success came.
Allianz made a profit thanks to its shares, as in the London bombings, it put up half a billion euros to the fall of these shares.
And it started an avalanche - he wanted more.
As long as you're looking, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But his bosses said they knew everything, or rather suspected.
"While I was making money, they turned a blind eye."
But there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to cover it up in mid-January one weekend.
When he left for work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion.
And how did they find out?
He became suspicious because of his freedom.
"I've only taken four days in the last year.
A broker who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his reports," Kerviel finished.
Czech Republic has a chance of getting 365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, with the Czech Republic obtaining EUR 14 billion (approximately 365 billion krona) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
The regions will receive around 125 billion kronor from seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion kroner, is for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operating programme and represents 22 percent of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to gain assets for innovation businesses.
Companies should also have the resources to introduce new technologies, industrial research, but also to introduce more efficient organisational methods.
The Czech Republic is one of the least successful in obtaining funds from the EU funds in the framework of the newly recruited countries.
Ex-President Nicaragua has been approved by the court for 20 years
On Thursday, the Appeal Court in Nicaragua approved a 20-year prison sentence for financial fraud of USD 100 million (almost 1.8 billion kroner) to Arnold Alemán, the former President of the country.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital city.
Whether the former leader of this Central American country between 1997 and 2002 will be put back behind bars is not yet clear, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Appeals Court, Ileana Perez, it will be up to the prison administration to decide whether to leave Alema to serve her sentence at home or to go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that government funds were regularly transferred to foreign companies in Panama.
In reality, these fictitious companies and their account numbers belonged to relatives and their closest supporters.
He then made some of these funds to a foundation, which he founded to finance Alemán's 2001 election campaign.
They've approved our budget.
That's right.
They've accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget drawn up by this government, approved by a coalition majority, without opposition support.
Last year, this went through with the support of the Social Democrats, because Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democratic Party could not afford to accept the no.
Unlike a loud debate on mistrust of the government before the vote, there was no drama this time.
The House of Representatives accepted this generally ignored, although the most influential law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance begins and ends with each chapter and item in the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the struggles of government and opposition powers.
This is more grateful in the press, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
Politicians' debates are more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the past social democratic governments have had three shortcomings which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
The first of them is the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called principal expenditure, which means not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM before the elections last year.
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the first deficiency.
The third limit is deficits in public finances, i.e. deficits in the budgets of cities and districts.
However, the biggest risk is not a deficit in the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
Timing bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and districts.
Many mayors can make money for investments other than money from taxes, levies, and bank loans, and they have often issued bonds with which their city halls are disproportionately indebted.
In recent years, these debts have been repaid by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks which the State has obtained from privatisations.
They don't have a source like that anymore.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
For some years, our economy has been going through a growth phase, like the rest of the world, with which the Czech Social Democratic Party is constantly boasting.
This was a unique opportunity for governments to put public funding in order.
Instead, however, the country was increasingly in debt.
The other countries managed much more rationally than Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, the Czech Republic.
This is primarily a huge disgrace to the former governments.
We belong to countries that are least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
This is why there is no need, for example, for large social programmes, which have, unfortunately, become gigantic in recent years, completely unnecessary.
Although this year we have managed to eliminate the part of pointless populist spending approved before the elections, even if there is no delay in extending the retirement and pension reform, any policy in this country will actually end and whoever governs it will become official.
With a little exaggeration, the majority of the taxed money from governor politicians is usually turned into pensions and social benefits into mechanical distributors.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by expenditure on principals.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments hadn't wasted everything they could have done in the last decade.
If we do not want them to become mere officials of the governing politicians, then we must be patient and seek peace of mind for the preparation of further reform laws for this not-too-strong coalition government, who is aware that the state can only give out what it can obtain from taxes and levies.
Only these will enable a balanced budget to be reached gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
Money markets are thus costing more than $100 billion through stock exchanges.
On these exchanges, interest rates are raised on the bank, for which they are prepared to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will release $40 billion on the stock exchange, and 24 more will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
For the first time after the attacks on the 11th of September, the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl, consultant at Economic Outlook Group in his report.
"The coordinated action of the central banks in the United States has reduced the probability of recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent," said Baumohl.
Banks in the United States have already lost $60 billion in non-refundable loans in the first place.
Analysts expect further billion-dollar losses.
"The central banks may indeed be afraid of what could happen if they decided to do so," said Kieran Davies, chief economist of ABN Amro.
It seems to be really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce the need and drive the American economy into recession with its potential consequences for the economic growth of the world as a whole.
This was decided by the central banks after the failure to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank supply rate, which is used in the interbank market for borrowing money.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain also reduced their interest rates a few times during the autumn.
"This will have a similar effect to the further drop in interest," said Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' actions contribute to the resolution of the crisis, as they do not solve the underlying problem, the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The Incredible Debates of Ecologists
Global climate change is a major threat to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave his opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time he criticised the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
His book Blue presented in Vienna, not the green planet, made it clear that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a particular mix of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that accompanies it.
"The debate there absolutely lacks the structure, it's just throwing words, which are a substitute for solving the current problems," said Klaus.
In presenting the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for his subject, which is why he is so committed to this issue.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the book is also published in German translation, because, as he said, "I often only meet cartoons of my opinion".
So now the interested can read your undistorted opinion.
Klaus reminded me that although he is not a climate scientist, he believes that he has sufficient funds to write such a book.
Because he has been able to monitor and evaluate professional studies as an academic in statistics and also as an economist.
In conclusion of the book, he indicated that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. that changes are normal, and that all scientists do not share the same opinion about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so they are not a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in totalitarianism, he finds it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he perceives as dangerous restrictions on freedom.
He once again explained that "it is not against rational protection of the environment, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
Klaus spoke of a similar subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't change their driver's licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and couldn't change their old driver's license in time, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can request a replacement so that the offices can issue a new driver's license in time by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that a hundred thousand drivers would leave after the New Year without valid privileges.
According to the offices, the driver's license was not replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While the districts represent a sharp fall in interest in driver's license exchanges, the capital offices were flooded with applications for driver's license exchanges, for which there was an increased interest this week.
The mayor's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It takes about half an hour to line up.
In Prague, the driver’s license has not yet been replaced by about 140000 drivers.
A new driver's license will last 20 days.
However, the new licence may be requested with a five-day shorter period.
In such a case, however, the driver will have to pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to carry out the compulsory driver’s licence change by the end of the year and who are leaving with an invalid licence are under penalty from January.
The guilty must pay a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
However, the policeman may settle the offence by agreement.
In the case of administrative offences, the penalty is 2500 kroner.
Based on previous information from City Hall, anyone who doesn't travel anywhere can also be fined.
Supposedly, you can pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had previously called on the agencies to be lenient and to impose a maximum sentence of 1,000 crowns.
According to the Ministry of Transport's spokesman Karel Hanzelka, however, there are no tens of thousands of fines threatening anyone.
He thinks a license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not an identity card that should be valid for everyone.
Those of you who don't want to drive anymore should give up your driver's license.
It's enough to take it or to mail it to the proper office.
At the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993 no longer apply.
However, drivers must gradually replace the other types of driving licences.
Those with documents from 1994 to 2000 can replace them for another three years.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million additional documents.
The court reduced the sentence of Berdycchel's co-opt detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, suspected of conspiring with David Berdych’s criminal networks, were sentenced to 13 and 10 years in prison.
This was determined by the Prague Supreme Court with definitive effect, which thus reduced their sentences to one and two years for one and the other.
Investigators of the Prague Organized Crime Division were originally threatened by 14 and 12 years of prison.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed; review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Berdych is also suspected in this case, he is waiting for a first-degree verdict.
In other proceedings, he has already been sentenced to more than 16 years in total.
You can't have any more.
In January, the County Court found primarily 19 people guilty of robbery, of which 16 appeals were dealt with today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the charges from the beginning of the investigation by saying it was a matter of speculation.
According to the Senate in Central Bohemia, police members provided information to criminals after the agreement with Berdycc from police sources, covered each robbery and helped the gang avoid criminal responsibility.
So the gang turned in 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
In the indictment, we are talking about gang crimes between 1999 and 2001.
These are mainly robberies whose victims have often suffered serious harm to their health, but also abuse of the authority of a civil servant and unauthorised possession of weapons.
Because the police have illegally held guns, steel-core bullets, laser sightings, or machine guns in search of homes.
The gang is charged with taking tens of millions of crowns with the robberies.
In this proceeding, the gang of 20 members who are short of one has already been admitted legally guilty by the courts of other Berdych robberies and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment testify before the courts in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
So far, the first-degree trial has avoided Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, awaiting a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic.
Account for child exchange: 12 million
Igor Veleba, the lawyer of the injured families for children traded in maternity services, claims 12 million crowns of pain from the hospital in Třebíč, plus court expenses.
For mothers, three million each, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The hospital's legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, fundamentally disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a demand, because it is too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"In order to have an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
We'll find out if it has any useful value at all.
But we maintain our view that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands for everyone," emphasized Dostal.
According to him, the sum should be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until they raised their own biological daughter.
Veleba was subjected to a review by experts on the basis of the compensation negotiations prepared by Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, children’s parents suffered various degrees of psychological damage and stress.
The stress situation was more tolerated by men, even if they encountered reproaches that did not prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women are worse at coping with the actuality of the trauma they experienced and what is happening right now, she summarized the contents of Veleba.
Veronika and Nicolia were replaced by nurses at Třebíč obstetrics on 9 December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola Čermákék Přibyslavice, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina’s district manager Miloš Vystrčil handed over 100,000 kroner to the families to replace their expenses, resulting from the fault of the hospital in Třebíčské, which is controlled by the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic have compulsory insurance for damages under the law.
In case of error, they must reach into the reserve fund, in exceptional cases they may ask for the help of the founder.
To date, the courts have approved relatively low compensations for people, and the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand tables, in exceptional cases a few million crown tables.
Polívka lost his kingdom of Valašsko
Bolek Polívka lost his lawsuit for the title of the Valašsko kingdom.
According to the judge of the district court in Ostrava, although he first used the name King Vanchi, the project was developed by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, who collaborated with the actor.
Polívka didn't attend the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is about the popularity of Mr Harabiš and his team Polívka Bolek," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
He thinks the words of the Valachi kingdom remind everyone of the actor-comic.
This opinion is shared by Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
The search for money and the invention of actions," he said.
He thinks the cause of the argument is money.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and they could gain something from it.
They want to prey on our work," he added.
Profitable Business
According to the court, the name of King Vanch was first used by Polívka on television.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned it.
However, this was not linked to the purpose of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing the Vanchi passports.
The original student prank operation became a business and a profitable entrepreneurial activity, on which Harabiš founded the creation of a society of the Valašsko Kingdom.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to sign his name and signature in passports and even offered discounts to their owners when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who takes the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš himself was using the idea that Polívka made public in order to make his business public.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka for the Valachi Kingdom project must have helped," said the judge.
However, he added that the soul of the project was the intensive work of Harabiš and his team.
The cooperation of the today's quarrels continued until 2000, when he organised an official coronation for Harabiš Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been debates between Polívka and Harabiš, which have come to the exoneration of "King Boleslav, who has been elected forever".
At the initiative of Harabiš, Jarmila Šulaková took the lead in the kingdom as queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a court action against Harabiš and his associates, which was rejected by the court today.
The battle planned by Harabiš could bring light to the debate for the throne and for half of the princess.
This fight should make you a new king.
He didn't want to give me the details and the time.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It's supposed to be something like a King's march in Slovaco.
The king should be elected for a limited period of time.
Mr Polívka can also apply in peace," said Harabiš.
Test of 207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot: Vanishing Prejudice
Honestly, I never liked Peugeot 206.
The characteristics of the journey are nothing special, the quality of the change, the driving and the production can also often be marked as below average.
But the Peugeot 207, its successor to the market, is significantly better.
And the station wagon called "SW" goes one more step further, so all I have left to do is think more.
When I was testing the classic Hatchback of the Peugeot 207, for example, I complained in the back seat about the place left for the head.
This time, the complaining is now over, since the bodywork of the station wagon means that the giants two meters tall are no longer suffering in this regard.
Speedy in the World
I can get through the inner space quickly so I don't repeat myself many times.
This is a relatively good design, where my only objection is to the poor console.
Here, I'd appreciate a little more designer training, if the look of the car is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we complained about the short lower part of the seat or the armrests.
Side management also significantly improved against model 206.
As far as space is concerned, you can also see the increase in body size.
The station wagon then disappears the few places of the head that have been mentioned.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing on this vehicle is therefore the luggage compartment.
I must consider this to be very accessible (and thanks to the fold-out rear window) and spacious.
Empty spaces are equipped with support tyres, which are ideal compromises.
They're not in the way, they're disassembled, and they can carry heavier objects.
But let's stick to the volume a little bit.
This is based on the tables in the basic layout 428 l, which is rather an average value over competition.
However, it is not the most sought-after vehicle in the Czech Republic - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If you compare 207 SW to the new generation of mladá Boleslav, you will find that Peugeot is well behind the noticeably many 52 litres.
This value is almost critical for a holiday abroad or for inserting a stroller.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I would have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the backrests of the second row are down or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
The vehicle we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder, light-ignition engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a capacity of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, it should look like the one-sixteenth that drives the family Hatchback.
It's quiet, it's low-consumption, and it pulls primarily.
If we compare it to Škoda's equivalent, which often acts as if a rag had been stuffed into its exhaust, I can only be happy about that.
The price is a whisper.
The price of a car is not cheap.
However, we must remember that we tested a car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The car is still going for 329 900 Kč with a four-cylinder motor.
The car starts with 410 990 Kč, which is quite a lot.
The tested Premium is equipped with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Only we had airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, rear windows, electrical remote control...
So the car costs 531 900 Kč with a case-towing.
This is a lot, but count Fabia's additional equipment and get very similar results.
So all that's left is the choice for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools has failed
In British schools, more and more Eastern European children are becoming concerned about the further development of local school affairs.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans is facing a number of obstacles.
British schools have already registered cases where disputes between the children of immigrants and residents have turned into violence.
The problems with the integration of children in Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in Northern Kent where disputes between their places and Slovak immigrants are intensified.
Arguments and quarrels between students characterize the relationship between parents.
The situation got to the point where the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
The culprit defends by insulting him with racist curses.
The police had to act after two 12 - year - old girls attacked Slovak immigrants.
The girls said the man was being scolded with racist remarks and throwing stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he struck us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his naked ass," the mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents classified disputes about immigrants in Eastern Europe as survival struggles.
The above cases suggest that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who earn work.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, this can be done if you choose correctly.
The golden and white shores, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive on the beach with waiters offering pizza, ice cream or intoxicated cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a complete and even richer list.
However, on an island you can find much more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
Under the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their American conquests.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place human eyes have ever seen.
Havana has become a treasure warehouse and a transfer site that the Spaniards robbed in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, a boss of the American mafia, built it because everything that was considered a crime in the U.S. (primarily prohibition) was welcomed in Cuba and supported drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests, for example,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana towers were built, and on the broad avenues there were cars that became the cult symbol of the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and owned his own yacht in Cojimar.
The walls of Bodeguita del Medio are decorated with the signatures of American showbusiness stars and politicians.
And today?
The Bodeguita wall in Havana can be signed by you.
They're making you a cocktail at the bar at the expensive Nacional Hotel.
And the cult cars of the '50s are still in Havana, because the once exported viscous and your son have long since rotted in this salty and wet air.
Although the oldest part of Havana in the first place is significantly depleted, nowhere else in the area is there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there is there.
Other places are getting prettier, like Trinidad.
Given that tourism provides so much needed money, its development has been given a green light.
New hotels have been built not only in Havana for the last 15 years, but also in Varader, on the shores of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers yet another unique delicacies in the world, primarily appreciated by train lovers.
From their extensive plantations, the cane was delivered to the sugar plants by steam and motor trains.
Their motor park has not been renewed for decades, so there are machines operating there, whose contemporaries are seen elsewhere only in museums.
Which way do we go?
Most of Cuba's most famous places are not avoided.
So Varader or Havana doesn't need to be written too much.
Perhaps we should just remind you that the Hemingway estate already mentioned has a museum, and anyone who loves the writer should not miss visiting this museum.
Viňales Valley is one of the most picturesque parts of Cuba in the western part of the island.
Lewd vegetation grows out of lime.
Limestone formations, lime-mountain cones and rocks are rising steeply from the bottom of the valley and their cavities have accumulated fertile soil, which also covers the scattered cliffs with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where they may grow the highest quality Cuban tobacco.
Its final form can be found on a visit to one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that they filmed Major Zeman's Chilean episode there.
Trinidad
It is an ancient city founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spaniards.
The slave and sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy took shape in the beauty and monumentality of the not-so-great city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, which was significantly influenced by later French settlers, has changed almost nothing in four centuries.
Escambray is such a secluded place between the plains and the sea that even in the 50s of the last century, there were no roads connecting this region to the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped him to remain an outsider.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't tear it down, so everyone was happy to have a roof over their head.
If you have more than an afternoon on Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancon beach or the Valley of Sugar Factoryes.
In the evening it is fitting to go to Casa de la Música, which after dark awakens, where the music is quiet only in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in eastern Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion is already influenced by the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and divided mountains, and they pass through the nature of human activity which is almost barely affected.
Thanks to the untouched nature there, the Eastern Earth Language of Cuba has been added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO.
This is where the best chocolate is made, the church has Columbus' cross (in reality it was made a hundred years after Columbus sailing) and the hill where the former castle stood, and today the El Castillo hotel stands, some of which are tablet-mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
The coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Meastro plains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion, which the descendants of former slaves believe, can be written about.
I mean, as they say, it's better to see it once.
The Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claims the Americans
Few soldiers and the lack of equipment required influence the progress of the United States mission to Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up concrete plans for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as planned, and the leaders of the countries with units in the southern part of the country have agreed on an agreement in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban movement, the eight participating countries also discuss the further plans and coordination of the Allies.
While the United States, assisted by the Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to become more active this week, Britain considers the strengthening of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance as a priority.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the population to launch further development of the economy and security themselves," said British Defense Minister Des Browne to the BBC.
Ninety percent
The Afghan insurgents' activity has been the strongest in the last five years, according to the US government.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year and by 60 percent in Helmand's southern province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the south.
According to the United States, however, the Allies reached their limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, additional helicopters, soldiers and experts were asked to train Afghan troops.
"We really need to think about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them," řekl Gates.
Today Jaap de Hoop, the Secretary-General of NATO, spoke in a similar spirit.
"I don't like what's in Afghanistan on the ground and in the air.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters news agency at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out Passive
In recent months, there have also been discussions between the participating countries on whether all the allies in Afghanistan are reaching their maximum.
Germany, for example, was criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively large in Afghanistan.
However, they were deployed in areas where the least violence and combat requirements are thus not as high for them as they are for us in the south and east of the country," said Gates.
This week, the Sun British tabloid called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan slackers have been exposed: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," wrote the Sun in a photo of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild launched a counterattack and published a photo of a rugby match fought by a British team in southern Afghanistan.
Public debt reaches 1 trillion in 2009
There are 84,000 crowns of public debt for every Czech.
The total debt reached 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government plans to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to the better development of the state budget.
The Czech Republic's public debt reached 842.7 billion kroner at the end of September.
Over the nine months of this year, it's risen by 40.2 billion kroner.
From June, however, it fell by 13.4 billion kronor.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed today its debt data from early October.
Each Czech has more than 84,000 crowns in debt.
Last year, the state owed over 11 billion crowns.
"For the time being, thanks to the lower deficit next year, it seems that the one-billion crowned limit could only be exceeded in 2009.
The next year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said iHNed.cz, Patria Finance Analyst David Marek.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees this: "In 2009 we can cross a trillion.
The exact time depends on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it were proved that the political situation would change, politicians would be ready to save more, this could go further until 2010.
But I'm not assuming this change," he said.
Growth debt
Government debt consists of the central government’s debts, mainly due to the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
Public debt is financed by cashier’s notes, government loan bonds, direct loans or loans from, for example, the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal indebtedness has increased by 38,5 billion to 719,4 billion kroner this year.
The state's foreign debt has so far increased by 1.7 billion to 123.3 billion.
The so-called saleable government debt reached 803.3 billion kronor by the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion kronor from June onwards.
The average maturity of public debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The year-to-year debt rose by 13 percent in the first quarter, which is indeed quite a lot compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by loan bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt increases, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when the pension reform is here," commented Pikora on the data.
It's better than expected.
The financing strategy and the management of public debt in 2007 show that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion kroner this year.
By early December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion kroner due to the better development of the state budget.
The amount consists primarily of a deficit in the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion kronor instead of the supposed 91.3 billion kronor this year.
Furthermore, the maximum planned funding of the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds of 43 billion kroner and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion kroner.
The teacher will appear today in a court in Khartoum because of a name given to a teddy bear
On Thursday evening, a court in Khartoum sentenced the British teacher to 15 days in prison and expulsion from the country for violation of Islam in Sudan, said her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to name a teddy bear Muhammad. However, Islamic religion prohibits any representation of her prophet.
Such an act can be punished by whipping.
The 54-year-old British woman, teacher of the Unity High School in Khartoum, was arrested in her own apartment on Sunday. According to paragraph 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, she was accused of Islamic violations and rebellion after the parents of the students filed multiple complaints against her at the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students 6-7 years old to choose the name of the class teddy bear.
"The children proposed a total of eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Muhammad", says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, 20 out of 23 children chose Muhammad's first name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of the Islamic prophet, but he is also a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a common diary with the picture of the bear and the sign "My name is Mohamed".
The problem lies in the fact that any representation of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues at the same school said that he knew her well, and that the teacher would never have done anything to violate any religious belief. He said that it was just an "innocent mistake": "I'm only sorry that she had the kids vote the name."
Many students of the teacher agree with this opinion. According to them, the teacher is "very good with children" and "never talks about religion in class".
Let us not forget that Muhammad is also the second most popular first name in Britain, and there are 14 different spellings in English.
This first name, so often chosen by Muslim families, is one way of expressing respect for the prophet. (Often this name is given to the firstborn child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can this name be given to a game, for example?
It's obviously a question of interpretation.
No agreement was reached at the last Vienna hearing on Wednesday on the future status of the province.
The end result is failure.
The sixth and last discussion between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians on the future status of the Separatist province ended without any convergence in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning.
"It is regrettable that the parties did not reach an agreement on status," said EU diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger at a Vienna press conference.
The US Ambassador Frank Wisner stressed that peace in the region was at stake and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises of maintaining peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"There will be no fear of violence in the near future, but there will be a very difficult period", he added, stressing the "presence of obvious tensions".
The broadcast ends on December 10th.
On Monday, a broker troika, including the European Union, the United States of America and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time.
The future of the 90 percent Albanian province can be clarified after Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Bocan-Harckenko submit their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The debate in Baden, near Vienna, marked the sixth and last meeting of the negotiations since the UN mandated the Troika to broadcast again last August.
The Americans and Europeans consider their mediation task to be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked Kosovo's independence in the Security Council, are insisting that negotiations continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was and will remain committed to the negotiated solution, along with the compromise," said Bocan-Harcshenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years under the direction of the UN, Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina has stated that she is prepared to declare her independence unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in her favor.
Belgrade would continue to promote greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we failed to reach an agreement", announced the president of the independent province of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where "the last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the uprising in Kosovo and the future prime minister of the province, also expressed his regret.
He added, however, that Belgrade's idea of autonomy would be "a continuation of the past that has led to murders and deportations".
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic believed that the compromise was still possible, and the majority of Kosovo's Albanians were warned about the consequences of the unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is afraid of a domino effect in an unstable region due to the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise," Tadic said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation reiterated that the decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the final word"
"Only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"The negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end in the same place they began: the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu told journalists that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word". He added that the unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians was based on "conciliation" with the Western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine
President George Bush announced on Tuesday, at the opening of his international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
Bush said that the Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to enter into negotiations without delay for a final settlement of 60 years of debate between their peoples.
Bush promised in the presence of the two presidents that he would support them in every way possible to sign the "peace treaty" in 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians have to eliminate the "terrorist networks" and Israel has to abandon its colonial activity, said Bush, and reminded the two parties of their obligations with regard to the "peace schedule" adopted in 2003.
The leader of the White House stressed that the purpose of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas and Israel was to "sign a peace treaty with which all pending problems, including central issues, will be resolved".
The latter concern three sensitive problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees displaced from their homes during the conflict in 1948, who lived in the territory of today's Israeli state.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations should be "global and profound" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, national borders, colonies, water and security".
After that, Olmert, who took the stand, promised that the future negotiations would be "direct and continuous", and he would strive for their "end in 2008".
Bush set out by the end of 2008 the implementation of the "vision of two states" that existed side by side in Palestine and Israel.
Saudi Arabia said that it had been promised by Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia (with Washington's involvement as a success in Annapolis) initiated a plan with the support of all Arab countries to guarantee peace for Israel in exchange for withdrawing from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is "an answer to the history of the Middle East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on the central issues", says the Saudi prince in his interview with the Saudi-owned Arab newspaper.
The D.A. says the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As usual with such news, official positions and rumours contradict each other.
How did the accident happen?
According to the first data of the investigation initiated by the General Police Inspection Body (IGPN), a police car was driving on Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, a few minutes after 17.
"The car was patrolling, so it wasn't involved in an operation. It was traveling at a speed of 40, 50 km/h without sirening," we learned from police sources.
The young man without two helmets "at high speed" was driven by a green, "not on the official record, so it cannot be used on the road" (see below) with a Kawasaki-branded engine.
"Because they didn't follow the right hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a policeman.
The alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
It shows the strength of the impact that the front of the car dented, the windscreen cracked like a star, and the bumper snapped.
Pontoise's state's attorney, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced yesterday in an extraordinary announcement that he entrusted IGPN and the Val-D'Oise County Public Security Directorate with the investigation "for failure to commit manslaughter and assistance."
During the afternoon, the prosecutor said at a press conference that the responsibility of the police at this stage of the IGPN investigation could be ruled out.
According to the prosecutor, the three witnesses of the accident interviewed on Sunday night confirmed "the police report that the scooter arrived relatively quickly from the left side of the police car".
Last night, from a strip drawn by the footholds in the street, it was shown that the two vehicles were collapsing and moving together for a while until the police car was able to stop it.
Vehicles have been impounded for technical testing.
The body of the two victims was examined yesterday by a medical examiner.
What happened immediately after that?
Yesterday, word spread like wildfire in Villiers-le-Bel, saying that the police left the scene quickly without any help from the two youths.
In this regard, IGPN is cautious, but it excludes the police from making "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires a more thorough investigation and, in the course of this, special caution," we learned from police sources.
Liberia met with a witness who reported on the minutes after the accident.
One of the windows in his apartment looks right at the scene.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, immediately went down to try to revive them," says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a policeman who was completely confused and limping.
The other two tried to revive one of the young, and the fourth called."
There was growing tension among those present, as the hopeless situation of the two youths became evident, so the incoming police drove their colleagues off the scene.
We also know from the witness's statement that the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left."
They also used compressions, but it didn't work.
"I wouldn't say the police weren't trying to help the young.
Young people did get help.
Fire department arrived at the scene immediately.
They did everything they could to save them," said the prosecutor.
There's an increase in tension in Pakistan.
On Monday, the Pakistani police stopped the first demonstrations of the state of emergency introduced two days earlier by General Musarraf.
According to eyewitnesses, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against emergency measures in the eastern part of the country, Lahore, were injured by tear gas bombs used by law enforcement forces.
In response, they threw stones at the police, many of whom were injured.
They've got at least 350 lawyers.
Similar events took place in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked the lawyers and wounded them.
They've made more than one person.
In Islamabad, registered attorneys at the Supreme Court called for a general strike and protests were announced for the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers on the weekend.
On Monday morning, in order to prevent the assembly, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed.
There were several demonstrations in Multan and Peshawar in the northwest, central part of the country.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has been supported by the huge Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance of religious parties. "The leader encouraged the people to send flowers to judges who disagree with the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore an oath to Musarraf."
"Musarraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly concerned by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court should declare the legality of President Musarraf's re-election on 6 October in indirect voting in the coming days.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed from office and replaced.
"Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings," said the president to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf said that he would leave the army to become civilian president, and that after the state of emergency was introduced, the Deputy Minister for Information, Tariq Azeem, announced on Monday.
Musarraf had to give up the military uniform until 15 November, i.e. until the end of his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the January elections.
The Pakistani government also refuted the rumor that President Musarraf would have been appointed a forced residence as Deputy General.
More than one third of pregnancies are not intended
This results in unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Even today, more than one third (36%) of pregnancies are not planned, according to the study of the French National Institute of Demographics (Ined), 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Law, which liberalises contraception.
This results in unwanted (24%) or inadequate or unplanned pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablets or uterine spirals, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception made "birth control" more effective. The study notes that only 5% of women between 20 and 44 years of age took birth control pills in 1970, but today it is 60%.
Today, 8 out of 10 pregnancies are planned.
Every fifth is planning with a few months' accuracy, and if possible, by spring, as this is the most favorable season for the child to receive.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and the International Space Station (ISS) crew had to work more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of the broken solar panel essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous spacewalk has proved to be a record in many ways: the repair took a very long time, very little time to plan it, and it had to be done with tools "made" by astronauts away from the residential modules.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts separated Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylindrical element that will soon be the site of scientific laboratory activities in Europe and Japan (see box).
This module is a kind of gateway to the laboratory modules.
However, their power supply must be provided.
The second task of the crew was to transfer one of the modules producing electricity with the help of the 17.5 tonnes solar panels, which had already been on the ISS, to its final location.
Then the crew began to open the solar panels of the module 76 meters wide.
From the harmonically foldable boards, one of them was damaged by a cable that was stuck about 1 meter in length.
To avoid further damage, the tablet was not opened.
The astronauts were originally supposed to take a check-up walk from the Discovery shuttle and then repair another solar panel with a malfunctioning system. Instead, they had to devote all their time to repair the damaged solar panel.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt hanging from his 30-meter robot arm attached to the space shuttle's crane at the station.
He's one of NASA's best space walkers.
He's tall, he's strong, he's extremely skilled, he's got a muscular upper body and a long arm.
The 46-year-old man with a doctor's degree had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After a thorough assessment of the damage, he cut the faulty cable and fixed the damaged area with a few "rails".
In his work, he was assisted by another "space walker" who stayed close to the safe passageway, as well as from inside by other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick, which was insulated against hundreds of volts of solar panels, was invented by the astronauts of the station and "knitted" it together.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until his companions fully opened the board and then packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took a half-day break, and today, seven of them returned to Discovery Space Shichlor to begin their planned return home on Wednesday.
EADS shares price decrease
The exchange rate of EADS shares in the Paris Stock Exchange fell sharply after the company producing aircraft and security equipment announced that the delay in the development of the A400M aircraft would result in an additional cost of EUR 1.2-1.4 billion.
The rate of EADS shares is currently EUR 21.96 after a 4% fall.
The company was forced to review its forecasts for the 2007 operating result, as the development of the A400M engine is running late, which obviously means that the aircraft will also be delivered later.
The delay in the transfer of the military carrier aircraft, which was announced in October, will cost between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion, of which over EUR 1 billion is affected by Airbus', announced the parent company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the occurrence of these expenditures, the EADS will have to provide new planning figures for its 2007 operating result next Thursday when it announces its quarterly results, the company added, but no further figures were provided.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimate.
In 2006, EADS' operating results decreased by 86%: this was largely due to delays in the development of another programme, the A380 giant machine, which also had a huge financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Staying on the status quo
Sunday elections do not offer much surprise: the vast majority of Russians will vote for Putin's party, the Unified Russia.
This shows the Russian's need for stability, perhaps arbitrary government, after a heavily manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian head Vladimir Putin uses the public service channels to send a television message to the electorate, which has already been recorded, but its content is still secret.
Putin is leading the candidate list of the Kremlin support party, the Unified Russia, which is expected to win an overwhelming victory in the elections.
In yesterday’s capture of foreign ambassadors, the head of state’s conduct did not reveal anything: only another outburst against the interventions of Western countries, which was a popular topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy, so we want honest, absolutely transparent and open elections, without any violation," he added.
According to the opposition, however, this is far from the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign in which they consider the voters to have been pressured.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zjuganov, claims that "there was no such dirty choice in Russia even in the time of Yeltsin".
After the defeat of last weekend's protests, former World Chess Champion Garri Kasparov was sentenced to five days in prison for an unauthorised protest, and his lawyer claims he can't visit.
"The Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus'"
The predictable election results raise two more obvious questions:
Who's following Putin in the head of state?
Yesterday, the date of the first round of the presidential election was published in the official paper, which will be 2 March 2008 and the candidates will be able to indicate their intention to run by 23 December.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate can no longer be extended.
There's no other offspring on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play in March?
You're going to be Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as the leader of the all-powerful united Russia party and the parliamentary majority?
Either way, the outgoing power triumphs in both parliamentary and presidential elections.
It's become a tradition now.
"The Russians still think like 'homo sovieticus': they do not feel able to control their fate," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada center.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of St. Petersburg, goes even further: according to his theory, the country became a Christian five hundred years later than Europe, so the development of civil society is also delayed.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin went back to the paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. All the more so, since this new form of paternalism did not involve intimidation, but with certain economic prosperity", says Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "reject personal responsibility of their own accord", which was quickly manifested after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all sectors of society, including the business world.
The administrative elite is interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Unified Russia are led by 65 governors, who come out of the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West often embodies chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extremist parties.
Tamara Cserednychenko 54-year-old teacher concludes: "Why should we think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why should we replace them?"
Repressive Memories
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive became public, documenting the fate of 17 and a half million victims of the Hitler regime.
The 47 million archive documents, which occupy 27 kilometres of shelves in Bad Arolsen, in Hessen Province, have so far only been researchable for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. they have only given unique and name-based access to the former victims or their descendants.
In May 2006, eleven states - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed to open the archives for researchers and historians.
After all states ratified the treaty, the archive was opened yesterday.
Confidential information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Archives allows historians to carry out research on "the relocation of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the publication of documents because they contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deported victims may be one of these.
The lists of concentration camps and the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo began to be collected for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to search for civilians deported or sentenced to forced labour and possibly provide evidence of their internment, which allowed them to receive compensation.
More than 300 permanent workers in Bad Arolsen are currently processing tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some of the community of scientists do not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be of paramount importance.
"These documents basically contain nothing new," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Research Centre of the Technical University of Berlin on Anti-Semitism in 2006.
EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008
The annual turnover of indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion.
The EU is India's leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, said European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and Indian Minister for Trade Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers already approved in April last year that the European Commission should open negotiations for the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's leading trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also India's main foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th most important trading partner, according to the European Commission's figures.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement for both parties could have an economic recovery effect" and "India could increase its presence in a prosperous market with 450 million inhabitants".
Europe is the primary or secondary importer of the ten most important products exported by India, the Commissioner added. Every year, the two giants, Europe and Asia, will exchange "EUR 47 billion worth of products" and "EUR 10 billion of services" with each other, said Danièle Smád, Head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi this week. However, he regretted the fact that bilateral trade has "still not reached its full potential". EU and India will meet in New Delhi on Friday in the framework of the Eighth Diplomatic Summit, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President José Manuel Durao Barroso of the European Commission.

Responding to concerns: Bank of England offers £10 billion to the financial market for a five-week term
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the concern about credit conditions, and therefore announced on Thursday that it will pump 10 billion pounds into the money market, which will be made available at a basic rate of 5,75 % and, unlike usual, five weeks' worth.
"We want to alleviate the concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like the banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered on the international financial market in a five-week open market operation from 6 December", states the Bank's press release.
According to the bank, £10 billion (14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 local time. The offer is subject to the central bank interest rate and the repayment deadline is 10 January.
This is the first time the Bank of England has issued liquid funds for five weeks in an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In its press release, the Bank of England added that it is "ready to take further measures" in order to align interbank loans with the central bank base rate.
The current interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate exceeded the level of 18 September: currently it stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has charged a significant penalty rate on the amounts pumped into the financial market, which has deterred banks from using them.
According to the rumor, many would have preferred the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been obtained with better interest and greater discretion, if only strengthened by the exchange rate of the pound compared to the euro.
UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text discussed at the meeting initiated by the Socialists included about ten measures, which were adopted by the National Office of the Socialist Party on Tuesday, including, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance, a return to variable fuel tax, the introduction of a travel cheque and the limitation of rents.
As UMP and NC voted 180:115 against the examination of the articles, the discussion between the governing party and the opposition, sometimes in sharp arguments, ended only a few hours before President Nicolas Sarkozy's television speech on purchasing power.
The head of the socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that all of his group's proposals will be re-submitted in the framework of the amendment to the corrective financial bill, which will be on the Parliament's agenda next week.
A new festival is born
A number of rumours were circulated about the new Philadelphia music festival to be held by C3 Presents. However, now the company organizing and promoting the event announced that the Vineland music festival will be held in New Jersey in cooperation with Melvin Benn, a British producer, the Festival Republic.
"It is an honor for us to work with a man who is the starter of today's American festival movement," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 also organizes the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits music festival.
The Vineland festival in New Jersey will be held in summer, so there will be a possibility of camping.
The festival will take place between 8 and 10 August in a private area of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the most respected festival organizers in the world.
In 1989 he started organizing the British Reading Festival, which attracts about 80 000 visitors every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn further expanded his palette by organizing the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 Festival Republic launched the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival's production, licensing and organizational tasks.
C3 co-worker Charlie Jones called the Glastonbury Festival the "most inspiring event" he ever attended. He added that his company and Melvin Benn work together to enrich the region with a European-style festival event.
"We have selected the Philadelphia site before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we have worked hard to organize this festival in the center of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We have been working with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, however, because of the political maneuvers of the city administration, the organisation failed," continued Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing to host a huge festival at another unique location, which ultimately serves the interests of the people of Philadelphia."
The C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, after proving its exceptional festival organizer talent with the Austin City Limits music festival in 2002.
The gross income of the two events amounted to $9.8 million and $11.3 million in 2007.
Both festivals were held at urban locations.
"Melvin Benn's European concept is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and create both the European rural atmosphere and the urban feeling of America."
Vineland is located between Philadelphia and Atlantic City about halfway.
"Vineland's population and even the mayor himself are enthusiastically supportive of the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow investment in an event of this size at a place which hopefully will host the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be "giant" in size, and its capacity will be roughly equal to the capacity of the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee for 80 000 people.
The bands have already been invited to the event, but nothing is final at the time of the press release.
"Vineland is basically going to be a rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offerings so that everyone can find something to please," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and two of his partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Att, form C3, which received the award of the latest Billboard Touring Award.
Montreal's up against the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure Hollywood directors to Montreal if you have to fight the Terminator himself...
"Seduction" is one of the tasks of the Montreal delegate.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight the "Verminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful because the film industry decides which is the best place for it.
If you find the conditions in Montreal favorable, that's where you'll go.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions for us to decide on," says Schwarzenegger.
Competition for Festivals
Denis Turcotte, however, is now focusing mainly on promoting Canadian films.
Because the competition for the Oscars has begun.
The aim is to present and promote as many films as possible in Quebec at every American film festival, whether Sundance Film Festival, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a positive reception at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
In January it will also be screened at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake Hands with the Devil is also presented at Santa Monica and the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also made four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-the-year rally on the stock market? Experts share the opinion of the subprime crisis
Just five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have been rubbing their hands and looking forward to the usual end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the experts whether this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "statistically speaking, in December the stock market usually behaves positively.
However, forecasts with a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, and even in the current situation the market is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the short term".
Experts do not support the end-of-year roll-out of the stock market, although they state that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this is an opportunity to invest, as there are no guaranteed alternatives, in particular fixed returns, which are negatively affected by escape to quality securities, both in the long term and in the short term".
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will be characterised by a more lateral movement which is not free of volatility, "mainly because the impact of the Fed interest rate reduction is not yet known, because the price of crude oil is high and inflationary is also at risk".
Javier Barrio, the sales manager of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means he believes it would be risky to declare that there will be rally.
According to the expert, "it's not at all rosy."
Ibex's loss is almost 4 percent compared to the highest levels recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7.
Nevertheless, not all experts are so pessimistic.
According to Intermoney analyst Juan Solana, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16,000 due to the reorganisation of the wallets and the payments to the usual pension fund.
On the other hand, the expert adds that there will be some change this year, as the rally will be postponed to the second week of December, the week after the long weekend of the Festival of Constitution.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, we are close to the technical level and "because of this, we are experiencing a fall in the stock market index, which may also increase depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be favorable.
Analysts agree which securities will be intended to reach the new maximum quotas for Ibex.
Solana, from Intermoney, emphasizes that "this year it's on big securities."
The expert would add the two major banks and a few construction companies to the list, "since the electric sector will be very expensive by then".
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the increase is due to the banking sector and the industrial sector.
The rally can also be positive for building companies, if at all.
"ACS has been trying to regain its positions for several months and we hope that Ferrovial and FCC construction companies will follow it on this road," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main player for the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies can also benefit, although there is not too much representation on the Spanish market in this area.
Five times in seven years.
In the last seven years, only two fall occurred in December.
The real year-end rally was observed in 2003, when the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the bursting of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 percent, a 6,68% jump was recorded in December.
So it is still open whether 2007 will be the fifth year of profit in a row (in a moment, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether the end rally can take place.
Banco Popular Español 200 opens a 12-hour account from Monday to Saturday
Banco Popular Español has decided to renovate most of its accounts.
This concerns a total of 200 branches located in the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These branches run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference for the bank.
But also for the other Spanish institutions, because this is the first group whose branches are open regularly until 20.30 p.m. and even on Saturday from 10:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it plans to extend the opening hours of its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
But he's just about to come to an agreement with the unions that he'd close 75% of his accounts in exchange for opening up an afternoon, though not for the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español will be crucial for the other institutions, as this will enable them to decide whether to join the initiative to promote more favourable business openings.
This is precisely the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, I would like to target shopping individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate its 200 branches throughout Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned opening hours, as it is not a new opening order, but a restructuring of the existing ones.
To do this, the institution modernises its branches in commercial areas according to the needs of customers on each street.
In this way, the extension of the opening hours is accompanied by a new concept of the nature of the branches, a more modern and colorful design.
Commercial banks responsible Ángel Rivera points out that restructuring does not require a large investment, but they have to employ more employees, which means eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
Branches, including negotiators for SMEs, will also sell non-financial products.
Favourable Experiences
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three branches in Madrid.
According to Ángel Rivero, the experience was positive.
Branches on Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid were chosen, and Rivero said that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2,500 accounts.
Another 60 operate under the name Mundocredit, specialises in immigrants, and also has a very favorable opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these units of PopularMax, BBVA is not used, where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles the stock exchange value of its rival Antena 3
"We did it."
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, a consultant at Telecinco, expressed satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the market, when it turned out that the TV station he ran doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Yet one thing overshadowed his joy: "It only hurts that it is not because we have risen more, but because we have fallen less", he said.
Even so, he placed great emphasis on the fact that in the weak market we "falled less".
Telecinco closed yesterday at 2.54 percent.
This increase puts its annual loss to 15.66 percent.
52 percent of the company is owned by Mediaset, 13 percent by Vocento, thus its stock exchange value is EUR 4.488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Rivala, Antena 3, lost 1.52 percent yesterday, and since January, it has recorded a 40.5% drop, so yesterday it was worth half as much as 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million for Sogecable; 2.518.53 million for Prisa (published by Cinco Días) and 1.779 million for Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the similarity between the two companies.
The question is how much we can achieve in the same market, at what cost, and how this will be repaid in terms of ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it would like to be the first TV channel in excess of 1 billion gross advertising revenue this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña.
If the reported fact is fulfilled, the TV channel would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6 percent this financial year compared to the 965.4 million booked in the financial year 2006.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 percent in the first nine months of the financial year (i.e. 734,4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 percent (630.4 million).
According to analysts, one of the factors that trigger Telecinco's stock market momentum is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company led by President Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
According to Vasile, although it is too early to decide, this ratio may change after buying 33% of Endemol, together with Mediaset, its parent company.
"We are officially guaranteeing payment of 50% minimum, although we have always allocated much more.
I hope our shareholders will be satisfied with us this year, as we have already favored them with the acquisition of 33 percent of Endemol".
According to analysts, the market is currently characterised by a slight slowdown.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 percent in 2008 and 7 percent in 2009.
According to them, this is due to the estimated growth in turnover falling from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same company's forecasts, Antena 3's profits will decrease by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecures: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high profitability and long-term sustainable potential of dividends.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is more favourable (buying) than Antena 3 (maintenance) due to its "multiple attractiveness" and business strengthening.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases it recommends underweighting because of the "similar risks" (saturated market and less favourable economic climate).
Congress approves the takeover of MiFID, which took effect on November 1.
In parallel to the parliamentary process, which ended today with the congressional vote approving the Senate's amendments, the government initiated a social dialogue on the legislation on which the law was based, so that both could enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of different groups consistently highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to develop the most favourable normative for investor protection and to regulate the activities of firms in order to operate effectively on the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows financial markets to be modernised, while strengthening investor protection, broadening the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities and Markets Committee (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new directive allows financial advisory services for specialised firms, but also for natural or legal persons, as well as for securities distribution companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to establish a new form of financial services company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFIs).
In addition, the law increases the number of systems capable of carrying out operations involving funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current exchange participants.
In addition, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide market information on the decisive aspects, risk-taking and risk-management methods of their business profile and to keep records of all operations carried out in order to facilitate the control of the CNMV.
The Congress Economic Committee has tabled a number of amendments, of which it is of paramount importance that securitised debts are treated as "complex" funds, due to the high risk to the investor, which has been confirmed in connection with high-risk mortgage lending in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the transposition of the directive was also used to legally outline the scope of the activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship qualifications, which was implemented 30 years after the entry into force in 1977 of the Royal Decree defining the professional functions which can only be performed by economists.
And the Senate has proposed the creation of new players in the financial sector, such as the broker's agent, who works for another account, does not need CNMV's permission, and can market products or acquire customers for more than one investor company at the same time.
The Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and reached 4.1%.
This indicator, which Eurostat takes into account for the calculation of the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
Its disclosure is in line with Eurostat and the European Central Bank's strategy to provide data comparable to those from the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
For the preliminary indicator, the same calculation method is used as for the calculation of the Unified Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs to assess the information that is not yet available at the time of disclosure.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator was purely for information and could therefore derogate from the final data, which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Economic Affairs, stated that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November is only "temporary", but at the same time indicated that the price index is expected to show a " relatively high" value in the coming months.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less at the same level within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November brought "less surprises" than the previous month, when the Government did not expect such a great increase.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%" was acknowledged by the Minister for Economic Affairs in relation to the data published today.
Northern Rock makes Virgin want to make 42 billion euros in three years.
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50% and currently only GBP 12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since the crisis took place in mid-September and had to borrow urgent loans from the Bank of England.
At that time, it had a record number of deposits of more than £25 billion, the number of which gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to the loss of client confidence, despite the government's promise of a hundred percent guarantee to the bank until the end of the crisis.
Virgin will run this unit under its own financial and commercial name, Virgin Money, and Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the British banks' revenues over the next three years to get the remaining £18 billion and reach the 30 billion target.
Richard Branson, a prominent businessman known for his impressive advertising campaigns in England, intends to spend some 50 million pounds a year (i.e. 70 million euros) on advertising and marketing in order to achieve the goal set.
Northern Rock highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium this week as the best way to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Gendarmerie arrested the mayor (Popular Party) of the village of Totana in Murcia Province at dawn this morning, as he was suspected of being involved in an urban corruption scandal this week.
Other than him, they arrested a city hall secretary and the city chief.
The former city council member José Martínez Andreo took over the post of the EPP representative Juan Morales in May, who, according to the official bodies consulted by the SER radio channel, could be the head of the corruption network.
The police continue to investigate the city's offices and the City Development Council, and it cannot be ruled out that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also investigated as the main suspect in this week's corruption scandal.
According to SER radio station information, the pro-popular Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested when he left Morales with the corruption documentation in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission Morales received in exchange for signing a town development agreement with a Galician construction company on the reclassification of 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently under arrest.
Bono accepts the nomination of PSOE in Toledo and his office as President of Parliament if they win the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted the offer by the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE in Toledo in the next parliamentary elections and to fill Parliament's presidency if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE Secretary José Blanci at a press conference and Bono himself confirmed by the party's federal headquarters today after a meeting with Zapatero at noon.
The head of government justified his election to the former minister by saying that "we have to deal with the best in politics" and Bono is among the best."
In addition, he added that "probably" the Mancha politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for Parliament's presidency if the Socialists win the upcoming elections.
Mr Bono would replace the current parliamentary president, Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he did not intend to run for office in the next elections and would rather fight against climate change in scientific circles by giving up his political career.
The former Minister admitted that the Head of Government had constantly besieged him to return to the political scene since he abandoned active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the electorate is aware of who will be the economic vice-president in the event of the victory of the Socialists, the party also wanted to inform them of who will be President of Parliament in the spirit of "transparency".
If Bono is really going to fill the post, he would like Parliament to be "the scene of respect and not insults or shouting" and to be more like the home of citizens.
"At times, unfortunately, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where there is no peace of mind to talk, and the speech of the Head of Government has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he praised the current president Manuel Marín, his "excellent work", but he did not want to make himself president so that his opponents would not consider him "supervisor".
Campaign for Climate
Since the movement that promotes climate change relentlessly persecutes both skeptical ones and those who prefer political or social battles, it must be very strong.
In fact, you need to bring along a political leader like the Head of Government Zapatero, who believes that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and declares that "we must enter into a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this remark raises the question of the extent to which the activity or inactivity of its government has contributed to the fact that Spain is at the forefront of non-compliance with the Kyoto Convention within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why has the Government not sought to avoid this?
It should also clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, what habits should the population change, what energy savings should we expect at individual and social level, and what economic consequences will this have?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we have neither received nor will we be given an explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
The measures taken by climate changes, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the public.
Even the increase in PSOE gas prices would have been so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrew it.
That is to say, we must save Earth from nothing, merely propaganda texts, empty passwords without actual consequences.
With conventions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so beautifully in the election campaign, he does not demand, do not attack, or even embellish election meetings and gives us tenderness.

The mayor and chief of police of Totana were arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Gendarmerie arrested the Mayor of Totana, the People's Party José Martínez Andreo, the local Commissioner, the City Hall secretary, and a catering business operator for crimes related to urban development, were informed today by police sources.
The mayor was arrested in his home and then transferred to City Hall, and he is presently with several police officers, many of whom are investigating the City Development Council and the municipal body responsible for the management of the Industries and Houses.
Last Monday, the three arrests were preceded by the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on a case where 2 hectares of agricultural land was converted into land that could be built to permit the construction of 4000 apartments for Nuaria, Galicia, after illegal commissions were paid to the managers during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation, as informed by the Court of Justice in Totana 1.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court.
According to official sources, the former mayor of Totana is Juan Morales, who is now an independent Member of the People's Party in Parliament.
The ex-wife, who owns a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also being investigated, as is the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in Murcia's provincial center.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.A lawyer and contractor, were arrested in Nigran (Pontevedra), together with the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, Pablo José M.G. The latter company is also part of the Nuaria Group and the bribes were carried out through him.
The investigation is carried out by a group of Gendarmerie Operative Central Unit responsible for crimes committed at municipal level, whose members held eleven search warrants in addition to arrests, mainly for companies associated with arrests operating in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
The only person arrested in Totana was the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area who could have played an intermediary role in the case.
The Nuaria Group would have created the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the settlement with 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Conycase, which is responsible for managing the parking lot of Coruna, Venezuela and Catholic Ferdinand Square in Vigo, specialising in direct marketing, Hogartel and Preconiza, selling, promotion and installation of building elements.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month and see if we can learn some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.
I've already got one installed.
People, life is a constant change.
Of course, everyone can come up with something.

Our Finnish correspondent found this commentary in one of the largest daily newspapers in Finland: (certainly at the head of the PISA report on the world level of culture), in Helsingin Sanomat, referring to what appeared on 18 November at the same time as the review of Blackburn's book.
"The philosophical teachings were presented to the public after the tragedy of Jokela High School.
The killer quoted Plato and Nietzsche in the messages of a student who was about to graduate.
The Education Councillor Pekka Elo, who was responsible for teaching philosophy, demanded that teachers examine Plato's teachings with a critical eye on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat daily newspaper, and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important in the mandatory basic philosophy classes of high schools".

One of your colleagues informs us that the Criminal Code contains a misdemeanor of Internet downloads:
A. Downloading a song is considered a misdemeanor and punishable from six months to one year.
However, if you steal disks with a value of less than 400 euros in a store, it's a violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal 1000 euros in a store, stealing is a misdemeanor, but the penalty still does not reach the level of penalty that can be imposed on Internet downloads (Art. 234 BTK).
C. If you steal a car but return it in 40 hours, the penalty still does not reach the level of the penalty that can be imposed on Internet downloads (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you're in a fight than you're copying CDs.
If you are involved in a mass struggle, you will be punished from three months to one year (Art. 154 BTK) but from six months to two years for copying the CD disk
(Art. 270 BTK).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment in the workplace is not as serious as downloading a DVD film.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the author's consent is more punishable than the sale of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
If my colleague's right, someone's out of control.

My doctor gave me an article on strange research, entitled "Money causes brain activity, especially if the others have less."
So the employees' feelings on payday depend on how much the others got.
The experiment was conducted at Bonn University by tomography of magnetic resonances, and the results were published in the latest issue of Science.
The author of the study and the head of the Neurocognition Group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant responded correctly, but his partner made a mistake".
Researchers found that if both of them had given the correct answer and received the same amount of money, the brain activity was moderate, but if one of them had received a double dose, the activity was also intensified.
I have no idea why it took such a great science to make such a simple conclusion.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals from the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Court of the Hague and the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate expires at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a slightly bitter taste in her mouth, as they are responsible for the massacre in Srebrenica, during which 8000 Bosnian Muslims were slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and the Bosnian leader Radovan Karajics are still at large.
Their names are on the list chosen by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, not yet presented in Spain). The film follows the work of the Swiss Attorney General from Belgrade to New York as he tries to put pressure on the governments involved to encroach on the fugitives.
What kind of insurance is that for me?
Motor insurance, which provides safety to the owner of the car with significant costs and depends on several factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a driving licence, marital status, type of car to be insured and nature of use.
Getting a car is just the first step.
In fact, choosing the right insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car you want.
First of all, we need to know what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurance undertaking.
This agreement takes the form of an insurance contract which states that the insurance company undertakes to compensate for the fixed insurance premium in the event of an accident.
The insurance premium is essentially the amount paid for insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, gender, date of obtaining a licence, marital status, type of car to be insured, use of it, and more.
Insurance companies determine insurance premiums on the basis of statistics, i.e. higher amounts are paid by those who present a higher accident risk.
That is why women over the age of 25 or pay less, because statistics show that they pose less risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the statements, insurance companies concluded that married people cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
For the type of use of the car, the frequency is the most important one.
The possibility of an accident increases when used more frequently.
A number of factors are taken into account when setting the premium.
Therefore, the owner should look closely into choosing the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
In the following, we present the most important factors for the choice, in order to best adapt to the needs of the insured person and to establish an acceptable price.
When concluding an insurance contract, people under the age of 25 have a number of disadvantages, such as lack of driving experience and the freshness of the driving licence.
Although it is ideal to be insured against all dangers, there are also more economical solutions.
Precautionary managers can make full insurance with themselves, so they will be insured against all dangers and the price will be affordable.
For this type of contract, the insured person pays part of the damage.
"The amount of the contribution payable by the insured depends on the insurance premium; the higher the premium, the lower the share," says Luis Noguera, head of the Internet insurance intermediary of First Europe in Spain.
Another option is to extend liability insurance to third parties when the client is insured against damage to others, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, you will be insured against theft, fire damage and the loss of the car.
A word of advice.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents, as this will affect the bonus and you can reduce the amount to be paid in the future.
Bonuses are referred to as discounts in relation to the basic tariff of the insurance company.
The penalty imposed in relation to the basic tariff is called a raspberry.
"The bonus and the amount of raspberry depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonus rate," explains Noguera.
If they have already exceeded the age of 25, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to the experience gained over the years.
Then we advise you to make a full insurance policy with yourself.
"In general, young people are not yet able to properly apply their experience in an accident or even when driving," says the Spanish director of the European insurance company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of management, when the drivers have already exceeded the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married but has no children yet, it is best to take out full insurance, of course, if his financial options allow it.
Insurance companies consider married couples with children to be the least risky customers, and therefore the fee to be paid is lower in their case.
In this case, it is best to have full insurance (up to EUR 300) or, if they have a higher bonus, to extend the insurance to damage to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They drive more calmly, but at the same time they have more purchasing power and can afford to increase their own share," confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, we offer full insurance (around EUR 150) or, in the case of a higher bonus, it can be extended to cover liability.
Car insurance is a very important thing, not only because it provides protection to the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a big expense, so it is essential that we properly choose a personalised form of insurance.
Celtic wants to score in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic collate their strength at San Siro Stadium on Tuesday to get the missing point at the closing of the Champions League. Italians can be first in line and Scots can qualify.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round they have secured their passage with a tie against Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but it would take another one to prevent the six-point Shahktar, who will fight the four-point Benfica.
The two matches of Group D will be held a week before the end of the sixth round, as Milán will have to play in Japan at the World Club Championship, where on the 13th she will try to reach the 16th final in the semifinal.
With this, Group D will be finished sooner than others, and although the most likely result in Giuseppe Meazza Stadium will be the tie, the two teams will try to win, since the Italians do not want to be left behind at home, and Celtic will be the first place to start in the eighth final.
Even the defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify if the Shahktar doesn't win, but you can't be sure of that, because if there's an equal score, the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) won the next fight (2-0).
The Italians will try to make the evening of the Scots bitter, who would like to be in the eighth final of the reorganized Champions League twice in a row, after the previous season they scored a goal from the Rooster in the post-0 tie extension (1-0).
The victory of "Rossonerik" would be most appreciated by the Shahktar, because if the Celtic loses the eighth final and stays in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, despite being in the last place at the moment and not a chance of remaining in the European Championship, can still win the third place with a win to play in UEFA.
20,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
The Spice Girls started their tour in Vancouver, Canada, and they have performed in front of 20,000 viewers for the first time since they disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) at the GM Place in Vancouver announced that the band was "in great form".
Some 20,000 people switched tickets to be at the concert, where a video was presented in the 1990s, and it was a huge success in the history of the band.
Along with the regrouping of the band and the tour, EMI launched a new album in Spain, featuring the bigger hits and two new songs "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of Spice Girls performed in a bracelet from their husband, "Posh Spice", the British football player David Beckham.
The athlete was also in the crowded auditorium of GM Place, although a few days earlier Victoria banned him.
When the performance was announced, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star had "never seen our dress before, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', there was a reason why the band disbanded two years after leaving the band in 1998 'because the members didn't understand each other.' He also seemed nervous during the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw how people's feelings for Spice Girls changed.
I thought, why not? Now I am glad that I decided so," said Chisholm about the band, which was disbanded nine years earlier because of him.
The singer also added that "things have settled and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the last time Spice Girls performed in 1998.
According to CTV television, the band arrived in Vancouver on Virgin Airlines' own plane.
They had a bunch of baby-sitters waiting for them at the airport.
Five of them have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They're performing in Madrid on December 23rd.
More fears about the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute
There has been a renewed gas price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is transferred through Ukraine and disputes between the two nations are always being followed by great attention.
Kiev stated that if Moscow increases the gas price to be paid by the Ukrainians, they will also be charged with higher transit costs to Russia.
As a result of an earlier debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries have fallen.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow concerns the attempt to conclude an agreement between the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom, which was the subject of the gas price to be paid by Ukraine to Russia in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would have to carry out a 50% increase in gas extracted from neighbouring Turkmenistan compared to the price agreement concluded with Ukraine for 2008.
According to analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in prices for the shipment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important to argue in accordance with one of the most important gas transport transit states during the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinah to Reuters' news agency.
"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to our debate on the scale of transit costs through Ukraine (and to Western Europe)."
As a result of the recent major gas price dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed off the gas faucet to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a domino-like decrease in exports to Western Europe, which also greatly increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's gas supply.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still unexplored.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply with natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The NHS "must check foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS committees need to improve the control of criminal records of workers from outside Europe, said a supervisory body.
The proposal was put forward by Robert Black, the chief reporter, after a foreign-national doctor in Scotland was associated with an attack on the airport in Glasgow in June.
Mr Black also expressed concern that NHS Scotland did not have accurate data on the number of employees overseas.
At the same time, it pointed out in its report, through a sample of five health authorities, key controls that were properly carried out.
Following the attack on Glasgow airport, the main auditor verified the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
The 28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep hit the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of three doctors interrogated by the Old Bailey Court in October on charges of car bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees should verify the existence of the qualifications and work experience of the workers concerned and the availability of permits to work in the United Kingdom for their employees from overseas countries prior to the start of employment.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use the Disclosure Scotland to verify the criminal record, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside Great Britain.
Among other things, the rapporteur's report suggested that the committees introduce a guide to the Bureau of Criminal Records, which makes it easier for the employer to monitor with the various overseas countries.
"Although evidence of such checks has been found in the staff records, they are not regularly carried out," the report states.
According to Black, while the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment screening process at a high level, he added: "Our report highlights the developmentable areas of the system in order to provide up-to-date information on the number of NHS personnel from overseas".
According to Dr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, it is "extremely unrealistic" to use pre-employment checks to identify potential NHS employees who may commit terrorist acts in the future.
"According to the report, the pre-employment checks currently applied are working well in NHS Scotland, and the value of the proposals is not yet transparent," he added.
According to the Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas staff comprised of doctors and nurses is 1161.
However, the rapporteur pointed out that the figures were likely to be higher, partly due to the problems for committees to identify employees on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran regions, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are highly coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and qualification papers.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the Directive and guidance on inspections prior to the employment of NHS employees from overseas countries.
The health secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was very pleased that this task was accomplished after the attack on the Glasgow airport.
He also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment inspections for the entire staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version will be published next month.
Joy Division tarol at the film awards
The biopic "Control" about the late singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards - including the award for the best film.
The main character, Sam Riley, was also awarded a prize, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis' performance, as well as director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebell.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with the thriller "Details of a Scandal."
And the Variety Award, for the international spotlight of the British film, was taken by Daniel Craig, who played Bond.
The awards were awarded in the framework of a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control" presents Curtis' rise within Joy Division until 1980, when he committed suicide at age 23.
The Black and White film featuring "The Killers", David Bowie, and "New Order on the soundtrack" cost only £3 million.
The Dutch photographer Corbijn, who had previously become known by making the album cover of the U2 "Joshua Tree", has yet been enriched with two awards; the award of the best director and the best beginner director.
Another award winner of the ceremony focused on rock music; Julien Temple's film about Joe Strummer, the singer of Clash, took the award for the best documentary.
The award for the best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for the performance of David Cronenberg, the London thriller, the mob boss of "Murderous Promises".
Ray Winstone, famous for his role as a tough guy, was awarded the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name includes "Scum", "Hunger" and "Sexy Dog" films, is currently filming "The Kingdom of Indiana Jones and Crystal Skull".
Winstone is proud to receive the award named after Harris, the star of "Camelo" and "Harry Potter", who died in 2002.
"For people like me, people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door," Winstone added.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
Richard Harris' style is close to me, he was a great actor of his time, and I appreciate him very much."
The selection of independent film awards known as Bifa is decided by a group of film directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa's supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia, 208 people were arrested in connection with a terrorist conspiracy.
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants, involved in terrorist cells, were being arrested, planning to carry out an imminent attack on an oil facility and several attacks on church people and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one cell tried to smuggle missiles through.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
According to the television report, an eight-man cell led by a resident of a foreign nationality is planning to launch an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province.
After the attempt to attack the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006, organised by Al-Qaeda, Saudi Arabia began to build a rapid response force of 35,000 to protect the facilities.
According to the report of the Minister of the Interior, 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "person specializing in rocket shootings" illegally crossing the national border.
The report also reported that the fighters were trying to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom.
Of the 22 detainees, there were plans to assassinate church leaders and security forces.
The government has called for tougher action by the church leaders to stop Saudis who are joining Al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, who are fighting the Allied forces and the US-backed Shiite Muslim government.
Al-Qaeda fighters view a significant number of Saudi Arabian church leaders as being involved by the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The organization's fighters, encouraged by the call of the Saudi leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, to target the West-friendly Saudi government, aimed at the attacks of settlements, government buildings and energy facilities with a foreign population.
"Security forces have made a tremendous effort in the last... five months," said a Ministry of Interior spokesperson to state television.
During the arrests in Medina, a 16-person "media cell" was also captured with the aim of spreading "takfiri thinking". Takfiri thinking is an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which supports violence against Muslims branded unfaithful and apostate.
The arrests also included 32 people accused of financial support for militants.
Venus’ climate can provide an outlook for the future of the Earth
According to yesterday’s scholars, Venus was once able to provide pleasant living conditions.
Data from a European orbiting spacecraft suggest that this planet is more of a whimsical twin of the Earth than we thought it would be.
Venus is the closest planet neighbor on Earth.
The size of the two planets is almost the same and their orbit is similar, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, many billions of years ago, Venus had very similar living conditions and even habitable conditions.
However, because of the extremely high carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the lower rotational speed of the planet, Venus has entered a completely different developmental path.
Today, the water has evaporated from the planet, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, as well as being destroyed by hurricane - powerful winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year's study of the planet, paint a sobering picture of how similar catastrophic climate changes can develop on Earth.
Fred Taylor, professor at the Department of Physics at Oxford University, who is also one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Let's begin to figure out why Venus' climate is so far different from Earth's experience, despite the fact that both planets are very similar.
"With our new data, it was possible to develop a scenario of Venus's development billions of years ago, when it could still have a habitable environment like Earth.
"enriched uranium" seized by the police.
One kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesman, three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The spokesperson did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but stated that the material could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Wide Open Doors
Mitt Romney says he's not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
Yet the Republican candidates for the presidential election agreed to participate in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters videotaped their questions and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions submitted on Wednesday night 28 November proved as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate of the other party on YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time reflected the situation of the Republican party approaching for next year's elections.
It is not yet known how the CNN executives who co-financed the debate selected the YouTube videos submitted to the candidates.
The longest issue of the first half hour of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans.
CNN asked some uncertain voters to dial a number if they were to be intrigued: the mediator experienced outstanding consensus when candidates spoke harshly about the question of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between the leading national Rudy Giuliani and Romney at the crucial pre-elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the image of him, that during his mayorship in New York, he handled the issue of illegal immigration too lightly.
He accused Romney of hiring the ex-Massachusetts governor to build his house with illegal immigrants.
The argument between the two of them became particularly intense when the questioners asked about the support of "amnesty" (which would ensure permanent status and citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some candidates with fewer votes, such as Duncan Hunter from California and Tom Tancredo from Colorado, have been able to get into the matter thoroughly.
And while none of them are likely to stand a chance on the nomination, their stay on the racetrack may be explained by the fact that they started ringing the bell ringing the immigration bell earlier and louder than the others.
At least there is a broad consensus among the candidates on the issue of immigration: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to fight hard against illegal immigrants.
This theme, like fear of Chinese toxic toys and other disturbing factors from the outside world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimize the division between the Libertarians and Christian Conservatives.
However, when other subjects came to the fore, the debate became very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control.
John McCain and Romney debated whether simulated drowning should be considered torture.
Another questioner wondered if the candidates would believe all the Bible’s words.
In this question, Giuliani stumbled and finally held on to the view that although he considered the Bible his favorite book, Jonah and the whale might not literally interpret the story.
Another question arose as to whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who took the first place in the election in Iowa, was responsible for his victory because of his persistent Christian conservatism, responded to expectations that the death penalty was painful, but it was necessary.
When questioned whether Jesus would receive sufficient support, he laughed and said that Jesus was wiser than to run for office in the elections.
The competition remains unusually open.
Huckabee's dynamic in Iowa coincides with the libertarian Ron Paul's fund-raiser and the enthusiastic cheers surrounding him at the debate on Wednesday.
The sudden emergence of the two candidates can be explained by the fact that the two wings of the party have not yet succeeded in launching a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional aspirants.
In 1980 and 2000 there was a candidate who united the party, who sounded the victory message of America's greatness on time and convincingly and who found a common voice with both sides of the party.
Now, however, the party is divided, and the consequences of this are unimaginable for the time being.
Labour pains
There's another gap between Gordon Brown and the way out.
Compared to the British political scandals, this one doesn't seem too juicy.
No one sold their honor, no politicians found their Paris hotel bills, no one committed an extramarital scandal.
However, the discovery that for more than four years, a wealthy businessman has secretly contributed to the Labour Party, which ruled Britain, with an amount of more than £650,000 ($1.3 million), for more than four years under the name of others, is one of the things that would have been good without the ensnared Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister got out of the election, and when his statement - that opinion polls did not influence the outcome of the decision - thoughtlessly questioned the British's intellectual ability, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the deputy leader of the liberal democrats with increasingly witty remarks, noted, he turned from once feared Brown Stalin to Mr. Bean.
A mistake to save a needy bank called Northern Rock put regulatory weaknesses and weaknesses in judgment in the crossfire.
The sick proposals to change the tax law encouraged business interest groups to join forces with the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an unimaginable amount of administrative clumsiness.
In the House of Lords, three retired generals instigated a mutiny protesting against the reduction of the military budget, stating that the Minister of Defence's position was a part-time occupation.
And now we have David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary General of Labour (former administrative director) has resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown cannot turn back on the way out.
At the same time, governments can reach the point after which governance will be impossible.
People don't like politicians or trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, as it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is highly unlikely to be able to move things forward and may not even remain in office for a long time, the suspended infidelity is over: the civil servant's staff begins to leak, the cabinet ministers start briefings, the press is looking for bad news; the government starts to defend itself and will be unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is in a particularly difficult situation because, unlike other political leaders, he is not considered "fresh blood".
As much as you want to deny your relationship with Tony Blair, it was your right-hand man.
The problems surrounding Northern Rock and the IRS records, for example, relate to decisions made during Brown's Finance Ministership.
And although the long-term investigation of Blair's missteps, such as the "nobility for money" case and political party funding, was not directly involved, voters can rightly assume otherwise.
Although Brown's situation is really unpleasant, it's not as embarrassing as it looks.
Mistakes made aren't as scary as the throats say they are.
As in Mr. Bean's case, no one died, no one was directly duped.
And compensation - no matter how much pain it brings - can be the creation of the trends that Stalin, who resides in Brown, has always promised: reliable, solid and somewhat hard-handed governance.
For example, the fuss over political donation serves.
The conjecture Abrahams, who likened his donation to charity, said that he did not want to present his good deed to the public.
Perhaps so, but it was not his responsibility to make a decision.
The law prohibiting the anonymity of large political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks on the gate of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own words, knew Abrahams' actions, but was unaware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweated during interrogations; as will Jon Medleson, Head of the Labour Party Foundation, who was informed in October of the troubled donations.
To Brown, however, for the time being, there are no leads: there is no indication that he knew about these coils, not even that the huge sums were paid after Brown's entry into office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has fulfilled half his duties.
Although he soon condemned the violation of the law committed by his party, he diluted his strength by using familiar means; for the sake of security, he commissioned a committee led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "a lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of a violation, the police are in charge.
In addition, Brown needs to clean up other things, such as the appointment of the chairperson of an independent committee on administrative rules without a leader for six months or the effective reform of political party funding.
This would require the hard hat Workers' Party to cooperate with Torik and to break up with special financial relations linked to the associations - this would be a tough one for the party-like Brown.
But you should face some facts about the party.
According to surveys, conservatives are currently leading with a serious advantage; Brown has two years to get the voters back behind him; the only way to achieve victory is with impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Card Sharks
Is the second market mortgage crisis threatening America's credit card market?
If there's blood in the water, it's natural for sharks to appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. housing market is failing, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that if the mortgage credit crisis infects other forms of retail credit, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
There was an increase in both the rate of write-offs for irrecoverable loans and the rate of default for late payments over 30 days.
HSBC reported a loss of $1.4 billion in the US consumption finance segment last month, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is premature.
The proportion of write-downs and late payments remains low.
The 3.89% late payment rate calculated by the Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is one full percentage point lower than the historical average.
The decrease in rates can partly be explained by technical factors.
The amendment of the US rules on individual incapacity in 2005 resulted in a sudden decrease in the number of insolvency whistleblowers, but at the same time caused a large loss in the credit card market; the number of claims for bankruptcy (and thus the write-down rate) can be expected to increase again, whether the total terms of borrowing are deteriorating or not.
The payment rate, which shows the monthly rate of consumer credit repayment, is also solid on the market.
In addition, trust in credit card-backed securities is also quite strong, despite the paralysis in other areas of structured finance.
Dennis Moreney at TowerGroup estimates that the 2007 emissions volume will be 25% higher than last year.
There are clear signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit card market: consumers are increasing the debt on credit cards to repay housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers primarily monitor the movement of money and not the asset value, and therefore the fall in house prices does not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Creditors may also benefit from the situation.
If the property is worth less than the value of the mortgage loan, consumers will be less encouraged to repay credit; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards will move forward in the priority ranking.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexiblely to changing conditions than mortgage lenders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of a sudden re-price of assets.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up with a complete reassessment of loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital One's CFO.
If a sudden subprime crisis in the credit card market is less likely, the risk of a gradual decline is more likely.
If declining housing prices and a fall in lending bring America to a recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a grim future.
It's worth watching those predator fins.
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
On Wednesday, he confessed his guilt to the three British bankers who were tried to investigate their role in fraud involving Enron's former financial director, Andrew Faston.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially declared themselves innocent on the charge of seven counts of fraud, according to which they supposedly cooperated with Fastow in a covert fraud committed in 2000 to make money at the expense of their employer.
Their trial started in January.
However, at a court hearing, before the U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of one-on-one fraud.
Three former employees of the Greenwich NatWest section of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group became known in Britain during the two-year extradition process.
The investigation of the case initiated following the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
The first indictment against them in 2002 warned Fastow that he was one of the targets of the government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
The three brokers named "NatWest Three" were accused of going to Houston in 2000 to prepare the fraud together with Fastow and Fastow's right hand Michael Kopper.
Fastow, responsible for designing the numerous frauds that bankrupten Enron, also controlled the Enron subsidiary into which Greenwich NatWest invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of its shareholding in the subsidiary, but the three British men well knew that the interest was quite large.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank’s stake in the subsidiary of $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a stake in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company was buying a subsidiary share worth $20 million from Greenwich NatWest.
But in fact, $20 million was the grip of British bankers Fastow and others.
The prosecution says that bankers got 7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and others got $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two counts of guilt because of his role in Enron's collapse.
The British three was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three English men were allowed to travel to the United States on bail of $1 million each, where they reside during the trial.
Enron, the ever seventh largest American company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks have ceased to cover the millions accumulated as debt and the profitable but actually loss-making enterprises.
Thousands of jobs have been lost due to the collapse, the market value has decreased by over 60 billion dollars and the value of pension funds by over 2 billion dollars.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted last year for their complicity in the bankruptcy of the company.
Skilling is currently in prison for over 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay ended with the man's death last year.
No Poverty in Moscow
At 54 million dollars, a Gulfstream G550 with a Rolls-Royce engine will begin, which will take the journey between Moscow and Los Angeles without interruption with a tank.
However, for some Russian rich, this amount is considered a small change.
"18 passengers fit," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one assigns so many seats because machines are purchased for private families or corporate managers."
Mr. Firer was expecting visitors at the four-day exclusive Millionaire Fair, which was held in a huge exhibition hall in the vicinity of the capital city.
Besides Gulfstream, there are more than 200 other luxury goods at the exhibition that are rented booths, hoping that the Russian new rich will be interested in everything, from yachts covered in mahogany to diamond-covered 50 cents worth of grills.
Mr. Firer carefully watched the bright orange Porsche on the stand next door.
"It's a nice car, but it's no match for our products," he said.
"Private aircraft have the largest market in Russia after the United States."
The Russian capital seems to be swimming in money like Dallas did in his prime at the time of the oil price explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s when some American millionaires went to Europe. These Americans were regarded here as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, senior scholar of the Davis Centre of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabians of the 1970s and Japanese gamblers of the 1990s, the Russians have now become the most spectacular spenders in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their share of the gold rush.
At another conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, the President of the LVMH, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, shared their views on how to sell high-value products on markets similar to Russia.
(The conference was organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to Forbes's list of richest people, there are 53 billion dollars in Russia who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103,000, who can own a total of $670 billion, was found by a study carried out by economists at the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analyses personal welfare developments in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
(According to data from the World Bank, the number of people living below the minimum level of living in Russia was 15.8% in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires living in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London David Morris jewelry store.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly well-groomed, and men are a real treasure mine."
On Sunday night, two real estate agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, were both attributed to themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I looked at cars and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was brazenly rushed and spun in her custom-designed dress, as if she had already gotten used to this fuss.
The fair was primarily held for the new rich, for brand-oriented Russian customers who are willing to go around after several hours of traffic in a draughty, cypher-decorated venue, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pocket knives, Mövenpick ice cream, usual billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund plush bears at the same time.
For ordinary people, admission costs EUR 30 ($44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr Gijrath, who had a patriotic seat at the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft, in contrast to a wall-sized, hand-decorated, blue tile-painted Rembrandt.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in striking things."
Indeed, the sellers here have said that long-standing Russians (based on Russian standards, this means 10-15 years) have already moved from flash logos to brands made in limited editions that would not get into a trade fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, millionaires, and tourists, filled the place every day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil bed company, said that he sold two mattresses worth $70,000 made of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of A1 Moto, who supplied high-quality cars with modern alarms, reported that his company sold the shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170,000.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car manufacturer who delivers solutions to individual needs, sold three grilles to Rolls-Royce Phantoms by Sunday afternoon.
He also showed reporters a wheel made for the owner of a Russian casino, which he said Swarovski brought in with crystals to create the appearance of a roulette wheel.
The price of a four-piece set is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich skin and a picture of his wife's face made of a zirconium cube will not necessarily use these objects," said Karapetian.
"He'll keep them in the garage of 30-40 car keepers."
Despite the fact that many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian believes that the term "Russian millionaire" is not a great privilege today, given the rapid increase in property prices there.
"He who bought property in Moscow four or five years ago is probably a millionaire today, if not in money, or at least on paper," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least make the appearance of wealth appear outside the stand of the Alliance Continental Trust Company.
The company built four British-style phone booths that were stacked up with millions of counterfeit dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that his team had printed 500 thousand counterfeit notes for the millionaires' fair.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with the money, and many of them took pictures of themselves on their cell phones as they were lying in a pile of money or just pocketing a few million dollars.
"You see, everyone in Moscow must feel like a millionaire," Karryev said.
They suspect a surgical malpractice behind a death in New Jersey.
It was the day before Thanksgiving that Ronald Livingston looked out the flat glass window of a restaurant called "Just A Little healthier" and saw an ambulance stop two doors down West Scott Avenue on Cape Cod.
Soon after, a police patrol car arrived.
Then another one.
"Then I saw the doctor's car stop," said Mr Livingston, an inspector working at the restaurant on Wednesday.
"Then I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman is 41 years old, her name is Olga Arroyo.
We're currently investigating whether death was caused by an unlicensed surgery performed by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet been able to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the results of the tox screen tests, which will be available in a few weeks, will shed light on this mysterious death, which has caused great pain to high-ranking Newark police personnel.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"He was loyal, diligent and reliable," said McCarthy Arroyo in a Wednesday interview on the phone.
". He was my watchdog.
He was my protector."
McCarthy said that Mrs Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer, currently working on the Committee on the Control of Spicy Products, and left behind two boys, 14 and 11 years old, and a stepdaughter.
A spokesman for Theodore J. Romankow, U.S. Attorney Eileen Walsh of Union County, said that the investigators were working to find out if Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unauthorised surgeon's intervention.
"He's got a high probability," Walsh said.
"The investigation is ongoing."
Authorities report that they arrived at the house around 3:00 p.m. in November
The 21st and Mrs Arroyo were found on the couch.
He was already declared dead at the scene.
It's been over a week, and the police have told us very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't talk about Castro being listened to by the detectives.
The participants of the study are looking into whether some of the house was a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a dead rose bush stood in the narrow front yard and a Dalmatian barked from the back of the house.
Next to the door to the cellar, the driveway had a blue container marked "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on the side.
McCarthy recalled that when she first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was an invaluable help in helping her navigate the unusual and unbridled political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "You better be careful with this and that," he remembered.
"He was always here when I arrived this morning, and he was always there when I left this evening.
It was embarrassing."
Expectations to cut Fed's interest rate lead to a storm of world stock markets
On both sides of the Atlantic, stock prices spiked yesterday, after the reassuring statements of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of America increased his hopes that the Fed would try to ease investment opportunities by further cutting interest rates.
The stock markets in both London and New York and across Europe have developed since Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of the Fed President Ben Bernanke, stated that the leaders must respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing unrest on the financial markets.
In addition to Kohn's clear objective of calming down markets in the wake of the signs of a revitalising credit crisis, he stated that the present unrest "has partially rejected the progress made on the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if increased confusion persists, it could increase the possibility of further restrictions on credit conditions for households and companies.
The statements were interpreted by investors as being ready to inject fresh capital into the US markets or even further interest reductions to stabilise credit conditions.
The statements have also calmed Wall Street, which has recently been hit by a number of bad news concerning the American economy, such as the negative record of American housing sales.
The side effect of the financial unrest was also confirmed by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that, in order to offset the loss in the US second-market housing loan sector, 650 workers and 4 percent of their global workforce are being made redundant as part of the cost reduction.
The above measure concerns 20 jobs at the London headquarters with 1500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent and closed at 13.289.40 points, while the wider S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, 2.7 percent and closed at 6.306.2 and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 grew 2.3 percent.
The credit market turmoil was renewed after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank brought the three-month paper to the European banks at a 4,7 percent price, which has not been seen since April 2001.
After an even increase after November 12, Libor reached its highest level since September, 6.59 percent, the Bank of England was under more pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB, as well as to release additional capital to the London financial market.
In England, they demand a decision between Owis Shah and Ravi Bopara.
There are two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Whose field six of the English team in Kandy, Owis Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in an indirect context of the first test against Sri Lanka, it's no less important who makes the decision?
On the one hand, the latter question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selectors, who temporarily fulfills this particular task, assists the head coach Peter Moores and the captain Michael Vaughan in the decision, and on the other hand, because the branch of the English Executive Director Hugh Morris' desk is filling with requests for a national or at least one-time selection post.
Of the two players, the short draw is the one that doesn't get the sixth place, but as we know, life and especially sports are often unfair.
It is never easy to say what makes a person reach the top of his profession, while others can't even get past a lower level, often it depends on luck rather than talent.
It is not just cricket that it is difficult to select on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it fair to Shah if that happens?
The same question may be raised in other areas of life, for example, if John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart young leaders with excellent qualifications and knowledge of business, were presented to decision-makers, while only one of them has room.
Who can tell me which level a cricket player is supposed to be without being thrown into deep water in a major race?
Of course, the data greatly influences the decision, but the options are equally important.
In a team, the player has to catch the captain's glance at the cricket gate at the right moment, and a batter has to get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player.
Catching the look of the selectors is much more complicated.
For example, more people played better than James Anderson last season, but he's definitely a team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison himself said he's in good shape and he's doing very well.
Anderson fought off his tour with 32 first-class gates and 33 runs.
Chris Tremlett only struck 29, but both of them have had successful moments at the highest level and hope that they will continue to do so in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well, that will be decided by opinion.
This decision can blow up or break anyone's career, but it may not have a special effect on the future.
Four years ago, Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played every test and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, yet it was the Paul Collingwood who was then emerging and became a determining test cricketer, who may still be underestimated even today, despite winning a double hundred against Australians in Australia.
In their discussion at Asgiriya Stanion today, listening to their conservative instincts, Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will probably vote for Shah's greater experience against Bopara's young vigor and dynamism.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is in favour of his bright and successful debut in the districts of the test in Bombay in '88, against the six of the 22-year-old Bopara, seven years younger than him, who also achieved 32 first-class hundreds in excellent twists.
However, the fact that the Middlesex player in Shah's test at Lorda in May ran only ten rounds against the West Indies in two quarters, and the fact that Vaughan, who fought for him again in the next game, met the immediate resistance of the selectors, seems to have reduced his endurance, which in Bombay was still clear on him.
As opposed to him, Essex's universal talent is a lifeless and unsurpassed player.
You can't upset him with anything on the cricket court, but his off-track behavior was well described when he flipped over at an exhibition with a four-wheeler of the team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
However, the first thing he did afterwards was to take Vodafone's phone into his hands (of course sponsored) and call his remotely monitoring teammate, Alastair Cook, to ask him: "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a better field player with classics. He creates a good pitching angle with his slippery mid-steps, and his punches are confident and skillful.
Choosing the right person is one thing, and another is the right moment.
Maybe it's the real art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would make a difference if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he'd be the one playing this weekend.
They're taking the refugees home by bus to work and fight Al-Qaeda.
Since yesterday, the first buses from Syria have arrived in Baghdad with Iraqi refugees who have run out of money or have expired their visas, or even those who hope the city has regained order.
There are also those who have returned to fight the soldiers who chased them out of their house.
The bus station in Mansour was full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled dozens of buses arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Dr. Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni.
"Today I came back because I saw what happened in Baghdad and that the city was safe now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to pastor Moqtada al-Sadr militiaman, who has currently stopped his Shiite army.
The 38-year-old Shiite teacher Qassim al Atwani from Amariyah, a predominantly Sunni, returned home with his two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented Iraqis from taking a job.
Amariya’s skitted neighbours called and urged him to return home, saying that with the help of American support troops, Al Qaeda was pushed out of their bastion in the western part of the capital.
One of the first to arrive from Jordan was a Sunni and Shiite tribal leader who fled a grenade attack from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, after encouraging his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called and told me that they had created an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed my support and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
A lot of people have talked about the fact that since the entry of American troops in the capital, peace has been strengthened and they have been lured home by armed civilian forces working with Americans.
But more people were forced to return from Damascus because of visa-related and financial problems.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, with three children, expressed a widespread view among refugees that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki Shiite asked the Syrian government to reject the visa application of refugees to force their return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped the death squads in the country.
"Everything was fine until Al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop issuing visas to Iraqis to move back home," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I fled."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the Sunnits were driven away from the Shita areas, while the Shies left the Sunnitian settlements, which led to a reduction in tension in many regions.
Many fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will resurrect the moods that may lead to further battles.
Small Saarland - prestigious training
The smallest Länder plays a leading role in professional training, and its higher education is also internationally oriented.
Only in one training area are Saarlanders struggling with the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"For the 50th time yesterday I explained to a non-Saar country that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan is advertised on his posters for the 50th birthday of the smallest federal province.
However, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saarland, which can boast the fifth place on the basis of a survey by the German Institute for Economics (IW) in Cologne.
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries, even because of traditions.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
Accordingly, the rate of foreign students is 15.6 percent high.
However, the students and universities of the Saar region are also attracted to those who want to study in the Saar region, many of whom have no secondary education.
"In the Saar region, the opportunities for professional training are being exploited," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Institute of Economics.
More than a fifth of the young people gain further education in vocational schools, making the Saar region more than seven percent higher than the federal average.
The combination of vocational and higher education is also well developed.
The infrastructure for double studies is second in terms of population numbers in Germany.
Despite practice-oriented training and increasing interest, however, the number of graduate engineers has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education obliged the higher education institutions to provide marketing services focusing on engineering.
"A number of reforms were initiated in primary schools after the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has carried out comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of kindergarten is free of charge. This is a model that other federal provinces have been copying.
Only future comparative studies will answer the question as to whether the performance of the students will continue to improve.
Based on the Pisa survey conducted in 2003, the proportion of students at risk shrunk from 29 to 20 percent.
However, the overall performance of the Saarland did not improve to the same extent as that of the other Lands.
Bavarians do better numbers.
To the greatest annoyance of the Saarlanders, the Pisa test does not take into account foreign language knowledge - otherwise otherwise, in this area they could reap laurels,
Because the language of the neighbouring countries in high schools is a mandatory subject - even if the Saarlanders are not French.
Chávez is changing the clocks
In Venezuela, in the near future, classes are going to be different from in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Chávez is turning back half an hour in the Latin American country.
Meanwhile, Chávez became a laughing stock in Spain.
As Venezuela's official newspaper said, under a new law, clocks are being turned back four and a half hours compared to the time in Greenwich.
In this way, the South American state will be part of a time zone that is not used in any other country in the world.
The anti-United States Chávez justified its decision, among other things, by forcing the entire hourly time zones into the world by the United States.
Chávez also announced on Wednesday (local time) the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist politician stated that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the President of Colombia, he will not be in contact with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to give their opinion on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, it would significantly build its power in the country.
The reason for the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw his mandate from Chávez to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels on the release of hostages.
Uribe's decision to "spit in the face" Venezuela, he voiced his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, there was a new mobile ringing sound: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you shut your mouth), that is the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded for themselves from the Internet.
The sentence comes from Charles János, King of Spain, who at the last Latin America summit was so upset by the constant shouting of the Balolda populist politician that he entered into his word.
In 2007 the German people are facing a reduction in wages
A real wage reduction is forecast to threaten German workers this year, despite strong economic activity.
Experts have supported their pessimistic predictions for many reasons.
According to the Hans-Bröckler Foundation calculations, employees can actually expect less salaries in 2007 than in the previous year.
"This modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the rapid rise in food and energy prices are the cause of this," said Gustav Horn, a member of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Conjuncture Research.
There may also be new burdens on workers in terms of unemployment insurance.
Mr Peer Steinbrück, Minister of Finance, stated in his statement to the daily newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung", that in the current situation it is appropriate to reduce unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the beginning of the new year.
In any event, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be in such a difficult position to apply to the Alliance for credit or support, quoting the politician of the German Social Democratic Party, the SPD.
On Tuesday, it became known that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation rate for 13 years.
In an annual comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 percent.
Venus is Earth's diabolical twin
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more similar to the Earth than has been assumed: In its atmosphere, the European "Venus Express" spacecraft has discovered lightnings, and in its polar circles windstorms such as those that occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is a lightning bolt.
The European "Venus Express" space probe provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: Lightning on Venus spreads from cloud to cloud at a height of 56 kilometers, reporting on the columns of the science magazine "Nature" by Christpher Russell of California University, Los Angeles.
According to the famous "old soup theory", the formation of life on Earth was caused by lightning: According to the theory, thunderstorms started reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of the building blocks of amino acids, life.
Not on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it could have been in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
At present, there can hardly be a living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around 100 times denser than on Earth, and temperatures sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"Venus may be a hell of a twin on Earth, but it's still his twin brother," Russell said.
The main question of the Esa mission is why Venus, in its mass and size, is so similar to the Earth, is on a completely different developmental path.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in Venus research, because since the early 1990s no probe has been on its way to find this planet.
The latest research results already presented in several "Nature" articles do not, in the opinion of researchers, only demonstrate the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"They also point to the fact that the similarity of the neighboring planet to the Earth is greater than we first assumed," said Esa.
In addition to the already known Arctic whirlwind, researchers also discovered an even faster moving cloud vortex in the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds me of the air currents of the winter hemisphere on Earth, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Institute.
The second innermost planet of the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth, and with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers, it is almost as large as the Earth.
The Celestial Body, also called the Evening Star, travels around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own wheel — one Venus Day lasts 243 days on earth.
Although the surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius, coupled with the pressure of Venus 92 bar, is hardly reminiscent of Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both of them had pooled water, which remained on Earth as an ocean, while on Venus they left for the universe.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth was bound in carbonate rocks, on Venus, this is a large part of the atmosphere.
Mr. Köhler will defend Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the German Republic, Köhler, demands the end of the inter-party debate that has erupted around the reception of the Dalai Lama in the chancellery office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the reception in September.
President Horst Köhler of the German Republic is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the Grand Coalition to end the debate surrounding the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not be seen as a divided nation in this matter to the outside world," said Köhler to Handelsblatt.
Köhler simultaneously expressed his understanding that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) received the Dalai Lama in September.
"For me, human rights are universally valid even if I respect the diversity of cultures", said Köhler.
Everyone is aware that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, the President of the Republic stressed; however, Merkel has defended himself against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not break up with the traditional "one China" policy.
China is aware of this," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly expressed his disapproval of the reception of the Dalai Lama and has therefore become the target of attacks in the EU.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's "exploitation policy" in the foreign policy field.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the chancellor's office, there were severe disturbances in the relationship between Germany and China.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rejected the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL's information.
Chinese head of state Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China rejects the Chinese position of Wen Jiabao when European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in their official capacity.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama pointed out that they were trying to separate further Tibetan territories including Tibet and other provinces today.
Schäuble protects against disturbances such as those in France
Street clashes with the police, shootings, flaming cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against riots like those in France.
All efforts must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not end in street violence, demanded by the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricads were on fire, bandits were shooting shotguns at the police: After the serious disturbances of young people in France, Federal Minister for the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears similar developments.
"We must ensure that the social explosives do not accumulate or end in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neu Presse" newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people adapt to the rapid changes in social reality.
Association, provinces and communities are currently working intensively on solving problematic cases, said Schäuble.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic conference, the first successes are already evident."
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble also referred to the absence of urban and sociological problems in German suburbs, such as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, youths fought with police in heavy street fights.
Toulouse also had cars and public buildings on fire.
In view of this, Kenan Kolat, Head of the Turkish Communities of Germany, demanded a greater degree of activity in terms of integration.
In connection with the riots in France, Kolat warned about "the dangers of imitation".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
But it is necessary to act.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families is "higher than average".
Above all, more education places should be taken care of.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a perspective."
However, the head of the Turkish Community added that "social supervision within the family" is much more present in Germany than in France.
Moreover, many young people from immigrant families do not want to ruin what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "Nevertheless, we must be on guard."
Young people "should be given the opportunity to have a job and receive education as quickly as possible".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel, during the night, there was a complete calm.
Hundreds of police officers were standing by, a helicopter with headlights scanning the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as some flaming garbage cans and cars.
Since reporting, a safety unit of around 1000 people has provided peace of mind.
The police are ready to intervene as long as it is necessary, announced after the visit of Home Secretary Michelle Alliot-Marie to the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday, 80 police officers were injured as a result of the riots in Villiers-Le-bel.
The next night, the riots spread to Toulouse.
The riots broke out in a traffic accident, during which two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the state's attorney's office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
Cloudwalker in Angela's realm
The chancellor's untruthful action is proof that the coalition is at its end - and nothing can be expected of him.
What country does the Federal Chancellor actually live in?
Following a bleak, indifferent and inconsequential action by the Bundestag in its general debate, it must be stated that he does not live here - not in the country whose governance would be his responsibility.
She rejected the charge with a very superior sentence, Angela Merkel, saying that she would focus too much on foreign policy.
It is provincial, he replied, and in this way he only expressed that he did not want to understand what critics were talking about.
At the Federal Assembly, he made it clear to everyone how appropriate reproaches are.
In the meantime, there was no specific interest or empathy towards the country's problems.
Instead, Cloudwalker Angela appeared: a politician who ran away from reality, who fled to foreign policy, and there was only uncertainty.
Example of climate protection: Heiligendamm makes unbridled praises for its decisions, but he keeps quiet about how to achieve climate objectives in the country.
At all, as far as self-praise is concerned, such modesty would not have been allowed by the President of the CDU two years ago.
Now he's clinging to the phrase that prosperity has a positive effect on people.
It harms his reputation as a pragmatic personality who solves problems instead of the wordflowers.
However, in the realm of cloud-walking Angela, domestic policy problems are only incidental.
Child poverty and low income problems?
He only values this to a few half sentences.
In this regard, how often he slips tongues when it comes to family allowances.
It takes Merkel three times to make a half-baked sentence.
When it comes to specifics, it's in an alien area.
Surgeon Division.
During the debate between the Republican presidential candidates at YouTube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, had a hard blow - and now they have to be afraid of an outside candidate.
The candidates' tensions have already surfaced on the first subject.
Mitt Romney blames his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, for making New York City a "illegal asylum for immigrants."
He, on his part, concurs with serious facts: "I would say that his own house served as a refuge for illegal immigrants", returns Giuliani, and vomits on the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts that he employed undocumented immigrants as private persons.
Candidates are on the move: Since the Republican camp still does not have a unitedly supported favorite, the eight presidential candidates will use the debate on CNN first and foremost to undermine the credibility of their opponent.
Private 30-second videos sent by Internet users through Youtube are hardly more than short summaries.
"With this kind of isolacinicism, we put Hitler in power," rubs John McCain under the nose of his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one in the circle who demands immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam's veteran when he is reluctant to condemn as torture the so-called "Waterboarding", the interrogation method in which drowning is simulated.
The fact that important topics of the campaign are yet beyond Iraq and the debates on torture is shown by the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Loud applause erupts in the room in praise of conservative values and in rejection of future tax increases.
Meanwhile, the weaknesses of the two candidates are becoming more and more visible.
"I was wrong at that time," says Romney, repentantly, and apologizes to the supporters and television viewers for voting for abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is shaken when she is being asked for her opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf first governs as a civilian
One day after his withdrawal from the army, Musharraf was sworn in as President of Pakistan.
This will put an end to eight years of military domination in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan was married to Pervez Musharraf for a further term of office of five years on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcasts live from the capital, the presidential palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn on the constitution and on his actions for the good of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and thus gave in to international pressures from the United States.
Eight years after the break of the former general into power in the form of a military coup without bloodshed, he now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With Musharraf's withdrawal as Chief of Armed Forces, he met a fundamental demand from the West and the opposition.
Another important demand is the removal of the state of emergency announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum said that soon after Musharraf's oath, he would eliminate the state of emergency, thereby fulfilling a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, to which Musharraf placed lawyers sympathetic to him at the beginning of November following the declaration of the state of emergency, rejected all protests over the past week regarding the disputed re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in the attack on a military convoy in Northern Waziristan, North Waziristan.
According to information from the military spokesperson, the bomb went off on a road near the Afghanistan border.
The Fathers of the Krautrock Return
The German super team from the 1970s is playing again: The three band members of Harmonia dusted off their instrument again for a concert in Berlin.
During the reassembly, from their prime, the time of "Live 1974", a cut film appears.
They were well known abroad at that time.
The announced sensation takes the form of the three agreed gentlemen around the dinner table.
Each has its own instrument, its own cable and, above all, its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in the middle with 63 years of white shirt.
Michael Rother, who is 57 years young from the left, offers an escort with a laptop and guitar.
Looking from the right from the audience, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius is focused on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, even a rhythm once in a while.
All of this sometimes happens to be like traditional music.
This, however, does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
It was a great thrill for those who liked the krautrock music trends that the Harmonia band was playing again.
What we can tell you here: As a result of proper follow-up, we can conclude that the name has passed through the collective pop memory, but by no means has left such permanent clues that this band has been painfully missed after 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate the living legends of their 70s?
Especially since what we call misleadingly krautrock has always been appreciated more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for oeuvre to the still living members of the Can band in Cologne in 2003, the figures of the German pop sat in the room with an incomprehensible face.
When he thanked even the La Düsseldorf and Neu! bands in the Laudation of Red Hot Chili Peppers, the amazement became limitless.
At the concerts, Michael Rother sat on stage as an old friend with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Domestic rejection and foreign acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
Harmonia overloads memory only because the trio existed for only two years, and during that time it had far less effect than others later attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with an artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising Cluster name.
Initially, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
And then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, a church-funded record company.
Rother helped Kraftwerk for a short time, and in parallel, he won a reputation as the guitarist of the perhaps most radical German band, Neu!
Around 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster musicians into their exile at Weserbergland Forst.
There in Alter Weserhof, a 16th - century city in Ruin, he fled as a communist.
Less ideologically than in the First Commune, where Roedelius was still babysitting.
Their lives are more idyllic art.
It is said that out of the garbage, Harmonia Ottenstein's songboard has emerged and thus they have come up with a name for their art.
Some of these things have been recorded by Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and the next album is called "De Luxe".
Despite his loose and modest music, the band was in financial need.
The collection of money alone did not ensure self-determination.
The CD published under the title "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of an audience with a record number of barely 50 people, so someone remembers.
Forced Harmonia and occasional practice at the time was Rother's idea.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral demand.
The band announced its dissolution in 1975.
Rother ended up with esoterics and maintained himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluster was revived in the '80s, which has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The Griessem live album is thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company called Greenland set out to take care of the krautrock as the unique German adjective of live music.
As part of this, Neu! was dug up as well as Roedelius' solo creation.
The resurrection of Harmonia will take place in the Berlin House of Culture.
For public money, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope, the author of the British ancestor and the manual Krautrock Sampler, is also present.
Also present is Loveparade's thinker, Dr. Motte.
All of this outlines the effect of krautrock on the coming pop music era.
In this respect, Harmonia fills out the space reserved for the super team.
Brian Eno's statement floats along with the most unusual voices in the room: "The only true music, he owns the future."
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
The projection of other black and white photographs of tangled cable equipment serves the building of legends.
In the lobby, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
This merely means attaching microphones to the organ and drum equipment with the intention of attracting sound effects that have not yet been heard from the instruments by means of devices that produce their own instrumental sound effects.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three tech-enhancing DIYers.
Even the house choir doesn't change anything.
Under the command of Barbara Morgenstern, they cry and whisper and sing "Aaaaaaaaaah!" in a beautiful part.
After all, krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here shouts '68', they're not on the wrong path, and Harmonia still won't let them off their feet.
Even the most self-evident thing is carefully thought out on stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can make a person nervously grind, or offer you the fleeting moments of exceptional luck.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
Through "Running" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films once again deal with the Balkan War.
However, none of them are convincing.
The idea is either too much for action and shooting, or it's too emotional.
Even Richard Gere himself can't help that in "The Hunt."
First of all, although the two war criminals Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, they found the actor Richard Gere again in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian war.
Recently, we have lost sight of the most beautiful man in the eighties, as many of the good-boy-nothing roles played in emotional films for women and the many press conferences on Buddhism have taken our heart off even looking at them.
And here it is, all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most pressing argument for maybe watching the movie "Running."
It gives a wonderful, smiling performance: Basically, the war correspondent Simon Hunt, who he created, could have become what Gere would have been if fate and the film industry were not so gracious to him: A man who had long since left his most beautiful years behind, but his decline, as a ruinous monument, preserved a significant part of his former appeal.
However, the film "Running" and the German production "Mörderischer Frieden" started to be screened this week, despite this performance, continues only an endless series of failed films about the Balkan War.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers serving in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serbian woman from the Kosovo snipers, and one of them suddenly falls in love with her as an encore.
Although it is to be welcomed that, for once, Serbs are not the sole cause of all evil, the film, which carries the shallowness of TV films, is lost too quickly in the shooting and eventful scenes.
"Cobra 11" carries character - instead of highways, war.
On the other hand, it can be seen in the case of "Running" in an example of why no really good film has actually been made about the Balkan War.
The story of the three war correspondents in the United States, who are emerging to search for the Serbian chief war criminal named Fox, with another director and other screenwriters (both in Richard Shepard's persunalunion) could have become perhaps a new "Apocalypse now" at another age.
After all, the stories show a surprising similarity: In both cases, small groups begin to go to the forest to do what the army cannot do - and in both cases, the journey to madness will be the result.
One of the reasons why "Running" failed is that he simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be the depraved cynic listening to his heart, as he first portrays him.
No, and as an addition to the script, he spends a romantic affair with a later-murdered Muslim Bosnian woman.
"The Hunts" will slip away when reporters, in the last five minutes of the film, are fast-tracked to what Nato, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world couldn't do in five years: capture the war criminal and hand him over to the Muslim Bosnians for a just revenge.
It's so bad that you want to go to the Hague International Tribunal for the crime against the logic of cinema.
But the purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to expose Karajics and Mladics to the fact that they are still at large and suspect the Americans and the French (allegedly still exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing persecution intensively because of secret political deals.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that you think of a famous Brecht poem.
In this, the poet writes about the wooden mask depicting the Asian demon on his desk: "I look with a glass at his temple at the throbbing vein, which tells me how tiring it is to be bad".
Movies like "Running" have the same oversized human-head masks, which, however, show how exhausting it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all the Hollywood movies about Iraq were an ugly failure.
We can add: There has not yet been a good movie about South Africa.
It almost always applies: If a star wanders around in the world's crisis or minefields, it will result in something like "The Paths of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie, or the "Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts are simply too close to time.
I mean, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good movie about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List."
Probably some of the films are still worth it - since the classic works of the Vietnam War, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were not unanimously celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But it is possible that today, when all mass killings come into our home in real time, right through two screens, we simply know too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs screenwriters of ignoring reality, which they need to tell good stories.
After all, "To be or not to be" or "The dictator" are finally so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin have not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime really is.
Maybe you shouldn't try to do the right thing if you want to make a good movie.
Maybe we need to focus on the sarcastically distant artistic perspective of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was questioned about the parallels between his historical novel "The Lemprière-lexicon" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "It depends only on the fact that certain things never change.
Big cities will always be terribly dangerous, people will always be horribly murdered, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust is severely criticized for resigning the Olympics
The mayor's demarcation of Hamburg's tender for the summer Olympic Games triggered intense criticism in political and economic life.
A lot of people want to keep fighting for water games.
However, Von Beust strongly warns of reality during the odds.
Managing Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal "unfavourable to the economic environment" on Wednesday.
No other project has recently unleashed such powerful motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, we cannot keep the momentum of sport policy even."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "from modified time coordinates".
Mayor Ole von Beust insisted that Hamburg's ambition for the Olympic Games was not realistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides the Olympic competition, it's the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sports Association's decision in early December about the tender submitted for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Munich.
"To give this priority to us means that within the period which we have thought of up to 2028, we will not have realistic chances."
Nevertheless, we will not give up the dream forever, said von Beus.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) expressed regret over von Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg does not intend to apply for the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early to take a chance by burying our plans already," said Günter Ploß, president of HSB on Wednesday.
Moreover, the withdrawal from the tender is contrary to the Senate President's statement at the General German College Sports Association General Assembly.
There, the tender submitted to Von Beust Hamburg for the 2015 Univerziade described it as not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association only launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition last week.
The SPD's civilian faction has accused the Senate of leaving valuable time unused for building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it voted alongside the Olympics and neglected to build homes," said two SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to lance alongside an integrated plan for Olympic and later residential use for Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU unilaterally focused on the "event factor".
The tender for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at that time sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
The one who links the concepts of Sweden and the wooden box to each other is Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, wooden crates manufactured in Sweden cast a dark shadow on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box listed in this box is forgery.
After a few months ago, the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" challenged the originality of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo Boxes, the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now come to a sobering conclusion: The six copies of "Brillo Box" donated to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén, former museum director in 1995, and most likely a hundred more "Stockholm-type" Brillo Boxes on the international art market.
The prehistoric history is a confusing chain of long and complicated artistic and curatorial stunts.
Warhol created the first "Brillo Boxai" in New York in 1964 - painted wooden crates based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard box of the "Brillo" soap powder.
At an exhibition of his works held in Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard were exhibited: These (for cost-saving reasons) were not from Warhol, but were transported directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It wasn't about works of art, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
However, in 1968 Warhol authorized the production of some Brillo wooden crates in Sweden, which were not issued in Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the age are now talking about 15 crates that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box and entered art and auction history under the designation "Stockholm type".
Some of them were auctioned off for over $100,000.
The problem is, however, that later, later, the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén falsely claimed that in 1968 a hundred wooden crates were manufactured and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, the 105 crates of Hultén were only manufactured in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, however, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main monumentist at Moderna Museet, examined three Swedish private boxes in addition to the six Brillo Boxes owned by the museum, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The pressed chipboards were first based and sanded, and then brushed up with the white oil paint.
The structure of the copies from 1990, on the other hand, tells us that the paint was taken directly onto the chipboard with a painting cylinder without foundation - and it is not even an oil paint, but an acrylic paint.
"These crates were not authenticated by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes", says Lars Nitttve, Director of Moderna Museet: "Unless the New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Of course, the Authentication Board announced in June that it was investigating the "serious accusations" of soap dust crates.
Since then, however, they have been entrenched in unforgiving silence.
Manila rebel soldiers give up
They gave up the rebellion in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can't take responsibility for the bloodshed, he told reporters at the hotel their leader, Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud.
Prior to that, the hotel was stormed by government-faithed soldiers using tear gas.
Two dozen soldiers have barricaded themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was in court on Thursday because of the failed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly release a wheel with 30 sympathisers.
The military police in charge of guarding the man obviously turned to him and joined the mutiny.
They invaded the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the overthrow of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government units have sealed off the vicinity of the high-end hotel.
The president has called the security cabinet for an emergency meeting.
Security consultant Norberto Gonzales has condemned the military's procedure.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was former commander of the Scout Rangers Corps, stated that other units of the army wanted to join the march shortly.
By Friday, the critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president.
His government has been being shielded by corruption charges for several months.
In 2003, Manila’s financial district was the main scene of an attempt to mutiny against Arroyo, organized by 200 members of the army.
After less than 24 hours, the uprising failed when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet will be a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has provided itself with more than 20% stake in Versatel telecommunications.
As the company stated on Wednesday night, the average price per share is 14,46 Euros.
This represents 20.05 percent ownership of the core capital.
There were speculations about the takeover before that.
The possibility of raising a stake in Versatel remains open.
With this step, they want to help consolidate the German DSL market, said United Internet.
Prior to that, on Wednesday, there were assumptions of possible involvement after Berenberg Bank increased its share of the network operator in Düsseldorf to an additional 5 % 15,1 %.
The financial institution maintains the share to only a third party, it's reported on the money market.
The day before, United Internet already owned a narrow 10 percent of the Drillisch mobile phone company.
Within the framework of a capital increase, Drillisch has posted 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of this United Internet purchased 5,15 million shares for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, companies have initiated a dialogue on cooperation on placing DSL and mobile phone products on the market.
"Reinforcing our partnership," said a United-Internet spokesperson.
The two companies jointly established the MSP joint venture to take over the competitor Freenet.
In the beginning, the two companies were satisfied with a good 10% share in Freenet, and they did not exercise the right to take over another 18.49 percent of Freenet, said United Internet on Thursday.
However, the two companies leave all the possibilities open, in particular the increase in the shareholding in Freenet AG, the news goes on.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The poker game that has lasted around Freenet for months and can only be seen as a matter-of-case poker game is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contract mobile phone customers and 1,27 million DSL customers with fixed access.
United Internet and Drillisch's holding company had a 6,01 percent stake in Freenet.
Now we have an agreement that Drillisch will bring in another round four percent.
The right to purchase 18,49 % of Vatas investment company was agreed in August.
