Members of the Wales National Assembly are afraid to find themselves on the Muppet Show.
Some members of the National Assembly were shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The alarm arose after it came up, the name of the Assembly should be the Parliament of Wales (Welsh Parliament).
Members of different political backgrounds now fear that the new title could make them a laughing stock.
According to one Labour Representative, his faction is concerned that their new name will rhyme with the words "Twp" and "Pwp".
Not for the sake of our readers in Wales: in Welsh, twp is a simpleton, and pwp is a poop.
According to a representative of the Plaid Party, the whole faction is "unsatisfied" and therefore alternatives are proposed.
One conservative member said that his faction was "open" to name change, however he noted that the MWP was just a leap from "Muppet".
Here it is worth noting that in Welsh, the letter "w" is pronounced in the same way as the word "u" in Yorkshire, i.e. the MWP is pronounced "map".
The position of the National Assembly Committee responsible for drawing up the draft law introducing the change of name is as follows: "The final decision on the titles for the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, in the hands of the Members."
The 2017 Law governing the governance of Wales made it possible for the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation which proposed the inclusion of the Welsh Parliament and which received broad support.
As regards the addresses of Members, the Commission prefers the Welsh Parliament Member (representative of the Welsh Parliament) and its abbreviation WMP, but the public consultation favoured the MWP alternative.
Members come up with new alternatives, but the agreement is rather cumbersome, which is a problem for the President of the National Assembly, Elin Jones, who will have to submit a bill on change of name in the coming weeks.
The reform law will also affect the functioning of the National Assembly on other points, including the disqualification of Members and Commission structures.
Members will be able to vote their final vote on the issue of their own address in the course of the debate on the draft law.
Macedonia is holding a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The aim of the referendum is to put an end to a decades of debate with neighbouring Greece, a province of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbour's name is essentially territorial and has repeatedly objected to its application for EU and NATO admission.
President Gjorge Ivanov himself opposes the referendum on the change of name and is therefore not taking part in it.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing names is simply a compromise that they must conclude for their accession to the EU and NATO.
The temples in Harlem, in a difficult situation, the bells of St. Martin were silenced.
“Once upon a time, as I hear from older people, there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
"Not one of them today."
As you say, the disappearance of bars would be understandable.
“People are in different places today, ” he says.
– Bars are no longer the community living rooms where people go out every day."
As far as churches are concerned, Adams fears that selling out church assets will not fulfill the expectations of the leaders, “and in time they will be back to where they started.”
And the churches will be replaced, he adds, by residential buildings whose housing community also does not help the fate of the remaining churches.
“The vast majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he claims, “and this will continue to rush the permanent closure of churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of those who move into these apartments would join the community.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a city of blacks – the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out of the temple in the 1930s,
then occupied by a nearby black congregation.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson – the reverend is known for the leadership of boycotts against the business owners of the blacks on Harlem shopping street, 125th Street on blacks or blacks' products.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, but during the renovation the bell was built to order the community led by Reverend Johnson.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's parish, proudly referred to the bell ring as "the bells of the poor".
According to the expert who performed the bell in July, this bell game is “a cultural heritage”, “an irreplaceable, historic instrument”.
An expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first bell show in the world to be played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago joined the larger bell game at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin didn't hire anyone to replace it.
In recent months, a difficult situation has emerged in St. Martin with the participation of architects and entrepreneurs, partly involving the secular leadership of the church and partly the episcopal office.
In July, the governing body of the parish, the parish council, appealed to the bishop's office in writing, arguing that the office would "carry over the costs" to the council, although the council did not participate in the selection of architects and entrepreneurs contracted by the agency.
Some members of the community complain about the lack of transparency around the office.
Shark attacked a 13-year-old boy in California fishing for crabs
According to official reports, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy during a crab fishing season in California on Saturday.
The attack took place before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon's Beach Coast in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel on the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego said that he was diving with his friends about half an hour ago on Saturday morning when he noticed a boy crying out for help. Then he had to go with himself to help him get out of the water.
Hammel first thought that the boy was just excited because he managed to catch a crab, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “He bit me!
He bit me!"
“ His shoulder was torn apart by his clavicle, ” Hammel described what he saw when he arrived at the boy.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: “The shark is in the water,” he added.
The boy was transported by air rescue to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently being treated in critical condition.
There's no known species of shark attacking the boy.
As Chief Rescue Officer Larry Giles told the press, a few weeks earlier, sharks were detected in the area, but it was found not to be a species dangerous to humans.
Captain Giles also told me that the boy suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
The authorities closed the coast between Ponto Beach (Casablad) and Swami (Ecinitas) for 48 hours during the investigation and for safety reasons.
According to Giles, more than 135 species of sharks occur in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's would expand the British beauty market
Sainsbury's would compete with expert sellers and supermarket-style piperestands with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains.
In the midst of the decline in sales of fashion and household goods, the chain will test larger piperestands in 11 stores across the country as part of its growing growth in the British beauty market of £2.8 billion, and in the event of success they will appear in new stores as of next year.
The strengthening of the toiletry line is due to the different ways in which stores try to fill the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's said that it would double its supply of 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which it offers for the first time.
But earlier brands, L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also be located in larger areas on brand stands such as Boots and similar stores.
The store chain also restarts the Boutique make-up family, in which the majority of products are vegan – more and more young customers are looking for them today.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume distributors also test their appearance in two Sainsbury's stores, one of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the other one opens this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the spread of online purchases and food buying patterns moving towards small local trades, supermarkets need to make greater efforts to attract customers.
According to the CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, the supply will be more and more similar to retail stores, as the chain of stores tries to compete with discount stores such as Aldi and Lidl with the introduction of more services and products other than food.
Since the purchase of the two chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened the Argos classes in hundreds of stores as well as a few Habitat classes – this has also had a positive impact on food sales, so the acquisition is even more profitable.
The chain of stores failed in its previous attempt to lift the face of beauty and medicine classes.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the debate about the distribution of the proceeds of the pharmaceutical classes in its stores ended this.
The new strategy was born three years ago after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business in its 281 stores to Celesio operating the Lloyds pharmacy chain for £125 million.
According to the chain of stores, Lloyds will play a role in the strategy and offer a wider range of luxury skin care products in four shops with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
As Sainsbury's sales director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We want to create a more pleasant environment for our customers by transforming the appearance of our piperestands.
We also hired qualified staff to advise interested ones.
Our brand offer serves all needs, and the attractive environment and the convenient location provide a seductive force that brings the shopping experience to a new level."
Peter Jones "toombolt" after Holly Willoughby stopped the £11 million deal.
The Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, has left after Holly Willoughby's television programmer has withdrawn from an 11 million-pound deal on her lifestyle sales business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for the Truly brand of homewear and accessories.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand, registered by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This Morning's 37-year-old host on Instagram announced that she was quitting.
Holly Willoughby had a hell of a match for the Dragons’ Den star, Peter Jones, when she dropped out of their promising lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her very profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to some sources, Jones was “toombolt” when on Tuesday, at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, he announced in a tense discussion that he had not had enough time to devote to their joint brand, Truly, because of his new contracts worth £1.5 million.
The company of the two celebrities was previously compared to the Goop brand registered by Gwyneth Paltrow and was expected to double Willoughby’s assets estimated at £11 million.
While 37 - year - old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left the island country for one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
It was supposed to deal with this in the long run, and it gave you a livelihood over the next few decades.
Getting out was a complete surprise to everyone.
Everyone was surprised by what happened on Tuesday, since the departure was so close.
The warehouse in the Marlow office is full of goods to be sold."
According to experts, the departure of This Morning's host, one of Britain's most profit-making stars, could cost the company millions of dollars thanks to large amounts of money invested in a range of pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible slippages.
And it could also mean the end of an old friendship.
Ten years ago, the three - child host and her husband, Dan Baldwin, shared a close friendship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones took over the presidency in March.
The two couples are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production office.
Willoughby will be the M&S product face and take over Ant McPartlin as host of ITV I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones commented last night: “We don’t want to comment on [Jones]’s business affairs.”
"And then we fell in love."
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the press for his statement, which some might think was "unpresidential" and for having expressed such a positive view of the North Korean leader.
“Why did Trump give in so much?
– asked Trump in a funny "newsreaders" voice.
- I didn't let you do anything."
As you noted, Kim would like to meet for the second time after welcoming the first trial in Singapore in June as a huge step towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament, however, have fallen.
On Saturday, more than three months after the Singapore Summit in June, Ri Jongho, representing North Korea, told the UN General Assembly that, as his country sees, there will be no "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament steps.
Instead, he said that the United States would continue to maintain sanctions for pressure.
Trump put it much more optimistically in a campaign speech.
“Things are going great with North Korea, ” he said.
- We were supposed to go to war with them.
Millions of people would have been lost.
Now we have a very good relationship."
As he said, his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim had positive results – the completion of rocket tests, the release of hostages and the return of American soldiers.
He also explained why he spoke in such an unusual way about his relationship with Kim.
“Presidency is not difficult, but now there is not a crowd of tens of thousands out there trying to get in, there are only about two hundred people standing in front of me,” said Trump pointing to the group before him.
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of deaths of tsunamis and earthquakes subversive to the island.
Indonesia also rejected the help of international aid organisations after the foliage earthquake.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be evacuated, a national disaster was not reported, which would be a prerequisite for international assistance to arrive.
"In many cases earlier, it was very clear that they did not require international assistance, so our situation was a little difficult," said Sumbung.
The Save the Children Foundation is already working on a relief team to be sent to Palu, but it is not yet certain that foreigners will actually be able to participate in on-site rescues.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that the Indonesian offices are currently carrying out an evaluation of the situation in Palu to see if the involvement of international aid organisations is necessary.
Despite the continuing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country faces the destructive power of nature extremely unprepared.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh province, this is not common in other coastal areas.
Although there was a tsunami signal in place, the apparent lack of tsunami siren system in Palu also contributed to the disaster that claimed human life.
Even at the right time, transport between the Indonesian islands can be difficult.
In times of natural disasters, logistics is even more problematic.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok is on its way to Palu, but at least three days before it reaches the disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo put the development of Indonesia's worn-out infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign and did not save costs in road and rail projects.
However, before next year's elections, the Joko Government is now experiencing budget deficits.
In addition, the President has to face the ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have begun to follow a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to be evacuated because of the riots in which Christian and Muslim gangs fell on the streets with machetes, bows, arrows, and other heated weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge's huge equatorial goal against Chelsea in Liverpool
At the Premier League match in Stamford Bridge in London, with his 89th-minute goal, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool, so they didn't lose to Chelsea.
His team lost 0-1 when Sturridge received an injection about 30 metres from Chelsea Gate by Xherdan Shaqiri.
First he dropped the ball to the left, then he started a huge kick into the far corner of the gate.
The shot went high above the sixteenth and went towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally entered the net over the seeding kepa arrizabalaga.
“I just wanted to get into position, because there is always someone, like Shaq, who plays the ball forward, so I tried to put myself in the position as much as possible, ” said Sturridge, asking LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, and I just took it off, and then I didn't think much, and I shot him."
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime, after winning the lead with the Belgian star player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blues passed the ball by corner to Mateo Kovačič, and then managed to break off on the middle track and rush into Liverpool square.
After a quick injection, Kovačič started and got the ball back on the mid-field.
Then he launched Hazard to the sixteen with a beautiful handover.
Hazard ran the defense, and finally sent the ball to the far corner of Liverpool, near Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will meet Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the Stadio San Paolo arena in Naples.
Chelsea is playing against Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League.
Already 832 victims of the Indonesian tsunami
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami increased to 832, announced by the local disaster response agency on Sunday.
As a result of the 7.5 earthquake on Friday and the six-metre high tidal waves following it, several people were buried under the ruins, reported the agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The streets of Palu with a population of more than 380,000 people are covered by the ruins of the fallen buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder in the case of a stabbed woman
Police launched a murder investigation this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after a woman was found dead.
The 44-year-old woman's body covered in stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was already arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents in the area to report to anyone who's seen or dead.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is still at an early stage, however, I would like everyone in Birkenhead around John Street who may have seen or heard something to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded anything with an on-board camera, to contact us as well, because they may have information relevant to the investigation."
Police spokesperson confirmed that the murdered woman was a Birkenhead resident and was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, her friends arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found in the morning hours.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police are still notifying the victim's relatives.
A cab driver at Grayson Mews tried to get into his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed in the building for the time being and that no one was allowed to leave.
When he found out what had happened, he couldn't even speak.
The residents of the building have now been informed that it may be several hours before they can reenter the building.
One of the officers told someone that the whole building is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman struggled with tears.
"This is terrible," he repeated.
At 2:00 p.m., two police minibuses were inside the cordon and one more outside.
Within the cordon, several police officers were watching the block.
Anyone with any information should send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers on the anonymous number 0800 555 111, and refer to the September 30, 247 file.
The Parliamentary Cromwell statue is the latest victim of the history-rewriting fever
The banishment of the statue could perhaps be poetic justice for the time when Cromwell and his fanatic Puritan followers destroyed England’s cultural and religious heritage with Taliban enthusiasm.
However, according to the Cromwell Society, Crick's proposal is "foolishness", an "experiment to rewrite history".
According to Cromwell Society president John Goldsmith: “It was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell statue before Westminster Palace would eventually become a target in the current discussions on the removal of statues.
During the British Civil War, the image destruction was not ordered and executed by Cromwell.
Thus, perhaps another Cromwell may fall victim to the actions of his ancestors, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's impressive Cromwell image reflects the opinion of the 19th century and commemorates a historical figure that many people still think should be celebrated."
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is now perhaps less than at the end of the 19th century, but yet many view him as the defender of the parliament against external pressure, which, of course, was the monarchy in his case.
Whether this picture is really accurate remains the subject of a historical debate.
What is certain, however, is that this feud that erupted in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on the future of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable person representing one side of this conflict.
And it is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as a Lord protector."
Murdering pig wounded a Chinese farmer to death
According to local press, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
Only a man identified by his last name as Yuan was found covered in blood with a torn artery next to a pigsty on the market in Liupanshui, Kujzhou Province, reported the incident on Sunday at South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer is preparing to inoculate pigs in a breed on 30 May 2005 in Xining City, China, Qinghai Province.
The man traveled with his cousin from the nearby province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs at the fair.
The next morning, his cousin found the man's body and discovered that his neighbor's pighouse door was open.
According to him, the mouth of the giant boar in the pigsty had blood on it.
According to the report, the expert investigation revealed that the 250-pound pig actually bit the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mauled,” said Guiyang Evening News, a relative named Wu, only by his last name.
According to security footage, Yuan entered the pighouse on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The leader of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked away so that others could no longer be harmed while the police were investigating the crime scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reporting that they are currently negotiating compensation for the man's death.
Although not often, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a married couple on their Massachusetts farm and caused life-threatening injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound pig in Wales held a farmer for his tractor until the man’s wife managed to scare him off.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told the BBC News that although pigs are not usually prone to attack, they can become aggressive with the taste of blood.
“Very playful.
Like little children, very interested... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect," he said.
Heavy rainfall following Hurricane Rosa in the southwest region of the United States
Hurricane Rosa, as predicted, is getting weaker as it reaches over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will continue to cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and southwest parts of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa struck with winds at 140 km/h as a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 a.m., east coast time, 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure zone is formed over the Pacific Ocean and is heading west towards the western coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches Lower California on Monday, it floods the southwestern parts of the United States with heavy tropical humidity as a tropical storm.
On Monday, the storm can cause up to 25 cm of precipitation in some areas of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity meeting with approaching low - pressure masses will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Here the rainfall between 3 and 10 cm can cause sudden floods, floods of debris, landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity can also bring 5-8 cm rainfall per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, precipitation is expected in some parts from 5 to 10 cm, mainly in Arizona.
Sudden floods can occur with a rapidly decreasing intensity due to the sporadic nature of tropical rains.
Especially during tropical rains, it is not recommended to start on foot in the desert.
Heavy rains can cause the canyons to turn into roaring rivers, and thunderstorms are sometimes accompanied by sudden winds and clouds of dust.
The approaching low-pressure masses can cause heavy rainfall in some places along the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation of up to 1.5 cm is possible, which can cause small floods of debris and flat road conditions.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Sporadic tropical showers can apply on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings in Arizona, and then on Monday during the day and Tuesday the rain covers wider areas.
The heavy rain spreads to the Four Corners on Tuesday and lasts until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature fluctuations in the United States, as Arctic air masses cool down, but tropicals will remain rather warm.
This can cause drastic temperature differences at short distances.
An excellent example of this is the situation in the central region of the United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) is nearly 10 degrees.
In the coming days, it is expected that the summer heat will be felt again in larger areas.
The weather in the central and eastern parts of the United States is expected to be warm in the first half of October, and the temperature will be around 25-30 degrees from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the Northwest.
The temperature in New York City will reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 5 degrees higher than average.
According to long-term weather forecasts, the temperature in the eastern parts of the United States is likely to exceed the average temperature by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh audition
On six television channels, more than 20 million viewers followed the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of rape in the 1980s, who applied for the position of supreme judge.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate was not resolved, and the broadcasters had to interrupt the regular programme for the last-minute Friday twist: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona managed to get the FBI a week to investigate the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching him at a high school party and trying to undress him.
In Kavanaugh's passionate testimony, he said that he was 100% sure that this didn't happen.
The confessions were probably seen by more than 20.4 million viewers on Friday.
Nielsen calculated the average number of viewers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other channels for the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Nielsen also has difficulty measuring the number of people who watch the shows at work.
For the sake of comparison, there are so many spectators in the football finals or the Oscar Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel was the highest of all channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, bringing together experts to support Kavanaugh's appointment.
Second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was 3,1, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89, while CNN was watched by 2,52 million, according to Nielsen's report.
After the hearing, the interest did not drop.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued the statement that the senator was voting for Kavanaugh, it was on CNN and CBS on Friday morning, as a loud crowd of protestors received him as he was on his way to the meeting of the court committee on elevators.
He stood watched for a few minutes while the crowd scolded him, and CNN broadcasted the scene live.
“I stand before you, ” said a woman to the senator.
"Do you really think Kavanaugh is telling the truth in public?"
Others shouted to him: “You have the power to do what so many women do not.”
Flake only said that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he added that he would share his message at the committee hearing.
On cable and broadcasting channels, hours later, it was seen live, as the committee voted on whether to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate.
However, Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate in the next week, as was urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake's conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons, convinced him of this need.
Flake made up his mind following conversations with Coons and later with other senators.
Flake made good use of his power because it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's charges.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses Brexit's opponents of playing political games
In his Sunday interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the opponents of her plans to leave the European Union of jeopardising the future of the United Kingdom by playing political games and undermining the interests of the nation.
The UK Prime Minister Theresa May is arriving at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the front page of the newspaper next to May's interview, May's former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, attacks May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the suggestion that Britain and the EU handle each other's customs is "absolutely absurd".
The Wayde Sims Murder: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of killing the player of the LSU
Police have arrested a suspect in the 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU), the death of Wayde Sims.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested on charges of violent manslaughter, reported by Baton Rouge's police department.
The police released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and they also reported that Sims' glasses fell during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and Simpson's DNA on the WAFB channel in the CBS network.
After they interrogated Simpson, the police announced that the young man confessed to shooting Sims.
According to Advocate's report, the court set bail at $350,000.
According to a preliminary report from the coroner of East Baton Rouge County on Friday, the cause of death was a gunshot wound to both the head and the neck.
The Office thanked the Louisiana state police for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the competent law enforcement forces for their "committed and persevering work in finding out the truth".
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter-high attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also the basketball player of the LSU.
Sims reached a 5.6 point and 2.6 bounce average in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the news of Sims' death "struck" and "shocked" the team.
"You're always afraid of something like this happening," said Wade.
Volcano floods Mexico City with ashes
The ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
After the volcanic activity in the crater increased and a total of 183 gas and ash discharges occurred within 24 hours, the national disaster prevention centre asked the Mexican population to stay away from the volcano.
The center also observed several rumblings and tremors.
The images on the social media in some districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, cover the windscreens of cars with a thin layer of ash.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the Mexican capital after an earthquake of 7.1 hit the central region of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police collided with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the Independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona, after the independence protesters fought with the police and thousands joined rival protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s split-off referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and paint powder at the riot police, so the streets that used to be crowded with tourists were now covered with dense dust paint.
Later in the day, further fights broke out, during which police tried to maintain order with a baton.
The "We Don't Forget, We Don't Forgive" sloganist groups of independence groups and the pro-unit protesters behind the slogan "Live Spain" faced each other for hours.
According to local press reports, 14 people were treated with minor injuries during the demonstrations.
The tensions continue to remain in the region of independence driven by the referendum on 1 October, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The voters voted by a large majority in favour of separation, although the participation rate was rather low, as most of the Unionists boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people suffered injuries last year when police tried to stop voting in polling stations with aggressive confrontational actions.
On Friday, the independence groups were on the streets all night to prevent demonstrations supporting the national police.
Although it could not be prevented, the demonstration did not end up on the normal route.
According to the 68 - year - old electrician Narcis Termes, who participated in separatist demonstrations, there is no chance that Catalonia will gain its independence.
“It was one of the best times of our lives.
I have seen my parents tear tears of joy for us to vote for, but now our cause has been sunk," he said.
Although last December's regional elections have succeeded in achieving an important victory, even if it is a tight one, it is difficult for Catalan parties to maintain their momentum this year, after many of their best-known leaders have gone into voluntary exile or are awaiting an arrest for their role in organising the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
According to the 42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded a police protest on his phone, the conflict was fired on both sides by politicians.
"The situation is getting tenser," he says.
Negotiations have been announced by Oriol Junqueras, a Catalan leader who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, on Saturday, that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
"I can most strongly reject the devaluation of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish Government represents by taking part in the European elections as a candidate," he said.
Londonderry: Police arrested three men who drove their cars into the same house
Police arrested a 33, a 34 and a 39-year-old man who drove his car to the same house several times in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 a.m. British summer time.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building itself were damaged.
At any given moment, they may even have shot the car with a crossbow.
With Menga goal, Livingston beat the Rangers team 1-0
With Dolly Menga's first goal, he secured Livingston's victory.
Livingston, fresh in first class, surprised the Rangers team by adding Steven Gerrard to his second defeat, who has been coaching the ibroxi club since 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's goal was the real difference because Gary Holt's team was in a dead race with the Hibernian team in second place.
So the Gerrards have remained without a foreign victory in the current season of the Scottish League, and next Sunday they will face the number one Hearts team, who are eight points behind.
Before that, however, the Rangers still have a match on Thursday in the European League against Rapid Wien.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased its division's unbeatable series to six victories, which means that last month Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller, hasn't lost with the team yet.
Livingston has missed a number of situations against the inaccurate guest team
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the only goal of the match, as their attack game caused many problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the opponent's defense, but he pulled the attack too far, and Alan Lithgow's attempt was wide after he slipped in to reach Craig Halkett's cross-head ball in front of the goal line.
The home team let the Rangers play their own game, as they were sure they could disturb the guests in the recorded game situations.
The decisive goal came from a situation exactly like this.
The Rangers had a free kick, and Livingston found a hole in their defense. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created a situation for Menga, who took advantage of it from the middle of sixteen.
At this stage of the game, the Rangers led in ball possession, but domestic protection remained unbreakable, and Liam Kelly's gate was barely compromised.
This trend continued during the second half of the match, except in one situation when Kelly had to defend Alfredo Morelos's attack.
Scott Pittman's goalie, Allan McGregor, had his foot down, and Lithgow missed another free kick from Livingston.
The transverse balls were constantly arriving in the sixteenth place of Livingston, but the defenders fought each time. The assault team did not receive two punitives: one Halkett as a replacement player for Glenn Middleton's entrance and the other for his hand-holding.
“Fenomenal” game from Livingston – match analysis
From the Tony Macaroni Arena, Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland correspondent
Livingston had a phenomenal performance and took credit for it.
Players were all excellent performers and exceeded expectations.
The team's members and style of play has hardly changed since they returned to the forefront, but Holt's efforts deserve great recognition, as the coach has been very uplifted since his arrival.
Several players have taken their best form.
Halkett's team captain has made a tremendously organized defense, and Menga has made Connor Goldson and Joe Worral sweat.
The Rangers played without an idea.
No matter how well they perform under Gerrard's leadership at times, they were unable to take that level now.
The last shot was always missing from the formula – they only managed to break the domestic protection once anyway – so the Rangers had to get back together quickly, as they slipped back into the middle of the field.
Erdoğan found mixed welcome in Cologne
He described the morning meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) in Berlin.
This was the last day of Erdoğan's divisive visit to Germany to improve relations between NATO countries.
The relationship between the two countries has deteriorated because of issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's membership of the EU.
Erdoğan then traveled to Cologne for the opening ceremony of a newly built large mosque.
The city of Cologne is home to the largest community of Turks living outside Turkey.
The police banned the assembly of 25 000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many of the president's supporters appeared to see the Turkish head of state.
In addition, hundreds of protestors against Erdoğan, including several Kurds, expressed their displeasure with Erdoğan's policy and the German Government's decision to receive the head of state.
The two opposing demonstrations are an example of the division of the President's policy, which some Turkish-born German citizens celebrate as heroes, while others see autocrats in them.
Road accident in Deptford: hit a bicycle car and lost his life
A cyclist lost his life collided with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a high traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics tried to help the cyclist, but he lost his life at the scene.
The crash occurred only a few months after another bicycle hit-and-run was killed on Childers Street, just a mile from the scene of the Saturday accident.
According to the London Police Department, the police continue to work on establishing the identity of the man in order to notify the relatives.
Due to the investigation, roadblocks and bus lines are making traffic difficult, and the authorities advise car drivers to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six prison guards were injured during a riot
Six prison guards were injured during the riots in a highly guarded man prison, announced by the prison board.
The riots started on Sunday morning at 09:30 in Long Lartin Penitentiary in Worcestershire, and they have not been contained yet.
In order to deal with the situation, the special forces called “Tornado” were deployed on the scene. Eight prisoners were involved in the riots, who were confined to a wing of buildings.
The members of the special forces suffered only minor head injuries that they managed to treat at the scene.
Statement by the spokesperson of the penitentiary organization: “Specially trained prison guards handle the situation in Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six members of the team had to be treated for injury.
We will not tolerate violence at any level in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and you will be facing further prison sentences."
More than 500 prisoners are being held in Long Lartin men's prison, among whom the most dangerous criminals in the country are.
In June, it was reported that the warden of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the special forces also needed help to overcome a serious disturbance in which prisoners attacked the prison staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a sudden flood (but the situation in drought-stricken areas may improve)
Arizona is rarely hit by tropical depressions, but it is expected that the state will have to deal with this at the beginning of next week when the remnant of the hurricane called Rosa sweeps through the desert southwest, dramatically increasing the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already ordered flood preparations from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeastern parts of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to travel straight through the city of Phoenix on Tuesday, where it is expected to arrive Monday night and bring with it heavy rains.
The Phoenix Weather Service posted the following message on Twitter: “Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones have reached within the 200 mile radius of Phonenix in the form of a tropical storm or depression!
Hurricane Katrina, for example, approached the border of AZ 40 miles away in 1967."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 50-100 mm precipitation, which can reach 150 mm in extreme cases, such as Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other parts of the southwestern desert areas (Central Rockies, Great Basin, etc.) 25 to 50 mm precipitation can be expected, but in some places 100 mm can fall.
The rain Rosa has brought may bring relief to areas not threatened by lightning floods, as the area is currently suffering from severe drought.
Despite the fact that floods are a serious threat, some of the rainfall can have a beneficial effect on the southwestern regions with drought.
“According to the US drought monitoring service, more than 40% of Arizona’s territory is affected by a minimum extreme drought, which is the second most dangerous category,” says weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will first land on the peninsula of Lower California, Mexico.
It will remain hurricane-like, and on Sunday morning, bringing up to 137 km/h of wind, it will travel some 600 km south of the Punta Eugenia land language in Mexico and will go north at approximately 19 km/h.
The storm in the Pacific is facing colder currents, and it will lose its power.
Thus, Mexico’s shores are expected to return as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rainfall is expected, which significantly increases the chance of floods.
“ Rainfalls can lead to an average rainfall of between 70 and 150 mm from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora, where there may be 250 mm rainfall,” reports weather.com.
Rosa then continues as a tropical storm across Mexico northwards before reaching Arizona’s border in the early hours of Tuesday, in the form of tropical depression, to reach the southern regions of Utah on Tuesday nights, swept across Arizona.
“The greatest danger posed by Rosa and her remains will be the extraordinary rainfall in Lower California, Northwest Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” said the National Hurricane Centre.
Rainfalls are expected to cause life-threatening lightning floods and deluge flows in desert areas, and landslides in mountainous areas are to be feared.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16 - year - old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
On Saturday, at 4 a.m. local time, an injured teenage boy was found in Midsomer Norton’s Excelsior Terrace.
The boy was immediately taken to the hospital, and his condition is stable.
According to police statements, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested in Radstock, Avon, and Somerset during the night.
Authorities are asking the public to contact them if anyone has a mobile phone record.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh had to suffer the "dignity and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"Whoever votes for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump at the meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
According to Trump, Kavanaugh's candidacy meant that the Democratic Party "had to suffer its ill will and wrath".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he strongly and passionately denied Christine Blasey Ford’s claim that the man had committed sexual violence against her decades earlier as a teenager.
At the hearing, Ford testified and stood up for his earlier claims.
On Saturday, the president said that "the Americans could see for themselves" Kavanaugh's "brilliant and fearless character" that day.
“The votes cast next to Judge Kavanaugh are votes cast alongside one of the best legal experts of our time, who has an immaculate public service record,” declared Trump’s supporters in West Virginia.
The president was referring secretly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
“Only five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running in person, but I'm actually running, he said.
“That’s why I go everywhere to support the best candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats were following the tactic of "resistance and obstruction".
The first Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, said a leading Republican advisor to CNN.
Hundreds have died in a tsunami caused by an earthquake in Indonesia, and the number of dead is rising.
Many were swept away by the flood, and at least 384 people were killed when the huge waves hit the shore, and the disaster was caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami on the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, declared on Saturday by local authorities.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the waves nearly six metres (18 feet) high reached the shore at dusk, swept many away and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 earthquake.
“When yesterday the tsunami warning was sounded, people simply stayed on the beach, didn’t escape immediately, so they became victims of the waves,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian Emergency Response Agency (BNPB) at the Jakarta press conference.
“The tsunami didn’t just come by itself, it carried cars, logs, houses and everything else off the coast," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h on the high seas before it reached the coast.
Some people climbed up to the top of the trees and escaped, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palun.
The aerial images published by the Agency of the disaster show numerous destroyed buildings and business premises, several twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, further aftershocks shook the coastal city.
Earthquakes were detected in an area where some 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the earthquake on Friday released approximately 200 times more energy than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The agency added that the city was located at the end of a long and narrow bay and that the resulting geographical conditions could have enhanced the effect of the tsunami.
According to Nugroho, the damage was “significant”, thousands of houses were destroyed in the disaster, and hospitals, shopping centres, and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, and added that the number of victims so far was 540, and they were looking for 29 more.
According to Nugroho's statement, the number of injured people and the damage caused in the area called Donggala on the coast of Palu 300 km (190 miles) may be even greater as it was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication “fully paralyzed, no information is available” about Donggala, said Nugroho.
"More than 300 000 people live there," says the Red Cross Communication, which also announced that the organisation's experts and volunteers are on their way to the disaster area.
"The situation is already tragic, but it can be much worse", they added.
The agency received a number of criticisms on Saturday that it had not informed the population about the Palut tsunami, but the management said that the waves had reached the shore as soon as the alert was issued.
In one of the amateur videos shared on social media, you can see a man on the upper floor of a building trying to warn the people on the street of the approaching tsunami with desperate cries.
In a few minutes, a huge water wall will hit the beach, pushing cars and buildings with it.
The Reuters news agency has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the recording yet.
The earthquake and the tidal wave caused a power outage, making it impossible to communicate around Palu, making it harder for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army has sent relief from Jakarta and other cities with cargo aircraft, but authorities believe that the evacuated population will continue to need food and other basic necessities.
The airport of the city was opened only in order to facilitate relief work and is closed until October for all other purposes.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centres set up by Palun on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The World Vision team arrived safely from Donggala to the city of Palu, where the employees found shelter under the tent tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of the office, but during their journey they encountered traces of terrible destruction, said Doseba.
“They said they saw a lot of ruined houses, ” he added.
- It's very bad."
While relief teams began preparing for disaster response work, some complained that foreign experts with extensive experience in this area could not travel to Palura.
According to Indonesian regulations, any aid, aid shipments and personnel coming from overseas may only be allowed into the territory of the country if the disaster site is declared a disaster area at national level.
This hasn't happened so far.
“The case continues to be treated as a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
– As soon as the government acknowledges that this is indeed a national disaster, we can let international aid services in, but no announcement has been made yet."
On the second night after Friday’s quake and tsunami, Palun’s friends and family members continued to hope that their loved ones would be among those whose miraculous escape would bring some light into the dark atmosphere of reports about natural disasters.
On Saturday, during the rescue work, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the workers managed to free a woman who was trapped in the ruins for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paraglider team, prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which was held in Indonesia at the beginning of the month.
Other students besides the missing ones were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi.
"As a Veteran paraglider, what happened puts a heavy burden on me," he said.
Gendon recalled that when news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began to spread among the paragliders, he spent hours desperately trying to reach whatsapp competitors who had just participated in the beach festival in Palun.
However, in addition to the messages, only one grey pipe appeared instead of two blue ticks.
"I think that means that messages could no longer be delivered," he said.
$26,750 was stolen while uploading an ATM at Newport on the Levee shopping center
On Friday morning, thieves robbed $26,750 from a staff member at Brink’s, who was charging an ATM with cash at the Newport on the Levee Mall, in a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The CIT car driver was emptying out an ATM at the entertainment center, and he was preparing to fill it with additional bills, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the announcement.
A man “approached his Brink’s employee from behind” while busy with his work and stole one of the prepared money bags.
Witnesses have seen several suspected perpetrators fleeing the scene, but the police statement does not indicate the exact number of suspects.
Anyone with information on the identity of the perpetrators can contact the NYPD at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper's name changed to Yé
Kanye West, the rapper's name is now Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday with the following message: "The creature formerly called Kanye West."
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time now, and that was the title of her eighth album released in June.
He announced the change of name before Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons," said the producer.
The new name is not only an abbreviation of the rapper's current artistic name – according to his earlier revelations it has religious significance for West.
“I understand that “Ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you”, ” West mentioned earlier when talking to the radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
- So I'm you and I'm us and we're all one.
Kanye means the only thing that's ever become is Ye, which represents the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album rather reflects who we really are."
Ye is one of those famous rappers who likes to change their names.
Sean Combs, for example, has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he now prefers Love and Brother Love.
West's former co-author, JAY-Z, also varied several times by whether his name should be written in a single, hyphen, or in capital letters.
The Mexican president vowed not to use the army against civilians.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador promised never to use the force against civilians in connection with the upcoming 50th anniversary of student protests in the bloodbath.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Tlatellco Square that “he would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military troops in the square opened fire on participants in a peaceful demonstration, causing the death of some 300 people, when left-wing student movements showed signs of strengthening in Latin America.
López Obrador promised to help young people in Mexico – giving students monthly benefits and plans to set up additional free state universities.
He argued that unemployment and lack of education are the two main factors that drive young people into the arms of criminal organizations.
The US should double the funding framework for AI solutions
As China becomes increasingly active in the research and development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for such research, said Kai-Fu Lee, investor and employer of artificial intelligence solutions who used to work for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said that after the U.S. government made reports on artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has also announced its plans to become the world's number one AI developer by 2030.
"Doubting the budget for MI research would be a good start, as all other countries are significantly behind the US and the next breakthrough in the MI area is imminent," said Lee.
By doubling research funding, the chances of the United States taking the next big step in the field of artificial intelligence could double, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Super Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was published this month in the care of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that managed to defeat the best American Othello player, and later he worked as a member of Microsoft Research's management and Chairman of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the results of technology competitions previously announced by the US government, including the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next event would take place, because it would be possible to find new future shapers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain the state support they need for their research, said Lee.
"China is not stealing scientific leaders, but large companies", he added.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have contracted several major university skulls to work in the AI area.
Lee believes that changing immigration policy could also greatly help the US's aspirations in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that people with doctoral degrees in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically receive a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China's national science fund provides support to academic institutions in a similar way, as the US National Science Fund (NSF) and other governmental organisations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, explained Lee.
This year, the US Department of Defence established Joint Artificial Intelligence Center MI, where various industry professionals and academics can work together, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee called Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next,
NSF is currently spending $100 million a year to support AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation, which planned the establishment of a National Security MI Committee, has not taken any further steps for months.
A referendum is held in Macedonia to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in the Sunday referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. This step would resolve a conflict with Greece that lasted several decades, which prevented the adoption of the country’s application for membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece, a province of which is called Macedonia, argued that the name of its northern neighbour indicates that it is seeking a Greek area with a similar name, and has thus far vetoed NATO and EU membership of the country.
In June, the two governments negotiated a deal on the new name of the state, but according to national emotional opponents, the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov stated that he would not take part in the referendum, and as a result of the boycott campaign launched, it became doubtful whether the 50% participation required for the valid referendum would be achieved.
The question on the ballots reads as follows: "Do you support NATO and EU membership of the country and do you accept the agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price should be paid in order to give Macedonia a chance to become a member of the EU and NATO as one of the emerging countries in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of this country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it would mean a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the referendum itself is not legally binding, sufficient members of Parliament have stated that they feel bound by the outcome of the vote.
A two-thirds majority is needed in Parliament to change names.
According to the State Election Committee, no irregularities were reported until 13:00 on the day of the vote.
However, the participation rate reached only 16% up to this point. This figure was 34% in the 2016 parliamentary elections (with 66% of registered voters).
“I came to vote for my children, because we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62), who voted in Skopje, the capital.
Zoran Zaev, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko, voted in favour of the name change at the referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, which would allow the country to join the EU and NATO.
In Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) set up a small stage and chairs and tents for boycotts.
"We also support the country's NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with pride, with our heads up, and not through the servants' door," said Kavadarkov.
– We are a poor country, but we have not lost our dignity.
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia, then we can also turn to China or Russia as part of the Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would be able to deal with investments in Macedonia that the country with unemployment above 20% needs.
"I believe that the majority will support our cause, as more than 80% of the country's population basically supports EU and NATO membership," said Zaev after voting.
He also added that the "yes" vote means "insuring the future of the country".
According to the results of a survey published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, 30-43% of voters are expected to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the required participation rate.
Based on another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, a participation rate of 57% is expected on Sunday.
For those who want to vote, 70% said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the participation rate must be at least 50% by one vote.
The nullity of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the West Party government, which came to power in May of last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City's player, scores a goal by taking out the entire Brighton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling thoroughly managed to protect Brighton, so Manchester City won a 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, England.
Aguero scored his 65th-minute goal like it was the easiest thing in the world.
As the first step of the attack, the Battle of Argentina received a pass on the midfield, and
He got out in the open between the three Brighton defenders.
Then four green jerseys surrounded Aguero.
He dodged a defenseman, then ran down more when he got to the 16th in Brighton.
Then he passed left to Sterling who showed up there.
The English warrior has already given the ball back to Aguero within the sixteenth, who finished the operation with his right foot, hitting the right side of the bedroom guard Mathew Ryan's gate in Brighton.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” said reporters Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City.
– We agreed that you could play 55, up to 60 minutes.
And that's how it happened.
Fortunately, that's when he scored a goal."
With Sterling's action, the blues managed to gain the initial advantage in the English championship battle.
The goal was born in the 29th minute, when
Aguero, who's in the Brighton area, got a great pass.
He started a beautiful cross-ball on the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane played the ball for a while before he started Sterling long.
By the battle of the blues, he could barely flick the ball into the gate before he slipped outside the baseline.
The City will be playing with the Hoffenheim team in the Champions League in Rhein-Neckar Arena, Sinsheim, Germany, from 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to make things harder for the Rockies.
Since the Nationals team missed their chance to get into the after-season, they had no reason to really try.
However, the ever-competiting Scherzer can't wait to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the opponent team still has a chance in the playoffs. Rockies have a game advantage in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West baseball league.
The Rockies have secured at least one comfort zone with their 5-2 victory against Nationals on Friday night, but their first division title is still pending.
“Whether or not we have a chance, we can stand up to them by saying that the atmosphere of the audience and the other team in Denver is expected to peak now compared to the whole year.
Of course I'm in the mood for a career."
The Nationals team still has to pick the starting player for Sunday, but according to the news, Scherzer will be the pitcher in this situation.
Scherzer, who took a pitching session on Thursday, will have his 34th pitch on Sunday, which is usually his rest day.
The right hand player in Washington this season is 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts after 220 and 2/3.
Trump is campaigning in West Virginia.
The president also implicitly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Justice candidate Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters' participation in the interim elections.
"Everything we have done so far is at stake in November.
We're only five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the greats, the greats – I am not personally running, but I am actually going, so I am going everywhere to support the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “Everyone can see what these terrible radical democrat groups are doing, and they can see it for themselves.
They are truly determined, and they are able to use whatever means they need to regain power, to see malice and vileness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they trample so that they can have control, they have power, that's what they want, control and power, but we don't let ourselves be."
According to the president, democrats use "resistance and obstruction".
"They have seen all this in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive and malicious and mean and lying".
He referred by name to Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, a member of the Senate's Judicial Affairs Committee, who expressed a loud displeasure to the assembled crowd.
“Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, what?
No, uh, no, wait – all with very bad body language, that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer supports diversity.
You don't tolerate people who say what they're thinking freely.
I was not at all surprised when the Momentum activists in my party decided to censor me.
After all, I am only the last in a long line of Labour MEPs who have been told that they are not welcome, simply because we have said what we are thinking.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan has been treated in the same way for standing firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship didn't like the fact that I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, which, ironically, are precisely those issues in which Jeremy also disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that they wanted a "hostive and productive meeting".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour Representative, these Friday evening meetings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today, the tone has changed, and the promise of a more "restrained, polite" policy has been forgotten, if at all.
It is becoming increasingly noticeable that disparate views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and all opinions are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party's leadership.
This trend began shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the couple, and my colleagues, with whom I thought we had a similar political attitude, have recently been expecting me to turn my back on my individual opinion and take a stand for things that I would never otherwise agree on, whether it is national security or the single European market.
After all my public speeches, no matter what I actually said, they are starting to vilify me on social media sites, demand my redemption, criticise the policy at the center, and tell me that I should not even be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am luckier than many of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me tend to be limited to politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my political colleagues who are forced to resist sexist and racist attacks on a daily basis, but do not run away.
The most disappointing aspect of today's policy is that this level of attack has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn spoke last week about the Labour Party's need to promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is, however, that we have renounced diversity, and with every "untrust" motion and every modification of the electoral rules, the circle of the people tolerated in the party is shrinking.
In recent years, many have advised me to hold back, not be so explicit, and then “it will be all right”.
However, that is not why I took political action.
32 years ago, I joined the Labour Party as a student because I was upset that the Thatcher government had neglected the schools so much that our classroom was almost crumbling, and then I fought for better public services for the most deprived, both as local councillor and government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, nor have I done otherwise in the last election.
In Nottingham East, it was very clear to everyone what political positions I represent and on which issues I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who supported the motion on Friday, I would like to say that in this situation, when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will not only harm families, but also companies and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to spend so much time and effort questioning my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
My most important message, however, is not for the members of the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that any threat of redemption or political purpose will not discourage me from acting in my own opinion and taking everyone's interests into account.

Ayr-Melrose 38-17: Ayr strikes the top undefeated
Two late attempts have slightly modified the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr’s deserved victory will be achieved in the most fun game of the day, Tennent’s Premiership.
The team is currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team in the ten teams.
Thanks to their unique protection and superior use of position, they prevailed, so the domestics and coach Peter Murchie have every reason to be satisfied.
"We've had to meet a number of challenges in our previous matches, but we're still undefeated, so I have every reason to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie, the Melrose player, said: “We have to admit that Ayr has taken much more advantage of its situation than we have.
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt to make Frazier Climo, Ayr took the lead. Thanks to the yellow card to Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, loaned by Warriors, Melrose could have made the difference, but Jason Baggot's attempt did not make it a point.
Climo sweated the Ayr's defense with a penalty, right at halftime, then scored a point from a one-man experiment, so the first half ended with a 17-5 in favor of Ayr.
Melrose had a strong start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt was to sell Baggo, reducing the team's downside to five points.
Then the game lasted a long time, as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and had to be taken off the court, and in the sequel Ayr further increased his advantage by trying Stafford McDowall, whose laurels were reaped with Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, got a yellow card, and then Melrose managed to stop Bruce Colvine's experiment in a predominance, thereby breaking the pressure on them.
The home team started catching up again, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for demobilizing Climbo without a ball, MacPherson presented a touchdown from the penalty line behind the Ayr's storming team.
Climo sold it, which he repeated almost immediately after starting over, when Kyle Rowe took off David Armstrong's high kick and sent Gregor Henry out for his fifth try at home.
The main character of Still Game has started a new career in the catering industry
It seems that one of the stars of Still Game, Ford Kieran, is moving towards the catering industry, and it has been discovered that he has taken the lead in a company that manages restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes together and plays together with his old comedian, Greg Hemphill.
The doubles have announced that the next ninth season will be the final season, and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the news, although a source of the Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan was trying to benefit from Glasgow's "bloomy hospitality industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol around the naval command center decorated with sailboats in La Paz.
There are ocean blue flags on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon proclaim the motto: “We have the right to go to the sea.
It's our duty to get it back."
In Bolivia, with no coast, the lost shore remains vivid, which was taken by Chile in a bloody 19th - century conflict for resources, and there is a strong desire to rewind the waves of the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes have perhaps been most powerful for many decades, since Bolivia is awaiting the October 1st ruling of the International Court of Justice, which concludes five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the ball, which floods people with the spirit of cohesion and peace, who look forward to a positive outcome,” said a Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice on screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will stand up for Bolivia, and Chile will be obliged to sit at a negotiating table after decades of rapsodical attitudes in order for Bolivia to have independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic, native president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle to continue for next year's reelection, has a lot to lose with Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much if its decision were to be beneficial to Bolivia.
The United Nations Panel in the Netherlands has no power to judge Chilean territories and has also stipulated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered less than six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert in international law.
In addition, the last four years have not only helped Bolivia's case, but have even rejected it.
“The issue of the sea exit has been diverted by the current Bolivian government for its own purposes,” said Zárate.
– Morales' hostile rhetoric has caused the remaining goodwill of the Chileans to fade away."
Bolivia and Chile will certainly continue negotiations at some point, but after what has happened, it will be extremely difficult to initiate dialogue.
The two countries have not delegated ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees with the finding that the court ruling would have been unusually rapid.
Monday brings Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity to open a new chapter in relations with Chile" and "a chance to get both of them out of the closure of 139 years of conflict," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the maritime debate to turn it into a political advantage.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to the Pacific, ” he added.
“The judgment gives us the opportunity to see that it is time to move on from the past.”
North Korea: no nuclear disarmament until they can trust America
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho says his country won't be the first to disarm its nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at the Singapore Summit of the leaders of the two rival countries.
The comment was made when it appeared that US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo was able to resume the stalled nuclear negotiations more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong-gun.
According to Ri, "I desire" to believe that the continued sanctions and the American obstruction of the Korean war declaration will ever be enough to bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is afraid of accepting the statement if Pyongyang does not take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim Jongun and US President Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, there is widespread scepticism surrounding Pyongyang's commitment to disarming the arsenal, which is likely to be the only key to the country's security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows showed the huge hats that will soon appear in top-class shops
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of unusually oversized hats as part of their spring/summer 2019 collection, which was received with great enthusiasm by the stylish audience of the Paris Fashion Week.
Hats are not practical in the summer, and the above fashion designers have put their outstanding works on the runway.
Valentino's most spectacular piece was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a feather-like, wide flange and almost completely absorbed the heads of the models.
Among the other oversized accessories appeared gem - embellished watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat, and even a pineapple that was not really designed to keep a person’s head warm.
Thom Browne also brought up a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their mouths sewn together and reminded me of Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One of these pieces looked like a scuba mask with a pipe and glasses, and another one looked like a melting cone of ice cream.
If you like these spectacular pieces, you're in luck.
According to style analysts' predictions, giant hats may be on their way to top-class clothing stores.
Oversized hats follow the path trampled by "La Bomb", a straw hat with a width of 60 cm, which we have seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the less practical hat that conquers social media shows another piece on the runway: a beach bag made of straw, almost the size of the swimsuit model that carries it.
The dark orange raffia bag – decorated by raffia bootes and a white leather trap on top – was one of the outstanding pieces of Jacquemus' spring/summer La Riviera collection in 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, said to FEMAIL: “I expect huge hats and beach bags to appear in top-class clothing stores next summer. The designer has created such an elemental effect that it would be difficult to deny the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The Scottish independent schools have traditionally provided excellent education. In view of the new outstanding exam results, this situation has not changed since 2018, which is further enhanced by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other community initiatives.
In Scotland, more than 30 000 students are already studying in such institutions, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strive to provide students and parents with the best possible services.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, higher education, their chosen careers and their position as world citizens.
In an educational sector where it is possible to design and introduce tailor-made school curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after subjects.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, it reaches his head.
But if you speak his language, it will reach his heart."
This is an important reminder because we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's exam results show that students from independent schools across the country have produced the best results in foreign languages.
68 percent of all students studying foreign languages reached a higher A (more than 85 percent).
Based on the data collected from SCIS 74 member schools, 72 percent of students received a higher grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent French and 63 percent of Spanish reached A.
These results also support the fact that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as essential knowledge, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today languages, as chosen objects, have become as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in independent and other schools.
The 2014 UK Employment and Vocational Training Committee survey showed that 17 percent of employers say that filling empty positions is difficult due to a lack of language skills.
This also shows that language skills are becoming more and more necessary for young people to have a successful career.
As the knowledge of foreign languages is expected in more and more workplaces, language skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career you choose, if you have learned a foreign language, you will gain lifelong knowledge that brings clear benefits.
The ability to communicate directly with other nationalities automatically confers a competitive advantage on multilingual applicants.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which 4,000 adults were interviewed in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were not well enough in any foreign language to communicate with others, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10% (15 percent) of respondents.
This is why it is important to put emphasis on children's language teaching at this time.
Speaking in several languages, especially in the language of developing countries, can be a tool in the hands of children with which they can be better able to apply for more important work as adults.
In Scotland, different languages will be dealt with in every school.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while more will teach languages such as Mandarin and Japanese, which are expected to be of paramount importance for the UK by 2020.
Whatever the area of interest of the child, it will be able to learn several languages at independent schools and will be trained by instructors who are experts in their field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment for children that prepares and provides them with the skills they will need to succeed, whatever the future may save.
It is not difficult to see that, in the current global business environment, languages continue to be vital for a country's future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, knowledge of modern languages should be treated as "international communication skills".
Independent schools offer young people in Scotland the possibility of choice, diversity and quality education.
Il faut bien le faire – this is how it should be.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron shows up at San Diego with Lakers on Sunday
It won't be long before the fans sit on their pins and needles to see LeBron James enter the field for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is going to play for the opening match on Sunday season against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes you're gonna spend on the field, that's a question.
“More than one and less than 48,” wrote Walton on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited period of time.
After training a few days ago, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers in the six-game preseason.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to play in the early season to be ready," he replied.
Trump's West Virginia Campaign and YouTube Channel
Donald Trump starts a long series of campaign events in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This will be the first of Trump's five announced events next week, including stops such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote confirming his candidate for the vacant seat of the Supreme Court has been postponed, Trump is trying to gather supporters for the upcoming mid-term elections, as there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of Congress when the votes run in November.
When does Trump's West Virginia event start tonight, and where do you follow him online?
Trump's speech in Wheeling (West Virginia) starts tonight, i.e. on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 7 Eastern Time.
Trump's West Virginia meeting can also be followed online through YouTube live streaming.
Trump is likely to be affected by this week's hearing by his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, which has proved particularly tense in light of sexual harassment charges, and the Senate's confirmation vote has been suspended for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
However, the primary objective of the sudden increase in events is to help Republicans before the November elections.
According to Trump's campaign advisor, next week's five events "are for the activation of voters and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority that they currently own in the Senate and the House of Representatives," says Reuters.
“To be able to control Congress, it is so critical of its political plans that the President visits as many states as possible. We are looking at a busy campaign period,” reported a campaign spokesperson asking Reuters to conceal his name.
The event planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling tonight "He can bring supporters from the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and even be included in media coverage in Pittsburgh," says West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help his West Virginia Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who, according to the polls, is not in a favourable position.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to intercede personally to be better on the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: the American team fights with full shoulders in front of the Sunday individual to keep hope alive
After three one-sided attempts, the Ryder Cup needed the four matches on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of luck and moment is a fairly air-based sports concept, yet every player believes in it, most of all in tournaments like the Ryder Cup.
So who's got the ball now?
“They had a six-point lead, and they only have four more, so we can say that we have the ball,” said Jordan Spieth, as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, there are still four points ahead of Europe, and twelve more can be obtained.
The Americans, as Spieth tells us, feel that they have finally received a small backwind and can draw encouragement from more than one, including Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and both scored three points out of four.
Spieth proved to be infallible from the initial punch to the hole, and his performance was exemplary.
His otters of victory grew louder as he proceeded with the circle, hit and equalized in the fourth match, with him and Thomas at double disadvantage after two.
The final round of the match at the 15 hole resulted in a similar shout of joy, a kind that can make the audience believe that the American team is not losing everything yet.
“You just have to dig deep inside yourself and mind your own game,” said Spieth.
That's exactly what's waiting for the players.
18 holes for a chance for you to leave a mark.
In the last two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the most popular pair of the Ryder Cup, have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas.
Europe is strange, but its adorable pair has brought four out of four, and they seem to be able to make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not perform above par on Saturday afternoon, and they performed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine stages of Friday morning.
Thanks to this series and the dynamics between them and their loudly supportive audiences, they have become the standard by Sunday, and no one is more expected to see the Sun secure Europe's victory on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
The best thing would be a win at the same time, with different holes.
However, it is still too early to celebrate the victory of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon executed Sergio García, the hero of the morning, when he played with Alex Noren.
Once and twice, the first nine holes above the par were hit by the Spanish and the Swedish, which pushed them into a downhill where they had no chance to get out.
Sunday, on the other hand, there will be no one to help you out of your hole.
Four-ball games and four-games are extremely entertaining in close-up view thanks to the couple's interactions. You can watch who gives advice, which they do not give, and how the strategy can change in a heartbeat.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant advantage for the last day, but this section four has shown that the American team has the courage to fight, even though it has been missed by many, especially from the American side.
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 advantage
Europe can start the last day of the Ryder Cup with a positive advantage after closing Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches against the United States with a 10-6 result.
The dynamic Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the hair, winning two victories against the Sick Bay Tiger Woods, raising the difference between Le Golf National and four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who is trying to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the constantly failing American team during the four-ball games in the morning, winning the series to 3-1.
America had more resistance in the fours, bringing in two matches, but they still couldn't make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team should score eight points from Sunday's 12 individual games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a series, while he and Molinari – who are only known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the second pair of Ryder Cup history, which scored four points in four opening matches.
After beating the Woods-Patrick Reed team in the four-ball game, they defeated the unmotivated Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau to a definite 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes even gleamed his talent, but lost 19 of his 29 matches, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four-ballers, returned to her partner, Henrik Stenson, and in the fours they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the world ranking first and third.
However, Europe has not succeeded in everything on this pleasant, windy day, southwest of Paris.
The three-time defending officer Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the Americans how to do it on Saturday.
They won a painful 2&1 victory against the Spanish pair of Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ballers, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours with a 4&3 ratio after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team managed to come back from a four-point disadvantage in individual tournaments, although Furyk's defending team has a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being the second best, a Sunday counterattack seems unrealistic.
"No way" North Korea will unilaterally come down on you if you don't trust your negotiating partner.
North Korea's Foreign Minister has announced to the UN on Saturday that maintaining sanctions has only increased mistrust of the United States of America, and there is no way that under these circumstances the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear armament.
Ri Jongho said at the annual General Assembly of the World Organisation that North Korea has taken "significant and generous steps" over the last year, such as shutting down nuclear and missile experiments, shutting down nuclear experiments and promising not to expand its nuclear arsenal and the scope of nuclear technology.
“Unfortunately, however, we do not see similar responses from the Americans, ” he said.
– In the absence of confidence in America, we feel that the security of our nation is not guaranteed, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be one-sided and first discharged."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's disappointment about Washington's resistance to the idea of "phase" nuclear disarmament, which is a scenario in which North Korea would receive rewards for the steps taken until then, her statement seemed significant because she did not clearly reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done so far.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jongun and Donald Trump at the very first summit ever held between a powerful US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, during which Kim promised to work on “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump guaranteed North Korea's integrity.
North Korea is trying to make an official point at the end of the war in Korea in 1950-53, but the United States of America believes that Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has not given in to strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“America insists that we start with nuclear disarmament and increase the pressure by sanctions to force its will upon us, and it also protests against the declaration of the end of the war,” said Ri.
– The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a fantasy of people who don't know us.
The problem is, non-relief sanctions only increase our suspicions."
Ri did not mention that a second summit was planned between Kim and Trump, which, however, was specifically discussed by the US President in the UN at the beginning of the week.
Rather, the Minister pointed out that three meetings took place between Kim and South Korean President Munjein in the last five months and added: “If the nuclear disarmament country were South Korea, not the United States of America, nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stalemate.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from that of last year when she told the UN General Assembly that targeting the North American continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump, the "evil president", called Kim "the rocket man", who was on a suicide mission.
This year, in the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea with "total destruction" last year, praised Kim for having the courage to take steps towards disarmament, but also noted that there was still much work to be done and that sanctions would remain until North Korea implemented nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday Trump said that no time limit was imposed, that is, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council could reward Pyongyang for the steps taken so far.
On the other hand, US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said in the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council have to be observed unwaveringly until we have achieved the actual, final, demonstrable nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously maintained sanctions against North Korea in order to discourage the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Rí during the UN General Assembly's break, and then said that he was going to visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go so well.
After leaving Pyongyang in July, he announced that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands" hours later.
In the context of the meeting with Mun this month, North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear facility if the United States takes "the right steps."
According to Mun, the "good steps" mentioned by Kim would be security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps that could lead to the normalisation of his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are trained to rest long enough.
This year, a new class at Harvard University encouraged students to sleep more and more, fighting against the growing macho culture of caffeine-heated all-night learning.
One academic came to the conclusion that students from the world’s number one university are often completely lost when it comes to how they should care for themselves.
The course, which he believes is the first such training in the United States, was designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, who teaches sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and practices as a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
He was encouraged to develop the course by giving a lecture earlier on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came up to me and asked, ‘Why am I facing this only now as a senior?’
He said that no one ever told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me," he said to Telegraph.
During the course launched for the first time this year, students will be told how the right sleep patterns have a fundamental impact on their educational and sports performance, apart from having a positive impact on their general well-being.
According to Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and director of medical services at the university, the university decided to start the course because during the week the students were found to be extremely unsleepy.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of them, for example, they show a picture of a dorm room where students can click on coffee counters, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is influenced by sleeplessness, and why the sleeping routine is important.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area with interactive icons is presented to encourage participants to think about the daily routine.
“We know that we will not immediately change student behavior.
But we believe that they have the right to this knowledge – just as they have the right to be aware of the health effects of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
A culture in which learning through a night is still flourishing, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students will lead to increasing problems of sleeplessness.
Sufficient and quality sleep is the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even protects them from obesity, as sleep deprivation forces the brain into starving mode and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemistry and biophysics, and last year at Harvard, she took one of the professor's first courses.
He said that the people who heard him opened his eyes and encouraged him to sword up for a university-level education.
It hopes that as a next step, postgraduate students will be able to participate in a similar training programme before they can enter the competitive sphere.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set a warning to go to bed, a wake-up call, and familiarize themselves with the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electric screens and LED light sources, which can easily dissuade them from the daily rhythm and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston – Rangers 1-0: Menga defeats Gerrard's men and scores a goal
The Rangers suffered another alien defeat when Dolly Menga's bomb broke up Steven Gerrard's team into a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The ibroxys tried to win their first foreign victory after the 4-1 victory in St. Johnstone in February, but Gerrard suffered his second defeat from Gary Holt's team in his 18 games as manager. Thus, they are eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership (the Scottish Championship)'s first runner-up, Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the half, and the Rangers' unmotivated team didn't even get close to equalizing.
While the Rangers went down to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third, just because of the score difference, missing the Hibernian.
In addition, Rangers may face additional difficulties after the head injury of the coast marker Calum Spence caused medical attention due to an object likely thrown off the guest stands.
Gerrard also changed eight points on the team that took the Ayr to the finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, entered the field with the same 11 men who took one point from Hearts last week, and he would certainly have been happy to watch his perfected team drown his opponent's game wherever he was.
Even though the Rangers were leading the ball, Livingston was better off with what it had.
You could have scored a goal in the first two minutes when you first gave Menga to Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate, but the midfielder failed to sell the ziccer.
Keaghan Jacobs' low free kick landed at Team Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow only hit the side of the gate.
The Rangers took control, but there was more hope in their game in the last third than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt that he deserved to be punished at the fifteenth minute when he collided with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed his Colombian complaints.
The Rangers had only two first-term gates to fire, but the weak shot by former Ibroxi goalkeeper Liam Kelly by the head of Slowly Coulibaly and Ovie Ejaria was hardly a problem.
Even though Livi's attempt at 34 minutes went against the game, no one can deny that they deserved the chance, even for their hard work.
The Rangers have once again missed a prank that Jacobs has forced.
Scott Arfield didn't respond in time when Declan Gallagher pushed the ball into Scott Robinson, who found Menga for the easy ending.
Gerrard decided during the break, he replaced Coulibally with Ryan Kent, and it had an effect on the game almost immediately when he was teasing the extreme Morelos, but Kelly, the amazing one, blocked in time.
Livingston continued to make him play just the game he liked, and Lithgow and Halkett swept up the long balls one by one.
Holt's team could have taken a bigger advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor took the net well and took Jacobs' position before Lithgow blew a nail.
Glenn Middleton, in exchange for the Rangers, tried to fight another eleven when he got in a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson couldn't be convinced.
Almanach: The inventor of the Geiger counter
A detail of our "Sunday Breakfast" almanach: September 30, 1882, now exactly 136 years ago... is the day when the later physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that could have created the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become one of the basic tools of science, and thanks to the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, the strange cowboy scholars of 1950:
Man: “What on earth is this?
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. You can earn radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on this headphones, you can hear the sound of atoms emitted by the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: "Listen to me, she's really bouncing."
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, he lives on in his invention bearing his name.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” abnormal cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and kill abnormal cells
A vaccine given as part of a treatment will teach the immune system to recognise abnormal cells.
Part of the method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and then modify them in a lab.
This allows them to “see” the protein that accompanies many kinds of cancers, injecting the treated immune cells back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine has yielded promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was being treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to detect abnormal cells could say goodbye to ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
It is part of the method of extracting immune cells from the patient; it is modified in the laboratory to “see” a protein called HER2, which is a common accompaniment of multiple cancers; and then replanting the cells.
Jay Berzofsky, professor of the American National Cancer Research Institute (Bethesda, Maryland), said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine in our possession.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers,” explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method, based on highlighting immune cells and ‘teaching’ them how to attack cancer cells, has previously been successfully used to treat a type of leukaemia.
The role of Kanye West SNL wearing the MAGA cap peaked in a abusive tirad supporting Trump.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was whistled at Saturday Night Live after an incoherent expression in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would apply for president in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in Make America's Great Again cap, he began to speak up against the Democrats and again emphasized his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to someone who is white, he asks: ‘How can you like Trump because he is racist?’
If you were interested in racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL's show was opened by Matt Damon with a parody in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh made fun of his testimony to the Senate Justice Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment charges.
Although it wasn't on the air, the video of West's speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading it.
West even complained to the audience that he was being picked on behind the scenes about his hat.
“I was intimidated behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out in that hat."
I was intimidated!
And they said that I was in the sunken place," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Do you want to see a sunken place? I put on my Superman robe because it means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His manifestations were accompanied by a whistle from the audience at least twice, and SNL characters were apparently embarrassed by one of the eyewitnesses who said to Variety: "The whole studio was silently silent."
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose former friend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West raised more questions when he performed his song I Love it dressed as Perrier glass.
West was supported by the conservative TPUSA group leader, Candace Turner, in a tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR COMING WITH THE MUSIC."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West was simply "she was herself, and that's great."
“But I have decided not to reward someone (with the purchase of his music or fashion items or with the support of his “art”), whom I believe to own and distribute an ideology that is harmful to the community I belong to.
He's free.
But so do we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, now he is "the creature formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddy.
His rapper companion Snoop Dogg also took the name Snoop Lion, and of course the late legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
They're accusing the Belfast restaurant knifer of attempted murder.
A 45 - year - old man is accused of attempted murder after being stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
According to a police statement, it happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to stand before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the D.A.'s office.
Kit Harington, the star of Game of Thrones, finds excessive manhood harmful
Kit Harington is mostly known as the Jon Snow of Game of Thrones, and in HBO's violent fantasy series, set in the Middle Ages, he often takes a sword himself.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out against the stereotypical macho heroes, pointing out that in view of such heroes, little boys often feel that hard action is needed to fight respect.
Kit, in his statement to The Sunday Times Culture, said that "something went wrong" and raised the question of how to deal with the harmful effects of excessive masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The star who recently married her 31-year-old serial colleague Rose Leslie said that she thought it was very important to remedy the problem.
“I am personally deeply affected by this matter, ” the actor asked, “how did the representation of manhood become so distorted.
– What have we taught men as children about the problem we face now?"
Kit believes that television is also responsible for the spread of the distorted image of masculinity, since the shows often feature very mascarin characters.
Continuing the thought, he added: “What is it that is born with us, and what is it that we are learning?
What does the street and the TV say to the young boys that makes them feel like it's the only way to be a man?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time – and how we can change that.
Because clearly there's something wrong with young men."
Kit stated in the interview that after the summer season of the series, he would not be included in the Game of Thrones history series or sequels because he “has had enough of battlefields and horses”.
As of November, Kit will play a leading role in the recycling of Sam Shepard’s True West, a film about a producer and his brother who is a robber.
The actor told me that the best thing he got from Game of Thrones was his wife Rose, who he met while he was making the show.
"I met my wife on the set, so I owe my future family and my life to the show," said Kit.
She played Rose Ygritte, who was the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's Scottish family estate.
HIV/AIDS: New patients in China increased by 14%
China has announced that the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14% in the country.
Health officials have said that this means more than 820 000 people involved.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, the number of reported cases increased by around 40,000.
Compared to previous cases, a significant majority of newly infected people are sexually infected.
The disease spread rapidly through the transfusion of infected blood in some parts of China.
However, health officials at a conference in the province of Junnan stated that the number of such cases has since decreased to nearly zero.
Nevertheless, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 compared to the previous year.
The sexual transfer of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against the community has been very strong ever since.
According to estimates in various studies, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men eventually marry women because of their conservative values.
In many cases the disease spreads in these relationships due to inappropriate sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has provided universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of the problem-solving programme.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her crew members leaked Republican senators' data and condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. congresswoman Maxine Waters turned down allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Senators' Wikipedia page.
According to the democratic representative of Los Angeles, these allegations were distributed by "extreme right-wing" experts and websites.
“Lie, lie, and more vile lies,” wrote Waters on Twitter.
The information reportedly contained the address and telephone number of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as well as Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday. The publisher is unknown, but it is certain that they were released from the Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh regarding sexual harassment.
The leak happened shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
According to conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the source-identified IP address is linked to Waters' office, and data on a member of Waters' staff has been reported, says The Hill.
“These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars, ” continued Waters.
– My staff member is not responsible for leaking information. However, his right to anonymity, protection of his personal data and security has been violated as a result of fraudulent and lying accusations.
These accusations are completely unfounded, false, and obviously liars."
Mr. Waters' statements were quickly criticised on the Internet, and among the critics were Ari Fleischer, former press secretary of the White House.
“It’s an angry denial, ” wrote Fleischer.
– From this point of view, Waters does not seem to have the temperament necessary for his position as a representative.
If someone's being accused of something they didn't do, they can't react angryly.
You can't be defiant.
You can't question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and calm."
Mr. Waters' reaction was apparently compared to Judge Kavanaugh's reaction to Democratic criticism, who, according to some critics, seemed too angry at the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for Waters in the mid-term elections, also shared his views on Twitter.
“ If it’s true, it’s serious,” he wrote in his message.
Mr. Waters wrote in his statement that his office had notified the "right authorities and law enforcement" about the false accusations.
"We are concerned that the perpetrators are known," he continued, Waters, "and that they are legally held liable for all acts that threaten or harm any member of my staff."
Johnny English strikes again, or Rowan Atkinson's sneaky spy comedy
It has become a tradition for us to look for references to Brexit in all British-related films, and there can be no exception for the Johnny English action comedy/parody franchise, the first part of which, Johnny English was reloaded in 2003, and the second part of Johnny English was reloaded in 2011.
Will the new export product of the British nation become the sarcastic, self-evident satires, in which we indulge in our own obvious lameness?
What is certain is that the trash-sucking, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had enough ammunition for another return – it is clear from his name that this comic character was created so that the crowds of viewers in cinemas in non-English-speaking countries of the world could laugh at it.
Johnny English, of course, is a crazed secret agent who, with his bizarre manners, thinks he's attractive, reminds me of Inspector Clouseau, sometimes Mr. Bean, and occasionally the guy who contributed to the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics by pressing a single key.
The character was originally based on the mysterious international traveler that Atkinson once played in a long-forgotten Barclaycard commercial, who left chaos everywhere.
There are a few good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I loved the way Johnny English dressed in medieval armor approached a helicopter, and when he got there, the rotors knocked on his helmet for a few moments.
Atkinson's comical vein prevails well in the film, but the humor of the film does not really work, and it even seems unnecessary, because nowadays, franchises such as James Bond films and the Mission Impossible series have the courage to touch the instrument of humor.
It feels like the humor of the film is aimed at the children, and to me, Johnny English's wacky, failed adventures do not reach the level of ingenuity and genius that Atkinson brings in the silent scenes of the Mr. Bean series.
The starting point of the film is eternal: Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal broke into the British spy network's top-secret online network and revealed the identity of all British agents to the greatest terror of the agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately only got such a small role in the film.
This may be the last nail in the coffin of the conceited and divisive Prime Minister, whose political popularity is in ruins: Emma Thompson is practically playing Theresa May and bringing everything out of the otherwise poorly written character.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since all active agents have been identified, he has to put a retired agent on the job.
This retired agent is, of course, the clumsy Johnny English, who has been working as a teacher in a high school since his retirement, but by way of the curriculum he teaches children to spy – there are funny scenes here, of course, while he explains the basics of spying in English's kind of "Rocksuli".
English will be transported quickly to Whitehall, where, during the emergency briefing, he will meet his former, long-suffering gun carrier, Bough, who is currently being played by Ben Miller.
Bough has been married since then, and married the captain of a submarine whose mouth is always up to his ears – the captain is played by Vicki Pepperdine, who is destined for much better roles.
Thus, the clumsy "Batman and Robin" of His Majesty's national security service is back in action and confronts Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by the beautiful Olga Kurylenko as a woman of true destiny.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is increasingly ensnared by the charismatic IT billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's digital problems: his name is Jason Volta, and Jake Lacy is playing it.
English and Bough begin their clown mission: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, then smuggled themselves into Volta's luxury yacht in an incredible mess, and English actually unleashes hell when he tries to get to know Volta's apartment using a VR-headset.
These stations are needed to reach the end, but however cheerful and turnful it has been, it may give the impression of a children's film a little too much.
The result is rather mediocre.
As with the other Johnny English films, I've been wondering: can't the British film industry finally give Rowan Atkinson a talent?
The British Labour Party denies introducing a four-day working week while paying the British five-day working wages
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is working on a radical plan: the introduction of a four-day working week, all with employees working for five days' wages.
The party is said to want workers to benefit from the revolution of artificial intelligence (MI) so that, thanks to increased income, the CEOs would give workers an extra day off.
According to the draft, employees would get a three-day weekend, while taking home the same amount as before.
According to the sources, the idea would be "fit" in the party's economic programme, which aims to tip the balance of the balances on the side of the workers in the country.
The four-day working week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour official said to the Sunday Times: “The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
Although it will not happen overnight, the four-day working week is an idea that fits well into the party's program of tipping the balance sheet to the workers in the economy and fits the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party campaigned with the promise of a four-day working week in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
However, the idea does not enjoy the support of the Labour Party as a whole.
The spokesperson of the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not a policy supported by the Party and the issue is not even on the agenda."
Last week's Labour Conference, shadow finance minister John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution affecting the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the "faceless directors" and the "beneficiaries" of the overhead companies.
If the plans of the shadow finance minister were to be implemented, the shareholders of the water service companies would not get their full profits back, because a Labour Government would make "deductions" as punishment for the perceived harmful activities.
McDonnell further confirmed that he plans to make workers a member of the board of directors and establish Inclusive Ownership Funds, which would transfer 10% of the shares of private sector companies to employees, which could generate 500 important dividends per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" told us if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
As a result of the FBI investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, at least a week later than the original date, the final vote on Kavanaugh's election as supreme judge will be held.
In his "60 Minutes" Sunday interview, journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed less committed than his colleague in South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
- That's what I said before the hearing, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the case broke out, after the charges were filed, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be concrete.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and I would need extremely serious accusations to change my mind, ” Graham said.
“ Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know that Brett strongly denied the allegations, ” said Graham, addressed to Christine Blasey Ford.
- And none of the people named by Dr. Ford confirmed the charges.
It's a 36-year-old story.
I don't think anything new will come out."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, the annual music event Global Citizen Festival begins in New York City. World stars will perform at the festival to stand up for a truly noble goal: the global eradication of poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival will be held for the seventh time, and it is expected that tens of thousands of people will spend the Great lawn of Central Park, where participants will not only be able to enjoy the presentation of Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but can also draw attention to the real purpose of the event: the elimination of deep poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was first held in 2012 as part of the Global Poverty Project. The project is run by an international stakeholder group aimed at eradicating poverty by involving more and more people in the active fight against poverty.
Free tickets (unless they refuse to pay for VIP tickets) can be awarded to those who undertake to perform certain tasks or “acts”, such as volunteering, sending emails to a leading politician, a phone call, or any other meaningful activity to draw attention to the goal of the project: eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen actually been in achieving the goals set in the last 12 years?
Is it really an effective tool to reward people with concert tickets to convince others of the importance of action, or is this just another form of so-called "clicktivism" when people feel they have contributed to a case by signing an online petition or writing a Twitter message?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen data, more than 19 million "actions" have been carried out by project promoters for many different purposes.
According to the organisation, these actions contributed to the allocation of 37 billion dollars by world leaders to policies and commitments against poverty, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group claimed 390 commitments and announcements that they came from their actions, 10 billion of which were already paid out or collected during fundraising.
The group estimates that the money collected had already had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people.
The main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom, between investors and contractors, which aims to "help children achieve their potential." The organization promised Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate hunger after receiving over 4700 Twitter messages from "global citizens".
"With the support of the UK Government and donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can banish social injustices and malnutrition among the footnotes in the history books," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also claims that, after more than 5,000 actions were requested by the United Kingdom to improve the food supply of mothers and their children, the government allocated resources to the Power of Nutrition project, which will improve the food supply of 5 million women and children.
One of the frequently asked questions published on the Global Citizen’s website is: “Why do you think deep poverty can be eradicated?"
According to the Global Citizen’s reply: “It will be a long and difficult journey, in which we sometimes get stuck and sometimes fail.
But like the former civil rights and anti-segregation movements, we also achieve our goal, because together we are stronger."
Among other things, Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be performing at this year's New York event, and the hosts will be Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
Home Minister: U.S. Navy "block" to hinder Russian energy exports
"If necessary", D.C. would even use the Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from entering the market, such as Russian energy in the Middle East, quoted US Minister Ryan Zinke, Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's active presence in Syria, in particular as regards Russian operations at the request of the legitimate Syrian government, is merely an excuse for Russia to acquire new energy markets.
“I think they are only there in the Middle East because they want to sell energy there, as they do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe,” Zinke said in a statement.
And according to the Home Secretary, there are ways to stop the Russians.
“The United States of America, with its navy, can ensure that maritime routes are open and can block them if necessary, so that it can ensure that Russian energy does not enter the markets,” Zinke said.
Zinke addressed his words to participants in a non-profit group called Consumer Energy Alliance – otherwise the non-profit group defines itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
In his speech, he compared Washington’s action against Russia and Iran and noted that they were practically the same methods.
"Iran and Russia can be sanctioned economically in the same way: using existing energy sources and introducing new ones," Zinke said, while calling Russia a "one-dimensional economy", pointing out the country's dependence on fossil fuels.
The statements coincide with the Trump Government's plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus displacing Russia from the market, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
Therefore, leading officials of the Trump government, including the President himself, are convincing Germany to back out from behind the "incorrect" pipeline project called Nord Stream 2, which, if implemented, will make Germany a "hostage".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that doubles the existing capacity, thus increasing it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
According to the Kremlin, Washington is so strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons, which is an expression of unfair competition.
"I assume that we are in the same position that energy should not be used for pressure and that consumers should be given the opportunity to freely choose their suppliers," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attempt to convince the Americans backfired because Germany confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Association (BDI), called on the USA not to interfere in EU energy policy, as well as to stay away from bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it problematic when a third state intervenes in our energy affairs," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after Angela Merkel and Vladimir Putin's last meeting.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts "really considering" to run for president in 2020
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that after the mid-term elections, "he will seriously consider it" to run for president.
Warren in Massachusetts, at a town meeting in Holyoke, confirmed that he was considering leaving.
“It’s time for women to get into Washington and put a bad government in place, and it’s time for a woman to become president, ” said Warren, according to The Hill.
– After 6 November, I will seriously consider running for president."
At the town meeting, Warren criticized Donald Trump and said that he thought he was taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I have a serious concern about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," Warren said.
Warren literally criticized Trump and Brett Kavanaugh as supreme court candidates.
In a Friday Twitter message Warren wrote, "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, on the basis of a survey published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters in Massachusetts do not think that Warren should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolki University Political Analysis Centre and Boston Globe, 58% of the voters in Massachusetts who voted "good chance" for Warren said that the senator should not run for president, while
32% of them support Warren's presidential nomination.
According to the survey, the majority, 38% of the respondents, and 48% of the respondents, would oppose the presidential nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick.
In connection with the presidential elections in 2020, the names of high-ranking democratic politicians such as former vice president Joe Biden and senator Bernie Sanders in Vermont were also raised.
According to the Associated Press report, Biden will decide whether to run until January.
Sarah Palin referred to Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting
26-year-old Track Palin served in Iraq for a year after applying in September
On Monday night, he was arrested for domestic violence.
“What my son has been going through since he returned home, I understand the other families who experience the terrible consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are going home with," said Sarah Palin at Donald Trump's meeting in Oklahoma.
Palin’s son’s arrest was called “the elephant in the room” and he said that his son, like other war veterans, “came back changed, hardened, and constantly wondered whether due respect had been given to the service their comrades, pilots, and all the other members of the army for the country.”
Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on the charge of domestic violence against a woman. Dan Bennett, spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Department, said that Track Palin, in addition, reportedly committed domestic violence with a gun, drunk.
18 Member States and Washington DC support judicial review of asylum policy
18 Member States and Washington D.C. support a judicial review of the new US asylum policy to ensure that those who flee gang or domestic violence cannot be sheltered.
Representatives from 18 different Member States, as well as Washington DC, wrote an expert letter on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who attacks politics in court, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the Grace vs. Sessions case initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
According to the plaintiff, her partner and “sons of a violent crime gang” assaulted her, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She's in custody in Texas.
Prosecutors of the states that supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as places where many asylum applications to the United States come from, where violence by criminal gangs and domestic violence is a continuing problem in these countries.
The new U.S. asylum policy withdrew a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (BIA), which allowed immigrants without documents to apply for asylum in order to escape domestic violence.
Karl Racine, Washington, D.C.'s Attorney General, stated in a Friday statement that the new policy "passes over decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Under federal law, all asylum applications must be assessed in the light of the facts and circumstances in which they are concerned, and such an obstacle violates this principle’, states the expert letter.
The prosecutors also explained in the letter that immigration policy is harmful to the American economy, as immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "fill in the lowest level of jobs."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed asylum judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and criminal gangs.
"Immunity is due to a person who leaves his country due to racial, religious, national origin, membership of a specific social group or a well-founded fear of political conviction or persecution," said Sessions at the time of the announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum is not designed to solve all people's problems worldwide, no matter how serious they may be.
Desperate rescue in Palu, dead numbers doubled, rescue teams racing against time
Survivors are getting worse and worse.
“Everyone is very tense, ” says Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, calming her feverish son in an evacuation center in Palu, a disaster - stricken son.
- Ambulance's bringing the bodies in every minute.
We barely have any drinking water."
Some of the residents returned to their homes destroyed to save what was still salvaged from the wet stuff.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals that have also been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake cannot be treated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken spine and shoulder, were taken to the Palui Military Hospital, and the patients were treated outside the hospital building because of the large aftershocks.
The man’s eyes filled with tears as he recalled that the fifth floor hotel room, in which he and his wife and daughter were staying, shook into the devastating quake.
“There was no time to escape.
I think I was trapped in the fallen walls, said Haris to the Associated Press, and then added that his family had come to town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of using propaganda ads to annoy the country.
The Chinese ambassador of the United States accused Beijing of spreading propaganda in the US press, which was a week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper that emphasized the mutual benefits of American-Chinese trade relations.
US President Donald Trump referred to his advertisement published last Wednesday in the China Daily Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest edition newspaper, while accusing China of trying to intervene in the US congressional elections on 6 November. China denies the charge.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the US elections is a new phase in Washington's ever stronger action against China, according to some US officials who declare to Reuters, with the aim of putting China under pressure.
Although it is not unusual for foreign governments to promote trade in their country through advertising, there is an increasing commercial war between Beijing and Washington, which imposes additional duties on each other's imported products.
According to US and Chinese experts, the Chinese customs duties imposed in response at the beginning of the trade war sought to target exporters from countries where Trump and the Republican Party are popular, including Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the Chinese ambassador of the United States and former governor of Iowa for several cycles, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and shops, because the State of Iowa is exporting significant quantities of agricultural products to China.
Branstad wrote in an opinion article published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that "China is still harassing our country by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the cherished American tradition of freedom of expression and press by spreading propaganda in paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
– However, if we go to a newspaper vendor in Beijing, we can hardly find critical articles. The Chinese press does not faithfully reflect the different views of the Chinese people on the increasingly gloomy growth prospects of the Chinese economy, as the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party."
Branstad added that “One of China’s most famous newspapers refused to publish” his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts say Republicans can alienate female voters with the Kavanaugh scandal before the midterm elections.
Analysts say that many high-ranking Republican politicians defend Brett Kavanaugh as a supreme court candidate in the crossfire of sexual harassment charges, in particular, losing support for female voters before the midterm elections.
The incident triggered intense emotions, and most Republicans publicly stated that they would continue to vote for Kavanaugh.
These statements cannot be taken back, says Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse in a Saturday article in The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute FBI investigation proposed by Republican Senator Jeff Flake in Arizona would be sufficient to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – neither tomorrow nor November," said a newspaper from Washington, D.C. said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national spokesman of the progressive group MoveOn on Friday.
According to Mic, on Friday morning some protesters in the Senate corridor chanted, "November is approaching!" because despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Justice Committee under Republican control, decided not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will jump to an amazing extent," said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
“Many say that it was already very high, and that is true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women's insecure voters in the suburbs and young people (18-29 years) who, although not enthusiastic about the president, often do not vote."
Analysts had already assumed before Ford's public testimony that he could fight back with the Republicans if they continued to stand up for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination.
“At the beginning of last week, according to NBC News, Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Committee, “the Republican Party has fallen to a solid ground.”
"This is not just about the committee vote and the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be appointed, but also about the way the Republicans handled the case and how they acted with Ford," said Guy Cecil, director of the United States of America of Priorities, who helped elect Democrats.
It seems, however, that the Americans are fairly divided in whether Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony is true, and Kavanaugh is believed by a little more than Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believed Ford's testimony entirely or more, and at Kavanaugh, 35% of respondents gave the same answer.
Furthermore, 38% of respondents believe that Kavanaugh probably or surely lied about his testimony, while only 30% of the respondents believed that about Ford.
Flake's motion has led the FBI to investigate the authenticity of Ford's allegations, as did another of Kavanaugh's accusers, Deborah Ramirez, as described by the Guardian.
Ford swore to the Senate Justice Committee a week ago that Kavanaugh was drunk and harassed him when he was 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitalia at a party in the 1980s when they both studied at Yale.
The inventor of the web would launch a new Internet to confront Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where they want to store their data and who can access the information.
In his exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was to “take control of the world”.
“We have to do it now, ” he said about the startup.
– It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal online repository", also known as POD.
This may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, musical directories, as well as other personal and professional tools.
This is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify from the same browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online repository is that the user can decide who has access to your data in its entirety.
The company calls this "the realization of the right of individuals to self-determination over data".
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company is responsible for providing resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contractor developers involved in the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, world technology developers will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not ask “Facebook and Google whether to introduce full change technology that would completely turn business models of companies upside down overnight.”
"We don't ask permission from them."
Berners-Lee wrote in the entry published on the Medium on Saturday that Inrupt “is sent to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the newly built Solidra network.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical University.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an important opinionformer in the debates surrounding the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, despite the launch of Inrupt.
"I am endlessly optimistic about the next era of the World Wide Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann Victoria - Crossed First World War minister celebrated
The only Anglican minister to receive the Victoria Cross is celebrated by his hometown 100 years after his heroic act in World War I.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel earned the medal during the attacks on Belnglise and Lehacourt on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, a sniper killed him, so he could never know that he deserved the highest honor of the British armed forces.
The Memorial Stone in his honor was discovered by two grandchildren at the Saturday celebration in Rushden, Northamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “symbolically important” that the monument was handed over exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s decorated act.
According to the London Gazette, Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin channel on 29 September 1918 "in the midst of thick fog and heavy gunfire and machine gunfire".
Later, he hurried to the front line and “exceptional heroism” led the battalion, and then attacked a camp-gun task force alone, destroying three of its members.
Reverend Bernard Vann and Lieutenant Colonel were shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
"I know I can never measure up to what my grandfather did, and it taught me humility," said Michael Vann, 72-year-old grandfather.
After the march led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Michael Vann and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also crowned the Memorial Stone.
Michael Vann said that he felt honored to play a part in the ceremony and added: “The valiantness of a true hero is demonstrated by the number of people who later express their respect to him.”
The MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 broadcasts, instead they got Peppa's pig.
Imagine that you've been on the lookout all night to watch the exciting Bellator 206, and the broadcast is cancelled.
The San Jose show featured 13 clashes, six of which were broadcast live at night on Channel 5 in the UK as part of the main event.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to fight each other, to the great surprise of the viewers in England, Peppa was put on the show instead of the game.
A lot of people resented that, because of this clash, they stayed up until the early hours of the morning.
Instead of playing the MMA game, one of the fans called the children's drawing film "some kind of sick joke" on Twitter.
“According to state regulation, this kind of content can no longer be broadcast by the network at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwartz, chief vice president of Bellator’s communication and marketing department.
- Yes, it's Peppa, the pig's time."
Scott Coker, president of the Bellator Corporation, promised that in the future, the schedule of the show would be revised to include the UK viewers.
“I think that we can resolve the matter by repeating it, ” said Coker.
– However, since it is 6 a.m. on Sunday, until Sunday, which is Monday, we cannot remedy the situation.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the show turned over, there were a lot of messages, and most of them weren't exactly friendly.
At first we thought we were dealing with a technical problem, so we tried to fix it.
But it wasn't that, it was a legal problem.
However, I can promise you that something like this will not happen next time.
There will be only five matches in the program instead of the six so far – we wanted to please the viewers very much, but we miscalculated.
It was an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley struggled with a minority complex because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley said that he felt inferior to anyone in his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that he was motivated to succeed.
According to the 24-year-old athlete, until high school, he did not notice that “not everyone is like him”.
In Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said that she stood up for gay rights to give hope to others.
He added that since he became a parent, he's been much less interested in the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-lived show, Kirsty Young, missed several months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley invited me as a shipwreck, saying that as a young man, he felt "less" than anyone else, because "socially it was not acceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, it is the feeling of inferiority and differentness that I draw endurance and strength to achieve my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was worth something, too, so that he would not disappoint everyone when his sexual orientation was revealed.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known representative of the LGBT community and, taking advantage of his participation in this year's international community games in Australia, has asked the world's governments to decriminalize homosexuality in as many countries as possible.
He said that he spoke because he felt lucky to live his life openly, without negative consequences, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that "she was completely surprised" when she fell in love with another man, Dustin Lance Black, an American filmmaker she met for the first time in 2013.
Daley and the Oscar-winning screenwriter 20 years older than him got married last year, and he claims that the age difference between them was never a problem.
“If you go through so much when you are young,” he said, “you were 14 when you were in your first Olympics, and your father died three years later from cancer, then you find it difficult to find someone of your own age who has experienced similar extreme experiences.
The couple adopted a little boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June.
“If I had been asked this question last year, I would have said that the most important thing was to win a gold medal, ” he said.
There are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The child’s name was Robert after Daley’s father, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
According to Daley's statement, his father refused to accept that he was going to die, and one of his last questions was whether he had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I was unable to answer him, ‘Father, you will no longer be in the front row,’ he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, but until that moment I could not accept that my father was not invulnerable,” he said.
The following year Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I felt that this is what I had dreamed of my whole life: jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better,” he said.
The song Heather Small Proud (Proud) helped her a lot during her Olympic preparation, and she still gets goose bumps when she hears it.
Desert Island Discs starts Sunday at 11:15 local time on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson was out of shape, and he got benched on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Mickelson can set a record by taking part in his 47th Cup game on Sunday, but he must regain his form if he does not want this milestone to remain an unpleasant experience in his memory.
Mickelson has played for the 12th time at the biennial event, but due to his performance at the four-ball and four-game matches on Saturday, team captain Jim Furyk put him on the bench.
Instead of being the center of events for five winners in the big tournaments, as often as it is when the United States had to fight for victory, he now cheers for his team in one half of the day, spends the other half practicing on the field, trying to correct the mistakes that weaken his game.
He was never one of the most accurate clubs at the top of his career, so the 48-year-old player does not really have the narrow track of Le Golf National, where high grass costs a very high price to pay for faulty punches.
And if the track alone isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face the exacting English champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who won all four games this week on the starting team with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans with a four-point disadvantage start hard before the 12 individual matches, then Mickelson's match may be crucial.
Furyk says he trusts the player, but what else can he say?
“He is fully aware of his role in the evolution of today. He patted me on the back, put his arms around me and promised to be ready for tomorrow,” said Furyk.
- He's very confident.
He's one of the biggest, and he's done a lot for the team in the past and over the past week.
Basically, I didn't want him to have two games.
I've planned more, but in this situation, we've decided it's the best option.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
With Mickelson's Sunday performance, he's gonna break Nick Faldo's record, and no one's ever played more games in the Ryder Cup.
By doing so, you can close a series on the Ryder Cup that is far below the player's individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven drawes, but Furyk pointed out that the veteran’s presence has no tangible advantages for the team.
“Funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to joke around with others, he is a great team member, ” he explained.
– I think younger players also enjoyed playing against him, and this is good to see.
Your presence goes beyond playing in a strict sense."
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, is aware that they can easily lose their advantage.
Thomas Bjørn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that even if someone gets a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup, luck can easily turn its back on him.
The Danish player first performed in a 1997 game in Valderram, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros won a five-point advantage against the Americans, and at the end they barely managed to keep a hairline advantage for the 141⁄2–131⁄2 victory.
“We always have to remind ourselves that even though we gained a great advantage in Valderrama, we won only by a hair, and we also had a great advantage in Brookline, where we finally lost," said Bjørn after the 5–3 victory of the 2018 class on Friday and yesterday, which led to 10–6 in Le Golf National.
– It is enough to think about the competitions of previous years, and already everyone can see that the game is not over.
Tomorrow, you'll have to play with full force.
So go ahead and do whatever it takes to win.
We can't relax until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win this trophy, and that is all we need to focus on right now.
As I said before, I mostly deal with the 12 players of our team, but we also have to pay attention to the other side, who happens to be one of the world's greatest players."
Proud of the team’s hard track performance, Bjørn added: “I would never make predictions in this situation.
Tomorrow's a whole different story.
Then it's all about individual performances, which is completely different from team play.
It's great to play in pairs when things are going well, but when you stand up individually, it turns out in every way what kind of golfer you really are.
That's what you have to tell the players to get the best of themselves on the field tomorrow.
They need to get away from their partner, who will also have to do his best."
Unlike Bjørn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opponent's team, is confident that his players will perform better individually than in pairs, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk personally experienced both sides of the last-day resurrections: he was a member of the winning team in Brookline, and then he was on the losing side of the brilliant performance of the European team, referred to as the Medinah miracle.
“I remember every damn word, ” he replied when he was asked how he encouraged the players before the last day, team captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
– We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we're best off with a quick start, as we saw in Brookline, as we saw in Medina.
If one team really gets into it, it puts the opponent's players under a lot of pressure during the middle games.
Accordingly, we have assembled the order and prepared our players so that tomorrow they can perform a real miracle."
Thomas was given the task of taking the lead in the efforts to turn the position, and he is playing against Rory McIlroy in the first game, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the first half of the European team.
"I chose the order because I think that this is the way the picture comes together from beginning to end," Bjørn added to the individual setup.
The transfer of Germany's latest warship has been postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War war war warships, but due to various system failures and exponentially increasing costs, this will wait at least until next year.
The inauguration of the brand-new Baden-Württemberg class fregattok flagship "Rheinland-Pfalz" was postponed to the first half of 2019, wrote the weekly Die Zeit, quoting an army spokesperson.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ongoing delays made it very difficult for the large project to take place.
In 2007, the Navy ordered the four Baden-Württemberg class ships to replace the Bremen class aging frigates.
We understand that it will be equipped with high-fire cannons and various anti-aircraft missiles and cloaking technology, including signal dampers that reduce the ship's radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Another important feature is that it needs less maintenance, which in practice means that these latest frigates can be put into service for up to two years away from home ports.
However, due to the ongoing delays in the project, these high-tech warships, which Germany could use to make it feel powerful overseas, may become obsolete as soon as they are finally put into service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 frigate, the heavy fate, was on the cover last year when the German Navy officially refused to inaugurate the vehicle and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to the manufacturer.
There is not much information about the reasons for return, but German media mentions several critical “software and hardware errors”, which render the warship useless in a combat mission.
The lack of software is a major problem, as only 120 sailors will serve on the Baden-Württemberg class of warships, which is only half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It has also been revealed that the ship is extremely overweight, which impairs its performance and makes it impossible for the Navy to make further changes later.
The 7000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar class ships placed by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective parts, the increase in the total cost of the project, including the training of the crew, is a growing problem.
According to some sources, the cost of the project has already reached an amazing EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial plan has calculated EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are of particular importance in light of the fact that Germany's presence at sea is being warned to be reduced.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Chairman of the German Parliament's National Defence Committee, recently admitted that the Navy is "starting to run out of available warships".
According to the civil servant, the problem has become a self-excited process in the meantime, as the old ships had to be decommissioned, but there are no more ships to replace the lost ones.
He was concerned that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
National Trust is looking for a secret life for bats
New research is underway on a Scottish-territorial estate designed to find out how bats exploit landscape features during hunting.
Researchers hope that the results will provide new information on the behaviour of single flying mammals, which could benefit from future species conservation initiatives.
National Trust for Scotland scientists will investigate the behaviour of common and soprano dwarf bats, brown long-eared bats and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
At the appropriate points of the area, special recording devices are installed to record bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will use manual detectors to collect mobile data.
A detailed analysis of the recordings can determine the frequency of bat sounds and what species is doing.
Researchers also provide habitat maps and reports to determine in detail how animal behaviour is shaped according to landscape.
Rob Dewar, the NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal what are the most important habitats for bats and how they are used by which species.
This information helps to determine the beneficial effects of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to preserve forested areas for bats and other affected species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have decreased significantly over the last century.
Construction and land development work disturbs the animals’ sleeping areas and reduces their living space.
Wind turbines and street lighting are a risk factor for them, as are flypapers placed, certain chemical processes used for building materials, and attacks on domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually completely blind.
However, because of their predatory nature at night, they rely much more on their hearing when they hunt prey than on their sight.
They can use sophisticated techniques based on the reflection of ultrasound to determine the exact location of insects and of the terrain in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76 000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
They work with ten qualified professionals who regularly conduct studies and sleep-place examinations and occasionally participate in rescue work.
The organization established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten bat trees in Scotland.
According to estate manager David Thompson, the area is an ideal habitat for bats.
“Here, in Threade, bats have a great place, ” he said.
– There are old buildings, lots of old trees, and everything else needed for a good living space.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, and thanks to work here and in other similar areas, we can learn more about what they need to have a great time."
He also stressed the importance of ensuring that bats live there before the renovation of buildings, as destroying a single colony could result in the destruction of 400 female and young individuals, which could lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals, their destruction, harassment and habitat disturbance are prohibited by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, also asked for the help of the population.
He said: “There is still much that we do not know about bats, and we do not have any information about the situation of the population of most domestic species.”
Ronaldo denies the rape charges, his lawyers are suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "false news". In his opinion, others want to use his name to "get into the public consciousness".
The footballers' lawyers are ready to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel who brought the charges.
The Portuguese member of the framework and the Battle of Juventus were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the woman, the athlete paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
33-year-old Ronaldo told his 142-million-dollar fan base that the news was a lie a few hours after the charges were brought to light.
‘No, no, no, no, no, no.
What was said about me today is all lies," said the five-time gold ball player to the camera.
“They want to use my name to get into the public consciousness.
It happens.
They want to become famous by my name, that's the life of public figures.
I am a happy man, and my life is fine," the player added with a smile.
Because of the allegations called "unacceptable, privacy-infringing suspects", Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel, writes Reuters.
According to lawyer Christian Schertz, the player will submit a claim for compensation "for the moral damage caused to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years."
The incident supposedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the athlete's suite, where he had an anal rape, and it was in the files filed with Clark County District Attorney's office in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good boy”, with the exception of “one percent.”
Based on the information in the documents, Ronaldo admitted that he had sexual relations with the woman, but he believed that all this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and had his injuries seen in a hospital, but later he agreed to an out-of-court settlement because he was “fearing retribution” and “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman wants the agreement to be repealed now, as the trauma caused by this incident continues to make her life miserable.
Ronaldo was about to be converted (from Real Madrid to Manchester United) at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer the Italian giant Juve bought the player for EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom will "forever regret" the loss of car factories
The United Kingdom will "forever regret" if, after Brexit, it loses its leading position as a global car manufacturer, said Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark.
He added that Toyota UK's declaration to the BBC, according to which if the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, would be "an alarming one", the car company would be forced to temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, in the case of an unagreed Brexit, jobs could be lost due to border delays.
Last year, Toyota Auris and Avensis produced 150 000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other Member States of the European Union.
"I see that if the United Kingdom falls out of the EU at the end of March, production stops will take place in the factory," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) expressed concern about the possibility of leaving the EU without agreement on the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW stated that it would close its Oxford plant of Miniket for one month after Brexit.
Car manufacturers are most concerned about the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line is based on "just in time" and parts come in every 37 minutes from suppliers operating in the UK and other EU Member States.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, then cross-border disturbances, according to industry representatives, may lead to delays in production and lack of parts.
According to Toyota, it would be impossible to store more than a day's supply of spare parts in its Derbyshire plant and therefore should stop production.
Clark said that his plan for future relations with the EU, known as Theresa May Chequers, "is precisely designed to avoid late checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want an agreement on the best possible terms, not only to reap the fruits of our current successes, but also to offer new opportunities," said BBC Radio 4 Today.
– Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers can confirm that we absolutely need to maintain our supply chain, which is currently extremely successful."
Toyota could not tell how long production would last, but it warned that the added costs could in the long term impair the competitiveness of the factory, which could ultimately result in job losses.
According to Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years at the plant in Burnaston and is currently representing the Unite union, trade union members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, jobs that have been lost at this time will never be returned.”
One government spokesperson said: "We have developed a precise and feasible plan for future EU relations."
They can postpone Trump and Rosenstein's meeting again, said the White House.
"You may postpone another week" the large-scale meeting of Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump, as the debate around Brett Kavanaugh's supreme court candidate continues, the White House issued a statement on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian influence on the elections, the possible links between Trump's advisers and the Russian government, and the possible obstruction of justice by Trump.
For months in D.C., they've been wondering if Trump will eventually dismiss the Deputy Attorney General, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
According to this month's report from the New York Times, Rosenstein considered coming to the meeting wired to record the conversation with the president, and the question arose as to whether the 25th amendment would allow Trump to be replaced.
Rosenstein denied what was said.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House and rumored that he would submit his resignation.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was present before the United Nations in New York City, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not be happy" to discharge Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflicting with the Senate Justice Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the final Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, visited Fox News' Sunday show.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he replied: “We don’t have a date yet or we can set it for this week, but in the light of the cases in the Supreme Court, I see a possibility of another one-week delay.
We'll find out soon enough, and as always, I'll notify the press."
However, some journalists were skeptical about this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
host Chris Wallace asked me about the reason.
Sanders replied that the rarity of press conferences is not the cause of the television reporters' disapproval of the "sensation-seeking" behaviour, but he added: "I do not dispute the fact that they are sensationalists."
He then pointed out that direct meetings between Trump and press representatives would be more frequent.
"The President gives more questions-and-answers than any former president," he said. He added, even without confirming the statement: "We looked at the numbers."
Press conferences will continue, said Sanders, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, light years are better than talking to me.
We often try to do this, and over the past few weeks we have had a number of such occasions, so instead of press conferences in the White House, you can speak to the President of the United States in person."
Trump regularly answers reporters' questions when he leaves the White House or attends public events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, press conferences held alone are rare.
As to why, it may be inferred from what happened this week, when the president in New York has produced an unusual and bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
The head of the health department sent a letter to the EU staff of NHS Scotland for concerns about Brexit
The head of the health department sent a letter expressing the gratitude of the country to its employees from the countries of the European Union in Scotland and stressed that he hoped they would stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's expected exit.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs associated with the established legal claims of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In a letter from Freeman, he wrote: “In the summer, the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union continued, which are expected to result in a decision in the autumn.
The UK Government has also embarked on the preparation of a possible non-consensual scenario.
I am aware of the worrying period that this may be for you.
That is why I would like to emphasise once again how much I appreciate the efforts of each member of the team, regardless of the country they come from.
Staff from different EU Member States and other countries provide valuable experience and expertise to help the health department, which has a positive impact on patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home, and we would very much like you to stay with us."
Christion Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after a head injury.
The Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, Christion Abercrombie, had an emergency surgery after losing to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday at 31-27, reported a head injury in Mike Organ Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury occurred shortly before the half.
“He walked out to the shoreline and just collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaching team and the medical staff first gave Abercrombie oxygen at the edge of the field, then put him on a gurney, and took him for further examination.
One of Tennessee State officials in Nashville, Tennessee, told Chris Harris, a WSPV reporter, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “he has no further details on the type and extent of the injury at the moment” while Tennessee State is working to determine exactly when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie spends the first season of the Tennessee State team where he transferred from Illinois.
On Saturday, he introduced five successful outfits before leaving the field, so he's already at 18 in the season.

According to the Treasury's calculations, this would amount to £120 million a year, which would be used to support the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher fee for real estate purchased in the United Kingdom, and the additional income from it will be used to support the homeless, and Theresa May is about to announce at a press conference today.
The aim of this step is probably to counterbalance the success of Jeremy Corbyn among young voters, which he has achieved by promising more affordable housing and high-income measures.
The increase in the levy will affect individuals and companies who are not taxing in the United Kingdom and the additional income from it will be used to combat homelessness.
The additional charge added to the current levy, which, in addition to the higher levy on second dwellings and properties purchased for expenditure purposes two years ago, could be up to three per cent.
The Treasury expects an annual revenue of £120 million as a result of the measure.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built London real estate is purchased by citizens outside the United Kingdom, causing a significant price increase which makes the situation of the first home buyers increasingly difficult.
Many of the rich districts of the country have become "spirit cities", especially in the capital city, as many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill arrived only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in fees to help young people prepare to wait for their first home.
He personally holds large construction companies responsible for keeping house prices high, who have become a habit of buying and leaving areas on the ground. He asked May to abolish quotas for affordable houses and to do something about the "housing market shame" situation in the country.
Corbyn has announced remarkable proposals for a range of housing reforms, including rent control and removal of evictions without a valid reason.
It would also give the council more powers and opportunities to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said that I would like to devote my prime ministership to restoring the English dream and to making life ever better for each generation.
To do so, the situation on the real estate market needs to be resolved.
Britain remains, as always, open to those who want to live here, work and start a family.
However, it is not right for individuals living outside the country and companies with foreign interests to buy real estate as easily as hardworking citizens in England.
Dreams of my own home have become almost unattainable for too many, and the unworthy state of homelessness has become too accessible."
Jack Ross: "My greatest desire to be the manager of the Scottish team"
Jack Ross, Sunderland's coach, stated that "his greatest desire" was to become the manager of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish coach would like to take on the challenges of resurrecting the North-East Club, which is currently in third place in the first-class league, with only three points behind the first place.
He moved his seat to the stadium called Stadium of Light after successful return of the St. Mirren team to the first-class Scottish football championship in the previous season.
“I also wanted to play for my country as a player.
Unfortunately, however, I only managed to get into the reserve, said Ross in his programme BBC Sportsound.
When I was a child, I watched the Scottish team play a lot with my father in Hampden, and something always pulled me back to them.
But now the only way to get a chance is to succeed as a club manager."
In Sunderland's position as manager, Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach at Alloa Athletic is not nervous about the need to follow in the footsteps of such great names and has previously rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's offer.
“I am currently measuring success to see if I can get the team back to first class.
If we look at the structure and facilities of the club, it must belong in the first class league, he said.
“It will not be easy to get back, but it is more than likely that I will only see my activities here as a success if I manage to get the club back.”
Ross' career as manager began only three years ago, after working for a period of time as a substitute coach for the Dumbarton team and spent 15 months in the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Aolla recover after the team fell back into the third class, and with St. Mirren on the verge of losing, he won the championship next season.
Ross claims he's feeling more confident now than ever in his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, or Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real defining moment, ” he recalled as Alloa’s coach.
– I clearly thought that managing was more for me than being a player.
That sounds weird because I've done well, and I've had a pretty good life out of it, and I've had some really memorable moments.
However, sometimes the life of players is very hard.
There's a lot to go through every week.
Of course, I still have to cope with the stress and pressure of work, but management tasks lie with me.
I've always been interested in managing, and now that I've tasted it, it's the best time for me to feel like I'm growing up."
The full interview will be broadcast on the Radio Scotland channel on Sunday, September 30, from 12:00 to 13:00 local time.
According to a study, beer is best served at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
In the summer heat wave, traffic in England's pubs has increased significantly, but the restaurant chains are still under a lot of pressure.
According to the data collected, the revenues of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, employee of the CGA business consultancy company, which compiled the statistics, said: “Thanks to the sunny period and England’s longer-than-expected World Championships, the trend of the previous month continued in July, when pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in revenues, with the difference that even more declines in restaurants were observed.
In June, the revenue decline in restaurants continued to deteriorate by 1.8%.
Pubs and bars, which mostly sold alcohol, were the best performers, who produced even more growth than the loss at restaurants.
The pubs offering more food were also uncomfortable with the long-lasting sun, although not nearly as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
People seem to prefer to drink at times like this.
The revenue from drinks from pubs and bars operated by companies increased by 6.6% this month and food revenues dropped by 3%."
According to RSM analyst Paul Newman, “These results have followed the trend since the end of April.
Weather and major community and sporting events remain the main source of revenue for the entertainment and catering industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant chains are in a difficult situation, and a reduction of 4.8% per annum may be particularly painful due to continued cost pressure.
The long, hot summer for restaurant operators could not have come at a worse time, and it will only be over time to see if the temperate weather in August will bring relief in this area as well."
Total revenue growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened places, was 2.7% in July, which also reflects the slow pace of the introduction of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors the sales of the UK catering sector (pubok, bars and restaurants) and is widely accepted as an industry benchmark, collects and analyses performance data from a 47-member group of more than 9 billion important operators.
One child out of five has a social media account that he hides from his parents
According to one survey, one child out of five (even at age 11) has a social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of “Insta-sides” is increasing
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content
20% of students replied that they had a "head" drawer that their parents could see
One child out of five (even at age 11) creates a social media account that he hides from adults.
According to a survey conducted by 20,000 high school students, the number of "Insta Accounts" is increasing rapidly, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news increases the fear of sharing sexual content.
20% of students replied that they have an immaculate "main" account that their parents can see, but they also create private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret side found a teenage profile that said “rape me.”
According to a research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headsmasters’ and Headmisses’ Conference (HMC), representing the directors and directors of independent schools, 40% of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, and 50% have acknowledged that they have private accounts.
“I find it worrying that so many teenagers feel the need to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot reach them,” said HMC leader Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "sound of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Association
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletic Association at the annual meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful athlete, and according to the board president Ian Beattie, the wide international experience of the athlete over the last decade will be an invaluable help to sports decision-makers.
"Eilidh has a huge reputation in Scotland, the United Kingdom and the international athletic community, and his presence will help the development of Scottish athletics," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help the Scottish sports leaders."
Of the four Olympic gold medals of the American athlete who regularly spoke as an expert on the BBC, two were obtained at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at 200 metres and 400 metres, but were forced into a wheelchair due to a temporary brain circulatory disorder.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that in time, it would decide if I'd ever be okay.
I've been working hard, but I've been fully recovered, I can walk again, I'm going to agile practice today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages."
A breast-sucking ad similar to a cow divides the online community
There was a heated online debate about the advertising of a breast-sucking company that compared nursing mothers to milk cows.
Elvie claims to have developed “the world’s first silent, wearable breast-sucker” and their product was advertised in an ironic commercial that evokes music videos, which showed the freedom the device gives to mothers who milk their milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a cow barn full of straw, while in the background they hear the lyrics of the following lines: "Yes, I'll milk myself, I don't even have a dick" and "If I haven't noticed, these aren't udders, but my breasts."
And the chorus goes, "I pump, I pump, the kid eats big, I pump, I pump, I milk girls."
The advertisement published on the company's Facebook page soon caught up in online debates.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments indicating mixed reception. Many say that advertising makes fun of the “creepy” of the dairy industry.
“Promising the product with very distasteful cows.
Like us, their bodies produce milk only if they give birth to offspring, but their wines are taken from them within days," recalls one commentator.
Elvie breast-sucking can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother )
Another comment says: “Yes, it is terrible for both the mother and the calf.
But why not use them to sell a breast pump to mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else added: “It’s a completely insensitive ad.”
Others came to defend advertising, a woman admitted that she thought the video was "terrible funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought it right away if I was still breast-feeding.
I felt like a cow, too.
It's a crazy commercial, so I'm not even trying to see it anymore.
The product is brilliant," he wrote.
Another commentary said: “This is a funny advertisement for mothers milking their milk at work or in a toilet, who feel “cow” because of it.
It does not glorify or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show that they had the discreet breast-sucking in their bras the whole time they danced.
The campaign is based on the feeling that women who use breast-suckers sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is quiet, does not use wires and pipes, can be discreetly placed in a breast-feeding bra, so that women can move freely, hold their children or even get out while sucking their breasts.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and communications director of Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is a revolutionary product, so it had to be advertised boldly and provocatively.
By pointing out the parallel between milking women and milking cows, we wanted to draw attention to the challenges posed by the use of breast-suckers and to show in a funny way how our breast-sucker gives us a sense of freedom compared to this."
Elvie's breast pump wasn't the first time on the news.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two entered the runway in Marta Jakubowski's dress while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children in custody has reached a record, while the number of monthly border crossings has not changed much. This is partly explained by the fact that it is more difficult for them to find reception homes because of the harsh rhetoric and measures taken so far by the Trump administration.
Hosts are typically illegal immigrants themselves, and fear that they might compromise their chances of staying in the country if they applied to receive children.
This threat continued to grow in June when it was announced that parents applying for a host and adults living in the same household should give fingerprints and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, Chief Officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted last week in his statement before Congress that dozens of people who had applied for the admission of unaccompanied minors had been arrested.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no criminal record.
“80 % of the applicants and those living in the same household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are convicted criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to search for such individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up the procedure for children, new rules have been introduced, according to which some of them have to appear before the court within one month of being detained instead of the 60 days so far, claims social workers.
A lot of people sign up in court via a video conference call instead of a personal appearance to apply for a residence permit.
If the judge doesn't grant legal protection, the immigrant will be deported quickly.
In recent months, social workers and system workers have reported that the longer the detention takes, the more nervous and depressed the children become, and the chances of violent outbursts or escape attempts increase.
According to legal defenders, these risks are only increased by a large facility like the one in Tornillo, where the number of children makes it harder to identify those in need of psychological care.
They added that if they did not give the children enough time to prepare or to say goodbye to friends before they were transferred to such a facility, they would expose them to even greater trauma.
Syria has called for an immediate departure from the "occupational forces" of America, France and Turkey.
Despite the 8th year of civil war in the country, the Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, who spoke before the UN General Assembly, asked Syrian refugees to return to their homeland.
Moualem, a deputy prime minister, claimed that foreign forces entered Syrian territory illegally on the basis of the fight against terrorism and "this is how they will be treated."
"They must leave immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moulem asserted that “the war on terror will soon end” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives and millions have been forced to leave their homes since 2011.
He declared that Damascus “continues his holy struggle to cleanse the entire territory of Syria” of terrorist groups and “the illegal foreign presence.”
The 2000 soldiers of the United States are in Syria, most of them assisting Kurdish forces and the Arab militias fighting against Bashar al-Assad as trainers and advisers.
France has sent over 1,000 soldiers to the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moulem claimed that the conditions were right for their return and that only "some Western countries" arouse “irrational fears”, deterring refugees from returning home.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help the population return home, ” he said.
- They made politics out of a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide reconstruction aid to Syria until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and his opposition on the end of the war.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, which creates a buffer zone around Idlib, the last great citadel of insurgents, can facilitate further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented the Syrian government forces supported by the Russians from launching a wide-ranging attack on the province of three million inhabitants.
Moulem stressed, however, that the agreement set out "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would only be directed against jihadists, including the An-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which should be "extermed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that a committee of delegates from the government and opposition may soon be convened to prepare the post-war Syrian constitution and prepare elections.
Moualem considers the participation of the Syrian government in the committee to be acceptable to conditions such as "revision of certain articles of the current constitution" and warns all external actors against interfering with the process.
That's why they're gonna re-elect Trump.
Following this logic, Trump will surely be re-elected in 2020, unless the hopes of many liberal viewers come true, and a process of accountability or a scandal will put an end to his presidency prematurely.
We can be sure that this would be "the most dramatic presidential finale of all time."
For now, however, the audience is enjoying the show.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have nearly doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled its ratings to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen's data, Fox News is attracting an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time instead of 1.7 million four years ago, and the most watched TV show on MSNBC is The Rachel Maddow Show with its 3.5 million audience on the evenings of the major news days.
“It attracts us like a fire because it is something we do not understand,” said Neal Baer, the leading producer of ABC’s drama series “The designated survivor”. In this series, a low-ranking miniser of the Cabinet sits in the chair after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
Nell Scovell is a veteran comedian, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club”.
This is how he recalls a road to Boston before the 2016 election:
The driver told me he was voting for Trump.
"Why," asked Scovell.
“Because it makes me laugh,” the driver replied.
It's the entertainment of chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington can determine the fate of cases like Roe vs. Wade's precedent, whether or not immigrant families can be reunited and the stability of the world economy.
Only a very narrow layer can make you ignore these facts.
However, it is no longer part of the responsible information that we have been watching for the sixth hour of a debate about the authenticity of anonymous background conversations used in Bob Woodward's book Fear, or Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (the clothing of arrogance in the form of The Washington Post) or the consequences of his description of Stormy Daniels Trump, um, anatomy.
As far as I'm concerned, it's always gonna come back to me about Super Mario.
“You feel a little bit like watching a reality show where you get something new every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Managing Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, the creator of the “Longstars”. Trump's show constantly changes the characters, and every day the new turns come (he goes to N.F.L., he starts to praise Kim Jongun).
If you miss one episode, you'll miss it.
When I got to Fleiss this week, it was a pleasant, 26-degree, sunny weather in Kauain, and he was still in his house looking at MSNBC while recording CNN's show.
He couldn't get away from TV as Brett Kavanaugh's hearing in the Senate Justice Committee began, where the future of the Supreme Court itself was at stake.
“I remember when we were making those crazy shows, many people said that this was the beginning of the end for Western civilization, ” recalls Fleisch.
"I thought they were joking, but apparently they were right."

Both parties are pouring money into the closest competitions in the mid-term congressional election
No one was surprised that both parties in Pennsylvania's 17th constituency spend money uncounted after two active representatives fought for the same chair after drawing the congressional districts.
One of the competitors for the recently redesigned district of Pittsburgh is the Democratic Conor Lamb, who obtained a mandate in an interim election last spring.
Lamb's opponent, the Republican Keith Rothfus, is currently a representative of Pennsylvania's former constituency of 12 which has a significant overlap with today's district 17.
The map had to be redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former district borders were manipulated to the advantage of the Republicans.
In the fight for the 17th district, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) bid almost on each other during the campaign.
Lamb’s name became known in Pennsylvania after winning in close competition the March interim election in Pennsylvania’s Congressional Constituency 18.
For more than a decade, the congressional seat belonged to the Republicans, and Donald Trump won the district with a 20 point advantage.
According to political experts, Democrats have a slightly better chance of winning.
The United States considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, and then abandoned the plan.
According to diplomats, the Dominican Republic and Panama have already sided with Beijing, which Washington barely responded to.
Donald Trump had a good time meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners pushed out the Trump Organization leadership team.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called back major US branch staff from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to their "decided not to support Taiwan" – Heather Nauer, spokesperson of the Ministry.
However, sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received around $140 million in US aid in 2017, including in the fight against drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed criminal measures, such as the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have had a painful impact on the Central American country, where unemployment and murder rates are also extremely high.
As private meetings continued, North and Central American representatives postponed a high-level conference on security and economic issues, which would have been the continuation of a similar meeting last year, with the primary aim of reducing migration to the United States.
In mid-September, high-level representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, which clearly indicated that they did not want to punish El Salvador.
They announced that at the conference scheduled for mid-October, Vice-President Mike Pence will also speak, which, according to diplomats, is a clear indication of how important the administration considers the event.
The three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, and Washington did not issue condemnative statements and did not take punitive measures.
John Bolton’s White House spokesperson refused to comment on the details of the debate, which were reported anonymously by the three US officials, including two diplomats.
Their reports were supported by external analysts close to the administration, who were also only willing to speak anonymously.
Historical Experiences
The next blow could be a report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who's investigating Trump's obstruction of justice in some way... and a number of facts released to the public indicate it.
Mueller's investigation is also reported to include the fact that Trump's team has cooperated with Russia, which is trying to influence the elections.
If the Democrats are the majority in Congress, they will surely try to hold Trump accountable, who may have to face the judgment of his fellow politicians after the voters.
We can see that there are many uncertain issues, and Trump's downfall is far from inevitable... and neither is it for his European principles.
Serious decisions must be taken on both sides of the Atlantic – depending on how long the fight will take.
In 1938, several German officers were ready to bang Hitler, just waiting for the West to side with the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
The aid was not supported, so it was not possible to prevent the bloodshed of the following years.
At historical turning points such as this, it is decided that the inevitable development of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
In today's America, we can identify several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Trump replaces Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in charge of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein’s chair has been wobbly since last year when, as our newspaper reported, he suggested recording conversations with the president and suggested that Trump was unfit for his office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times misreported the events.
“How will we react if the F.B.I. investigation against Brett Kavanaugh becomes biased or incomplete and is appointed to the Supreme Court in spite of a credible sexual harassment charge?
And the most important question is, in the interim election, are we voting for a Congress that is prepared to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these trials, democracy will be a long winter.
I trust it won't happen, especially because of my experience in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, the same regime that once was located in a building serving as my ambassador’s home.
My mother survived the Holocaust, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she asked me to light candles on the table bearing the symbol of swastika during the Sabbath.
With such cultural heritage, how can I be pessimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans is playing for Rangers before the game against Rapid Wien.
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday. The victory against the Austrians after an unexpected draw against the Spanish Villarreal can ensure their participation in the European League Group G.
Due to the knee injury of the midfield Graham Dorrans, he was unable to enter the field in the season until the match against Villarreal 2-2, but he feels that, building on this result, Rangers can set themselves bolder goals.
“It was an important point against a great team called Villarreal,” said the 31-year-old player.
– We believed that we were able to score, and we scored a point.
Maybe we could've scored another goal at the end, but we can't complain about the draw either.
They were better in the first half, and we were on it in the second half.
Thursday will be another important European match.
I hope we get the three points, but it won't be easy, because they were pretty good at their last game, but with our fans behind our backs, we'll definitely have the strength to win.
Last year was hard, I was injured, the club had a lot of changes, but now the mood is very optimistic.
Our team's good, the kids are enjoying the game, the workouts are going well.
I hope that if we do our best, we can put the last season behind us and achieve good results."
A lot of women worry about not saving enough money for their old age.
The surveyers had accurate ideas about their desire for elderly care, but only a small part of them talked about it with their family members.
According to the Nationwide survey, only half of the respondents discussed the expected costs of their elderly care with their spouse.
Only 10% of them answered that they talked to their children about it.
"Everyone wants to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't usually raise the issue," says Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's what's worth doing.
First discuss the question with your spouse and children: You can’t expect them to take proper care of you if you don’t tell us what your needs are in time.
Together with your advisor and family, choose where and what care you want; these decisions will have a significant impact on future costs.
Involve a financial advisor: he can give useful ideas on how to pay for the planned care.
Funding may take place with a traditional insurance policy designed for old-age care or a life insurance policy combined with hybrid savings that can cover expenses or use your own assets as collateral... if you have the resources to do so.
Prepare the legal documentation: This way, the possibility of later litigation is cut in advance.
Trust a representative, a trusted person, who acts on your behalf in health matters, supervises your medical care, and ensures that everything is done according to your expectations, even if you are unable to communicate.
You should also hire someone to handle your finances.
This trusted person makes the necessary financial decisions and arranges for the payment of invoices when you are not able to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Suppose your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Record these data in writing so that they are available at any time.
"It's not just the financial issues that need to be clarified, it doesn't matter who your doctor is," Martin added.
‘What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned in advance."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people lost their lives when a massive earthquake hit the city of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, and then a tidal wave.
The region's communication network has also been damaged, so no news has been received from the Donggala governorate north of Palu, where it was the centre of the 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated in Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Celebes:
Palu was built at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Celebesz, the capital of the province of central Celebes, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding when the earthquake and tsunami struck it.
Donggala governorate stretches over 300 km on the northwest coast of Celebes Island.
In 2017, the population of the government, a smaller administrative region than the province, was approximately 299 200.
Central Celebese is mainly characterised by fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Donggala.
Nickel mining is an important sector of the economy, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the other side of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Response Agency, Palut and Donggala have been hit several times by a tsunami in the last 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, a tidal wave hit West Tonggala, and nine people died.
Indonesia is situated in the geologicly active Pacific Fire Ring area, which is why earthquakes are common.
Just a few of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a huge seaquake began on the west coast of the Aceh province of North Sumatra, which launched a tsunami reaching 14 countries, which claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, and more than half of the victims died in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes rocked the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island near Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 quake shook the southern part of Java, the largest island in Indonesia, and the tsunami on its trail claimed almost 700 casualties on the south coast.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake destroyed Padang, near the capital city of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: 7.5 quake shook one of the islands of the Mentawa archipelago near Sumatra, and sometimes it caused a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A near-surface quake reached the governorship of Aceh Pidie Jaya. The panic and destruction of his trail have brought back many memories of the terrible tsunami in 2004.
This time, there was no tidal wave, but more than 100 inhabitants died under the collapsed buildings.
2018: Lombok is a popular Indonesian island among tourists; a powerful quake here claimed 500 lives, especially in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of buildings have become equal to the ground, and thousands of tourists are stuck on the island for a while.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, Sarah Palin's son, former governor and candidate vice president of Alaska, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29 years old, lives in Wasilla, Alaska, and is suspected of having committed domestic violence, prevented the announcement of domestic violence, and resisted arrest, said Alaskan state police.
According to the police report, when a lady friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, she took her phone.
Palin's being held in the Mat-Su detention facility, and he's been bailed out for $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and answered the question about his guilt, “not guilty at all”.
Palin is charged with three Class A violations, which means he can be charged with up to four years in prison and $250,000 fines.
He's also charged with a Class B violation that could result in a day-to-day detention and a $2,000 fine.
Palin isn't the first time he's been in trouble with the law.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, reported the alleged attack to the police.
The case is currently being dealt with by the Alaskan Veteran Tribunal.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and obstruction of reporting of the crime, as well as possession of weapons under alcohol influence in connection with the case.
His girlfriend at the time claimed he hit him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticised by organisations representing veterans when she attributed her son’s behavior to post-traumatic stress from the Iraqi service.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, hundreds of victims
At least 384 people lost their lives after a Friday earthquake on the island of Celebes, Indonesia.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tidal wave that destroyed thousands of homes.
The systems responsible for power supply and telecommunications have gone out of order, and the number of dead will probably increase in the next few days.
The center of the earthquake was near central Celebes, northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
A number of videos of the tsunami have been released on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered on the coast of Palu at a ceremony, and that was when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors have filed a death penalty for a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect of an eight-person terrorist attack in New York City.
30-year-old Saipov was accused of driving a truck rented from Home Depot in October on a bicycle road on Lower Manhattan West Side Highway, hit by several pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the legality of the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed eight of his victims "intentionally" and "intentioned" to injure them, in the submission of the New York District Attorney's Office.
According to the file submitted, proof of either of the two charges may justify the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged with 22 crimes, including eight counts of extortion killings, which had been used almost exclusively against organised crime and the destruction and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack called for "significant planning and premeditated intent", states the prosecutors, and Saipov, in their wording, carried out his actions in a "horrible, cruel, inhumane" way.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused pain and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
The South District of New York has recently requested the death penalty for a defendant for over a decade.
Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but in September 2009, he ended up in prison for life.
In a federal case in New York, a death sentence was last executed in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg: the couple were convicted two years earlier for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court documents, Saudiov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
During the interrogations, he claimed that he was delighted with his actions.
Saipov said the ISIS videos on his phone gave him the idea to attack, it's in the indictment.
According to the police, he asked for an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state defenders representing Saipov, said that they were "understandingly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the actual life sentence for a confession would have been more favourable, with the death penalty only prolonging the sufferings of all the actors involved in the case," says Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
According to Tory, NIGER FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage stated at the demonstration at the Tory Conference that he was “calling the army of the people into battle”.
According to the former leader of Ukip, politicians should feel the pressure of Eurosceptics after a party partner of Theresa May suggested that Farage should be entrusted with negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Peter Bone, who did not occupy any office, told the participants of the Birmingham meeting that the United Kingdom would have "learned" if Farage were the Brexit Minister.
The pressure within the party on May is well characterized by the pro-breeding Toryk speaking at another protest against Brexit in the city.
May is trying to implement the Chequers plan, which requires permanent migration between Brexit and the people who are pro-breeding and the EU.
According to his allies, despite the negative reactions, he is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels so that Eurosceptics and Labour can only choose between his package or "total chaos".
Bone at the Leave Means Leave demonstration held in Solihull said that the Chequers deal should be eliminated.
He suggested that Farage should be brought into the House of Lords and that he should be entrusted with the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had led the negotiations, we would have quit," he said.
The representative from Wellingborough added: “I will stick with Brexit, but the Chequers deal must be dealt with.”
Criticizing the EU, he said: “We did not fight in World Wars to be servants of others.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the assumption that since the vote in 2016, the public mood has changed: "There is no real basis for the British people to change their mind and want to stay."
The Brexit Tory representative Andrea Jenkyns also attended the meeting and said to the journalists: “All I ask, Madam Prime Minister, is that you listen to the voice of the people.
The Chequers deal is rejected by the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular among party membership, and especially among activists who work in the field and have helped us reach government.
Forget the Chequers deal and listen to us."
He added: “Only the Prime Minister who keeps his word can keep his seat. ”
Farage said at the meeting that politicians should “sense the pressure” so that they do not dare to betray the outcome of the referendum in 2016.
“Trust between us, that is, between the people and our politicians, is now at stake, ” he said.
"They want to betray the Brexit, and today we are gathered here to send a message that we will not allow them to do so."
He turned to the enthusiastic crowd with these words: “I want our politicians who are about to betray Brexit to feel the pressure.
We call on the people's army to win with Brexit, and we will not rest until we make the United Kingdom an independent, independent, proud country again."
In the meantime, the pro-stayers marched in Birmingham and held a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
Some activists were waving the flag of the "Toryk Against Brexit" movement this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis used the conservatives for the party's application because of the security errors that occurred at the opening of the conference.
“These people said that they had the IT background to a Canada-plus-plus agreement, to border crossing without disruption and to a free trade agreement with Ireland without borders, ” he added.
- They're bullshitting me.
There is simply no good Brexit", he stressed.
Warren is "considering carefully" to run for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the election in November, you would consider carefully running for president.
According to the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday at a public forum in West Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is preparing to re-election in November against the state Republican representative Geoff Diehl, co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
For some time now, there have been speculation that he may be the one to replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event was held in Holyoke in the 36th retail forum since Trump took office.
A participant asked if he was planning to run for president.
In Warren’s reply, he said that the time had come for “females to play a role in Washington in restoring the failed government, including taking the highest position”.
They arrested the person suspected of shooting Sims in LSU.
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that they had arrested the suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an 11 a.m. press conference on East Coast time.
Earlier, they released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man on the tape.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury from the gunshot that proved fatal," informed police captain Murphy J. Paul of the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports reports.
He intervened to protect Wayde's friend, that's when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted in the interrogation that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson's arrest took place without incident, and the man was detained at the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
In Baton Rouge, an adult, nearly 2 meters tall Sims played 32 games in the last season, played 10 as a beginner for an average of 17.4 minutes per match, scored 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton got closer to the World Championship after winning the victory in front of Sebastian Vettel thanks to team instructions
After Valtteri Bottas qualified himself better than Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's instructions would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas got off to a good start and almost got Hamilton into trouble because he defended his position in the first two rounds, which allowed Vettel to attack his teammate.
First, he stood up with Vet in the boxing alley and let Hamilton get stuck in traffic behind the middle field, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stood a circle later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead of a close action, during which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly left the inner curve free after twice moving as a defense in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, began from the back row of the dice, and by the end of the first round, he was number seven.
Then he drove most of the race because he didn't change tires to get to the finish line and overtake Kimi Räikkenen in the hope of fourth place.
Finally, he stood in the 44th circle, but in the remaining eight laps he could not increase his pace, so Räikkené became the fourth place.
“It was a difficult day because Valtteri had done a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman when he was instructed to let me go.
The team achieved the first two places with exceptional work," said Hamilton.
His body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday meeting because the senator insisted that she didn't leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh of being a new member of the Supreme Court of sexual harassment.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee, but merely noted that the things going on in the Senate prove that people are “spoken, hateful, and liars.”
“What can happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the past few days in the Senate, when they see anger, when they see that people are angry, vile, hateful, and liars,” he said.
“If we look at the statements and leaks, they say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
That wasn't me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember your answer... Did you leak the document? – "Oh, oh, what is it?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it.”
Well, hold on a second.
No, we didn't leak," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July, and the letter leaked at the beginning of September. However, Feinstein denied that the source of the leak was his office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims or leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to the report of The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and to keep it confidential as requested."
However, it seems that his denial was not accepted by the president, who noted at the Saturday evening meeting: “I will tell you what is going on: his body language was very bad.
He may not have leaked it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, claiming that the Democrats would use the alleged accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They can see the despicableness, the detestableness, they do not care who they hurt, who they have to go through to gain power and control," said the President.

Air Traffic Control lost its life to save hundreds of people on airplanes from earthquakes
As a hero, they celebrate an air traffic controller in Indonesia who lost his life while ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than eight hundred people died and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit Celebes Island on Friday, resulting in a tidal wave.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many have fallen under rubble in the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled to save their lives, 21 - year - old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the wildly swinging control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to allow Batik Air to safely take off on flight 6321 already on the runway.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was crashing.
Later he died in the hospital.
According to Air Navigation Indonesia's spokesperson Yohannes Sirait, the decision could save hundreds of lives, reported the case in ABC News, Australia.
We had a helicopter prepped from Balipapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We were heartbroken when we heard the news,” he added.
Authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could be thousands, and the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong, as reported by the country’s disaster response organization, are difficult to reach.
"The number of victims is likely to continue to increase, as many are trapped under the ruins and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the organization.
Waves up to six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry assistance and supplies.
A 35 - year - old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Emergency cars bring more bodies every minute.
Clean water's low.
The convenience stores have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing with time to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a real tragedy, but it could be a lot worse.
Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the country’s soldiers: “I ask you all to work day and night on the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" The CNN report.
Indonesia has already been hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok this year, where more than five hundred and fifty people have died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says that a person has disappeared in a plane crash in the lagoon
According to the latest announcement by an airline operating a plane crash in Micronesia, a Pacific lagoon, a man disappeared, although previously claimed that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini's press release, the situation on Sunday afternoon shows that a male passenger cannot be accounted for.
According to the airline, he's working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to additional information on the passenger, such as questions on age and nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crews after they crashed into the flying water while landing at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been hospitalized.
According to the airline, there were six passengers left in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of the events are still unclear.
According to the airline and U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon outside the airstrip.
Witnesses say the plane missed the runway.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said that the plane was flying very low.
"This is a tremendously good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that along with others, he was able to run me down into the sinking plane's emergency exits with force to the waist.
According to him, the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, shipmen repairing the wharfs nearby helped rescue people and carried them on an inflatable boat to shore before the plane sank 30 meters below the surface of the water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have been killed in accidents involving airlines registered with PNG in the last two decades, but none of them have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiled the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor presented it to the prosecution on Saturday at the retrial of the man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, testified for hours as an expert in information analysis.
He told the jury how he put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers with the help of his cell phone records on the night of her death.
According to Rowlett, he received location data from several phones, according to which he was with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicts the man's previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was near Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford gave his testimony on Saturday, saying that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "was lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks ago at the time of her death.
According to cell phone records, they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett reported that after Chambers died, Tellis deleted her text messages, calls, and contact details from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing speech on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be brought to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
New York nanny sued me for dismissal of a party after a "racist" message
A New York nurse filed a case against a couple for dismissal as a result of discrimination, after a falsely sent message to her, the mother complained that they had been able to apply a "black" nanny again.
The couple denies being racist and comparing the lawsuit to "extortion."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed his disappointment when in 2016 the new child care provider Giselle Maurice arrived and saw that she was black on her first day of work.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of your husband, you sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his blunder, the "unpleasant" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Ms. Maurice, claiming that the departing nurse, who was African-American, was doing a bad job, expecting more of a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home with an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the party for reparation for dismissal, and he is asking for a daily compensation of $350 for the six-month period of boarding work for which he was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them how to stop the procession, this cannot be done,” he said to the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it is discrimination.”
The couple responded to the claims that they were accused of racism that the termination of Maurice’s application was reasonable because they feared that they could not trust him after he had been violated.
“My wife sent him something that she did not mean.
It's not racist.
We are not racist," said the husband Joel Plasco to the Post.
“But would you trust your children with someone who, if by chance, was rude?
Your newborn?
Come on!"
According to Plasco, the lawsuit resembles "extortion," his wife only gave birth to the baby two months ago, and "he was in a very difficult situation."
"Would you attack someone like that?
It is not very nice to do this," the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are under way, the public court has already quickly condemned the party in social media, condemning their behaviour and logic.
According to a letter we just found, Paddington's publisher was afraid the readers wouldn't be able to connect to a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
This information is quite amusing now, when we already know what a huge success Paddington is."
According to him, his father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he felt the inspiration to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, would not have resented his work being rejected, and then added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the book was bittersweet after his father's death last year.
He called Paddington “a very important member of his family” and added that his father was very proud of his final success.
"He was a very quiet man, he was not cocky at all," he said.
“But since Paddington was almost real to him, he was like a child who was going to do something: we are proud of him, even if we did not really take credit for him.
I think he must have seen Paddington's success like this.
Although he created it and came out of his imagination, he always credited himself with the merits of Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When he landed, he and his daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought for his life in vain.
“Nad called regularly to tell me that he was in very bad shape and that he was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that my daughter was going to die in the next two minutes, and I have to say good-bye.
I said goodbye.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly ran out and then left his system.
He died a long time ago, and then everything stopped.
All I had to do was sit there and wait and see that it was all over.
I couldn't cry or scream or cry because I was in a place where I was surrounded by families and people.
I couldn't leave myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in mourning the loss of her daughter, got on the plane with the others who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
“I bowed my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on that plane, I felt this overflowing sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much."
Card with grieving women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from throwing their lives away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards full of inspirational messages and emergency numbers on a bridge in Wales.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and then committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the same way that I feel every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Ms. Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising cook, and her grin stuck to everyone.
“He knew her by everyone’s smile.
They always said his smile would make any place."
However, before he died, he gave up his work because he was "in very bad condition."
Tyler, who ended his life with his own hands, was found by his 11-year-old ex-brother.
Ms. Davis said: “I was constantly worried that this would cause some kind of domino effect.”
Ms. David made the postcards with the aim of “finding out that there are people who can be contacted and talked to, even if they are just friends.
Don't sit quietly – you have to talk!"
Ms. Humphreys, who for years lost Ms. Davies' friend Mark, who was married to her for 15 years, shortly after the death of her male mother.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed, or anything," he said.
“Some days before Christmas, we noticed a change in attitude.
He was devastated on Christmas day: when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or anything like that."
He said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they had to deal with it: “It left a huge hole in the family.
It broke our hearts into little pieces.
But we must continue to fight."

Questionary Brett Kavanaugh's future as the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought that if we managed to achieve what he had requested – a limited investigation of limited duration – perhaps we could come to an agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that the committee feared that it would "fall apart" because of the party’s indecision.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters oppose the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is solely due to timing.
The interim election is only five weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans are not expected to do well, it will be much harder for them to get their man into the highest court.
George W. Bush answered the phone to call the senators and lobby them for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him, he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
A vote is held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive the minimum 50 votes in the Senate that would allow the Vice President Mike Pence to make a decision in order to include Mr. Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's dissidents "declined" under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean dissidents going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jongun came into power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Bjengszok quoted the Southern Ministry of Merger and said that in the last year he was 1127 dissidents compared to 2011, when this number was 2706.
Park said that closer border surveillance between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang did not comment on this information publicly.
The majority of Northern dissidents end up being South Korean nationals.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border to North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
Dissidents are accepted by China as illegal immigrants and not refugees and are often sent back by force.
The relationship between North and South, which is still at war, has improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, and their discussion focused on stalled nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This came with a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jongun in Singapore, where a broad agreement was reached on further cooperation with the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jongho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"In the absence of confidence in the Americans, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is unthinkable that we will unilaterally disarm our weapons," said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court.
The minority president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh the Supreme Court "histrician" and claimed that his behavior did not correspond to the work of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, she would be called "hysterical," explained Pelosi’s reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Justice Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional about protesting rumors that he was sexually harassing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and his voice shut when he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats, calling the accusations against him "grotesy and coordinated character killing", and was organized by angry liberals because of the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's behavior proved that he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I believe that he has excluded himself with his statements and the conduct he has shown against the Clintons and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked if he would try to hold Kavanaugh accountable, in the event that he filled the post, and if the Democrats had the majority in the House.
"All I'm saying is, if you don't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then it's not just for the Supreme Court, but it's not for the court you're in right now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently in a judicial position at the City Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions about the Payable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanugh is a conservative judge.
During Kavanaugh's hearings, he avoided questions about altering the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It is not time for a hysterical, biased person to be among the members of the court, and he expects us to be happy,” said Pelosi.
And women have to take care of it.
It's a legitimate outburst, anger that's been building up for months and years, and it can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," said Ms. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so rare, is it?"
“I had a great help from a woman who was working in a position of leadership, ” he continued. “ He told me that he was crying in anger, but he developed a technique according to which, when he started crying in anger, he told his conversation partner: “You may think I am sad because I am crying.
But I am angry.”
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was a great idea."
In part, they forgive tears as a sign of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the most vivid memories of my early work, from an office dominated by men, where I once cried in anger that an older woman — a cool manager I was always afraid of — grabbed me at my neck and took me to the stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy because they've upset you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat congressman from Colorado, worked on her presidential campaign with Gary Hart.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a hair called Monkey Business, and he fell out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, in deep frustration, found that there was no reason for him not to run for president himself.
“It was not a well thought out decision,” he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the competition, and they wanted the new candidate in the middle of the race.
Someone named him "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves."
Since the campaign has been going on for a long time, Ms. Schroeder has missed the fundraising, so she has vowed not to compete unless she collects $2 million.
It was a doomed battle.
He found out that some of his supporters gave the men $1,000, but he only got $250.
“They thought I was getting a discount, ” he meditated.
When he held a press conference that he was not running an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by feelings of gratitude for the people who supported him, as well as frustration against the system of fundraising and direct access to voters, and anger over sexism, that his throat was stifled.
"They must have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted.
“They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna write on my tombstone?
"Crying"?
How can the US-China trade war be good for Beijing?
The opening line of the trade war between the US and China was almost deafening, and while the battle was not yet over, the break between countries, according to experts, could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, launched the first warnings at the beginning of the year by taxing the most important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, as the new duties already concern a product worth USD 200 billion, effectively taxing half the goods from China to the USA.
In all cases, Beijing has retaliated, most recently imposing a duty of between five and ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight back every time, and the second largest economy in the world will certainly not back down in the near future.
If you'd like to get Washington to back off, that would mean you'd have to give in to the demands, but public bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Chin-ping, the president of China.
Yet, according to the experts, if Beijing is a good tacticer, the US's trade war pressure could be good for China in the long term, as it reduces dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could push any of the economies of the two countries into an economic vortex is much more serious than the observers had previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant for Asia at the New American Security think tank.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, says the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help in rebuilding a country that has been destroyed for more than seven years in war.
In his speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Valid Morallem claimed that the state of the country was improving.
"The current situation is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists, restoring normal conditions.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, who had to flee between terrorism and autonomous economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations has calculated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Another six million people in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Moallem said that the Syrian state would welcome all the help it could get to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or contributions were not accepted from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team 16.5:10.5 at Le Gold National outside Paris.
For the sixth time in a row, the USA has failed on the European scene and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe defended its championship title, as Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn reached 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
Phil Mickelson is an American star player who struggled throughout the tournament, throwing his punch into the water at the par-3 16th hole, giving Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer Molinari was shining in all circles, so he became one of the 4 players who had ever achieved the 5-0-0 result since the tournament started in 1979 in its current form.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest-ranking player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen, Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, one of the best players in the world, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter, England, who may have been in his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder-cup veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, has become the best European winner of the tournament with a score of 25.5 careers.
“I usually don’t cry, but I couldn’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for his choice and faith in me.
I'm so happy. I'm so happy I got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm happy that I could help," he said after Garcia's emotional victory in Europe.
The baton will be handed over to Jon Rahm, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday in two and one.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching this man," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France, and now he's got a 13-21-3 career record at the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 titles, and only preceded by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played excellent golf throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing results of US team captain Jim Furyk, he said: “He was proud of these guys because they fought.
There was a time this morning when we set fire to Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of your players played very well.
We're regrouping our team, working with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You're gonna have to lift your hats, too.
The opponent was better than us."
