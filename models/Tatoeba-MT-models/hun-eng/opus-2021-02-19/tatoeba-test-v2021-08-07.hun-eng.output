I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing dangerous work?

There's no doubt about it.
It's affecting everyone.
It's not over until it's over.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price of this is two euros.
It could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
She definitely freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow hasn't stopped.
It didn't stop snowing.
I don't care if you're coming.
Don't mention it.
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been poured on me.
I was beginning to realize that I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the other day.
Thank you for coming.
I thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of last week.
That was the day we were married, honey.
There had to be a reason for this.
It was sudden.
This happened when he was out.
It happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.

I find your novel boring.
I think we've lost some movie frames.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I could kill.

I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you should leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.

I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tomi's excruciating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.

I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're going the wrong way.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all screwed up right now.
I think you've got the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Thomas's girlfriend's name is.
I think you're gonna approve.
I think you look great.
I suppose you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in there in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you have a very good job.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi still lived in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom might be coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought it was you or him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me.
I'm under his influence.
I was very impressed.
It's an accident!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we talked about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts if it will work.
It's getting very late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be switched off.
This isn't the best solution.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's no secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, it's really bad today.
It's really expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time for bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diapers.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready when it's ready.
He'll be ready when he needs it.
It'll take you a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
Consequently, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
I don't seem to be needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
This could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
I might be late.
It's got to be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It needs fixing.
He never existed.
It never should have happened.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I took care of it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper elsewhere.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep her alive.
I was trying to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep an eye on him.
I'm trying to gather my thoughts.
That's a nice flag.
Big fur cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
It's a good plan, at least on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a watchdog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right now.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's ten o'clock already.
One of my dreams has always been to live next to a stream.
It's always the same song.
It's an environmental disaster.
This is an ugly business, Watson, an ugly, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing.
It's as much art as it is science.
It's all in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a strange question.
That's terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's been a tiring day.
It's been a rough day.
It's happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's burning.
Get on a cheaper bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I have goosebumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's well known that a bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
This is delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mari.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in no hurry.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
It seems to me you're an honest man.
Sounds like you're wrong to me.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's only fair that they get the same salary for the same job.
It's not even close to perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
He's starting to freak out.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a tough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
It's great you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to jump to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe the weather's been clean and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to express in words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
It's spookyly beautiful.
He's got a pretty big head.
Tall.
Kids should be in bed.
Stop throwing money!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important for parents to be on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
We have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to meet your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your conditions.
You don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's incredible, you know?
It's inevitable.
That's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's kind of important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
Today's the day to wash.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles and rays and sharks above it like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
The way he lives is pathetic.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
It's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's non-negligible.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
There's no need to cry about it.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't repent.
There's no point crying over the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
“ Three months later, ” says Tomi, “he’s fluent in French. ” “ Yeah, he’s at the top of his stupid brain. ”
It's only three days.
He's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's pouring out of a tub.
He spread his wings.
It's absolutely amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is manifested in the defamation of the working class, acquitting imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars which it excites, and in immersioning the core of the idea that endless wars are the cause of man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
Few large gardens are located in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to be home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically, it's possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
I still have to answer that.
It's time to pick up our tents.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about it.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for that right now.
Too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn time.
Colds suck.
It's ugly, it's bright yellow and it doesn't harmonize with anything, but at least they won't run you down in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
There's no way anything serious is gonna happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's very amusing.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's the deal.
It's your only option.
A thorough learning of a language takes about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took nearly three years to build my house.
Everyone was caught off guard.
It took me exactly an hour.
It took me a lot of time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but we finally managed to find him.
I turned into a small alley.
I turned the page.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was wrong to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That's a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
That was a tragic accident.
It was a really good meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch black.
This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy for me to keep my promise.
That was a low blow.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.

You went out to eat, didn't you?
You've gone too far.
You've always been like this.
You were a teenager then.
You were just buying bread.
You cheated!

You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
What I'm about to say, you're not gonna like it.
You're not gonna win.
You're working too hard.
